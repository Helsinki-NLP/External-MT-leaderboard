28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Shopping Centre
A 28-year-old chef, who just recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead on the stairs of a local shopping center this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found in the Westfield shopping center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Legal Medical Agency.
According to the San Francisco police, the death is investigated as a crime.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked in a Boston chef, had found his dream job as a chef for the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock for them all.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family. We're missing a big," the representative says.
“Our thoughts are with Frank’s family and his friends.”
Louis Galicia tells Frank that he first lived in the hostels, but he had finally got his case in order.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn’t know anyone who would have wanted to hurt his little brother.
“He was kind and great.
His way of being together with the family was to put food to us all,” says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to have a dispute with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the stream.
Despite all the misconduct that happens in the world, he was an impeccable diamond that glowed every day,” he says.
Everyone who knows something about the case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department at the point number 415-575-4444.
The strike of junior doctors calls for new work struggles
Representatives of British junior doctors (who are mainly specialized doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade unions and requested permission for new work struggles in the dispute about a new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC), a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is asking its entire government for support for additional labor fighting activities from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not resolved the issues related to the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in the July referendum.
Of the voters, 58% rejected the agreement.
The Junior Medical Committee chairman Ellen McCourt posted a letter to JDC members on Twitter on Thursday afternoon, saying the government is "going on its own" questions that McCourt said led to the fight against the deal.
In the letter it says: “In this light, the JDC government in its vote has completely rejected the new deal proposal and requires that all of our concerns be conducted in new formal negotiations.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today sent a formal request to the BMA government, in which it will seek permission for slowly advanced labour combat operations from the beginning of September."
For the reason of the dispute, junior doctors have been in strike six times this year, including the first complete work failures ever seen in the UK’s public health system history.
BMA’s junior doctors director Johann Malawana resigned after the vote because he failed to accept the negotiated terms and conditions that BMA had recommended.
Malawana told BMA members at the meeting before the vote that the agreement was good and should be approved. The vote attended 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will enter into force and will apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: the alliance of foreigners?
It was the one who resolved the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hide for reconciliation and to officially end the eight-month war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish officer against his brother in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I had a clear impression that an increased desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties said,
But Putin’s smile seemed weak and he was hardly hot, even on his own holding measuring tree.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, repeatedly spoke of his “good friend” about Mr. Putin – according to a report five times.
I did not keep in the bills.
He also promised that the relations with Russia will be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, one of our country’s newspapers wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I realized his enthusiasm exactly the opposite.
But the constant cooling of Putin’s picture showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow to the event was angry.
Putin strictly attacked Ankara and accused him of rubbing his back.
The offense was even greater because it came from a presumed friend.
Getting back true confidence will be difficult, even impossible.
The opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
But suddenly it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most severe were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only so that Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have won some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring an assassination are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost excluded from power in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terror attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
The agreement also has a financial impact.
Russia’s sanctions have strictly hit Turkey, especially the charter flight prohibition, as several million Russians travel to the coast of Turkey annually.
The number has collapsed by almost 90 percent.
As it comes to Russia, travel organizers and charter companies will surely be surprised by the relief when air traffic can eventually be continued.
They put their faith in the late season of the river to the Mediterranean.
And even this week the state television has predicted that the prices of fruits and vegetables will fall as the imports of Turkish agricultural products will be allowed again.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” the Economic Journal said in an article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, because it believes the West is reacting fervently to the coup attempt.
Without forgetting the old sadness of Turkey’s progressive EU membership negotiations and Putin’s involvement in matters. Putin, who is enthusiastic to take advantage of the cool interfaces and break the Turkey’s bonds to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when he expressed his support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, which has its own tremendous concerns about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey could in their peak at the Prame Sea Palace transmit a picture one analyst described as a "alliance of foreigners": two countries that feel they are rejected by the West and treated likewise, unite their forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have great disagreements.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peace-builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
He says a lot that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue at all.
The President of Turkey refused to reasonably answer the question of disputes between the countries, while Putin, in turn, emphasized them.
There is no clear agreement between the countries on where they could pursue an agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster that the NATO member country Turkey caused when shooting down a Russian fighter, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are again even in speech.
Royal Bank of Scotland's banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of RBS, the bank’s operations outside Scotland will be restricted in such a way that it will continue to offer only business services, the so-called back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally associated with the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to withdraw from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer funding brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations Rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered to be right to allow more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used by the abbreviation RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted to NatWeste, with the exception of the headquarters and the stock exchange.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will get greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed during a presentation aimed at customers and staff at Inverness.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS is becoming an investment brand and because of the service our staff is because we are now becoming a bank of much more different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations Rugby, and it has raised the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
“Now it’s the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank a better customer,” says the bank’s chief executive.
“Three years ago it would have been a great deal if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and we took the brands in place.
But the work we do and the focus on the needs of our customers instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it’s the right time.”
Frankie Dettori riding with Predilection to win in Newmarket and achieved his 3,000th win.
The detector shows the champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant for him a 3,000. win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000 win in the British Championship series at Newmarket on Friday.
This edge he reached by riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same night on his own place on the track. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this row on a flat track in running competitions.
He has previously participated in Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time championship hockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is also here.
I'm very happy that this happened in Newmarket because it's exactly here I ended 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday afternoon and a 20,000-minded audience.
I am relaxed and feel great humility.”
Dettori receives hurricanes with Predilection after his victory
Two jockey players have reached the top in the blockbuster competitions, and they are championship hockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won in his record career more than 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockey of this time, and it's not surprising that it's just him who reached this edge that few have reached.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical advantage is what distinguishes him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the competition, his enthusiasm and passion has brought fans to the species for years.”
“I told Frank a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 matches unless he was competing only in the weekend and only in the big matches!
Seriously speaking, Frank's riding career in the UK matches has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a living person, which is good for the British race, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori winded his achievement in a characteristic way by flying down his horse back.
From flying landing to flying naked income, Frankie Dettori has been a model mark for British racing for two decades.
There are upper and lower roads.
He has won numerous large matches, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but in addition he has survived a flight accident and has been banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the competition ban ended three years ago, he had start-up difficulties, but he showed admirable strength of his character, showed his suspects and returned to his best.
And he’s not going to stop his career for a short time – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue competing at least until he’s 50.”
Putin resigns head of government Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned his head of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been belonging to Putin’s belief for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
According to the Kremlin's statement, President Putin "decised to release Ivanov from his positions as the head of the Russian presidential administration", but no reason for his resignation was stated.
Anton Vaino has been appointed as Ivanov's deputy chief since 2012.
The 44-year-old is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later led the President’s protocol department and the government’s chancellor, the Kremlin’s Russian-language website reports.
He thanked Putin for his appointment with the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the main task of the administration is to support your actions as the head of state, which means making the draft laws and monitoring how the guidelines you give are implemented.”
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had requested a break and recommended persecution to his followers.
Are the smile genuine?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long belonged to Vladimir Putin's close circle, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
During a Russian state television meeting with President Putin, both said Ivanov would withdraw from the post on his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince only a few, especially during parliamentary elections.
Are the expulsions a result of any kind of struggle?
No one knows it yet.
Russia has very doubtfully addressed the official claim that a man who was praised as a potential president would suddenly want to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov’s words to Putin, in which he says: “It’s true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to take my responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
I have been in office for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He has previously served as Deputy Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
When Putin served as the head of the Federation Security Service (FSB) replaced by the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was thought that Ivanov could become Russian president after Putin's second term, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin's election for the third term.
However, the task went to another nearby Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI researchers series star Thomas Gibson has been dismissed after hit a producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight in Los Angeles last month.
The series producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced the dismissal in a joint statement.
Special agent Aaron Hotchner, known for the series, had apologized Thursday before his resignation was announced.
“We had creative differences.
I’m sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
The information on how the character of Gibson is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios companies.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, the 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first production season, since 2005.
“I love Criminal Mind and I’ve put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement on Friday.
“I hope I’ll see it until the end of the series, but it’s no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great producing team and the most important: the best fans that the series ever could have hoped.”
The 12th production season will start in the United States on 28th September.
The Mysterious Flood of Fish in the Banffy Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are winds that have fallen to the ground in the wake of a cycling storm.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the beach, published a picture of the view at Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-century fish.
Queensferry's excesses are now associated with Fife
The $1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers have connected the Queensferry surplus to the northern coast and the land, meaning the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It is the first of the four parts between the "people's threats", which are now almost ready around the three columns of the bridge.
The bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wheels.
The $1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Highland.
We are all witnessing a truly significant progress in the construction of the bridge. Only for the construction of this bridge, more than 30,000 concrete and steel have been used.
Despite its massive size and weight, building the bridge between the ground and the bridge is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerance.
The entire bridge is now around 79%, and the rest of the bridge is getting its concrete landscape in Rosyth today, which means the bridge is ready to be lifted."
Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project manager Michael Martin says: “The completion of the first bridge is always a significant urethra in all bridge structures.
In this fantastic project, this percentage represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
When the last part of the trail was installed and connected to the North Tower column to the trail, then we had to close the remaining north-sided (i.e. land-sided) escape.
This was done by drawing the landscape from the north side 700 millimeters to the south.
This was a massive and at the same time high accuracy operation.
Massive, because the land is 222 meters long and weighs approximately 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up in an angle of approximately 3%.
And high accuracy was required, because the tolerance that the work team had to observe was very small – just a few millimeters.
Fortunately everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay's rescue agency tells three men's miracle rescue
In Anglesey, the three men who were caught in the water by their fishing vessels were saved by a miracle trade.
Moelfre RNLI maritime rescue station issued a warning on Friday at 13.20 local time after the crew found an accident in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men disappointedly tried to swim for safety while their boats continued to walk without a driver.
“We saw the boat rotating right next to them and we imagined the worst,” says Vince Jones, a rescue ship on Moelfre.
"To the time we reached the waters, strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them."
A local fishing vessel saved two of the men, while the third, aged 60 years old, was found exhausted covered with a hole and without a rescue vessel.
They were all taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a wonder that these three men who have fallen under the water are still alive and completely healthy.
The boat's engine had an emergency crash, but it had for some reason disappeared from the man on board when the boat crashed.
They were really lucky on their journey.”
Pokémon Go brings health and happiness
It is interesting to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have complained why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside to look at their roofs.
Pokémon Go makes people rise from the sofa and move.
Initially, the square time took only watching television, then in addition came video games and lastly smartphones.
It is important to note that science and technology do not interfere with each other.
Pokémon Go is a gaming app whose characters come from video games created in the 1990s (which later also made a draw series, gaming cards and other subjects).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that exaggerated the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost the same as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for their smartphones for Pokémon that is tracked by GPS. When a Pokémon is found, it can be "photed" (with the phone's screen image) or "covered".
Villitys has scratched the video game as younger, playing the generation and lifting the back of the sofa.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "medium person" takes per day.
The Washington Post recently that Apple Watch's smartwatch's Cardiogram app, which noticed within two days of the game's launch, that the number of moves for 30 minutes a day suddenly increased from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who of the users is playing the Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw data of the amount of activity.
Many public health campaigns, in which people are encouraged to get up from the sofa and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have swallowed on the narrow ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have seemed unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be undermined.
Regularly moving people are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps in weight management, reduces blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great part of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
Thus it achieves three basic aspects of health – exercise, clean air and sun and joy.
During the hunting, it is possible to get even new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also belongs to angry pleasants.
And yes, someone can walk to the door when playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough has been done.
Because even though smartphones like Fitbit may have been able to track your activity earlier, they did not give any reason to go out, as Pokémon Go does.
The news extinction disappears, and the use decreases over time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games in which applications and virtual reality are combined with real-world activity, increasing the exercise of people who go on the jail and improving their fitness and health.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hypothesis.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
The dynamic jump.
Untouched with the tree.
It has a permano.
Great in everything.
And finally the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American bodybuilder won the multi-match championship on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic Lighthouse.
His total score 62.198 was clearly better than the "Final Five" team colleague Aly Raisman and the Russian pronsimist Aliya Mustafina.
The U.S. Simone Biles will appear on the foam of the women's bodybuilding individual competition in the multi-match final on Thursday in Rion 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth in a row and the fifth American woman of all time to win the multiplayer championship. Thus, she consolidated her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles exploded in tears when his final points were visible and his long journey to this moment ended.
The accomplishment takes the species to a completely new dimension and raises him to the same class with other sports superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 world championship medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with so ambitious and accurate programs that 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest tennis artist of all time."
In Brazil, there was still one last competition, which took place primarily between Biles and the burden generated by his self and the excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Return home to Texas Springs with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
The U.S. Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman strike after winning gold and silver for women's bodybuilding individual competition in the multi-match final on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point over the country team with coordinates and now retired Martha Karoli's passengers.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought anything in advance when he was on the top for a long time, it is not completely true.
Some of his permanto program—which includes a series of volts known as his power card—is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It is not a coincidence.
The discovery of her grandparents as young as adopted and the mother of coach Aimee Boorman has become a power figure. Boorman found the girl when it was a day-to-day visit in the gym where Boorman was preparing.
He has not lost any multi-match competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning track is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina reached a small lead in two rounds, it was like a fabric.
The remains were the foam and the permanto, where Biles is a defensive world champion.
He returned to the lead position after obtaining 15,433 points and crowned the final result from the permano with 15,933 points.
Raisman loved him gently, waiting for the final points — which was just a formality — and tears began to appear around Biles' red, white, and blue-blank boundary, when the dream he once wrote in his playbook was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a small revanche to the competition four years ago, when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a renewal round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call the team a "mumb" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flights to the public after his permanto program and thus rose from the loss to the winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
What comes to Biles, this tweet that this 19-year-old made earlier a week and was widely spread now has a completely new meaning:
Police say three people were the victims of a serial killer listening to music in the car
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating mass murder in Phoenix in ten years. the victims were sitting talking in the car and listening to music when they were shot, police reports released Thursday.
On June 12, the police said the car was shot down by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the side of the car on the side of the passenger, from where he shot eight shots and then flew in another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the three-mord was not the cause of the robbery, as the attacker did not export the pockets or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether the death is associated with four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in Latin American areas within four months.
“The events are common that they have happened in residential areas in the presence of houses,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brune Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers don’t want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related to each other and that their factor is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis’ daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The observer told the police that the triangle had been sitting in the car frequently listening to music.
The police also published a statement in which it was that the shooting on an empty open-packed car was only half an hour before the three-mort.
The researchers found the shells and took the car’s seat to recover the shell and the motorcycle station to recover the shells.
The mother of a 6-year-old boy with microkephalia: "The times are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most other age colleagues, Edmund has microkephaly, i.e. a congenital infertility due to her mother Elizabeth Picciut’s genetic disorder, which she wasn’t aware of when she was pregnant.
“When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t get it out.
I will not survive this.
I am not committed to this.
What’s not true at all – of course you’re committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never recognize them and may not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far that they proposed to put the child in hospital care.
"The first reaction was that I didn't believe that such a practice would no longer exist at all," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a rollator.
Edmund stood up sitting and started connecting only at the age of three, and he is still not speaking.
But he progresses slowly at his own pace.
He walks assisted and runs a bicycle.
She loves to play with her two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's invented reference, which he means "song to me".
“We’re teaching him a reference language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not mean only the usual reference language, but it also includes the non-references invented by Edmund himself.
The background of microkephaly can be a number of different diseases: hereditary, such as in the case of Edmund, or pregnancy viral infections, such as strawberry or zika virus.
Symptoms and forecasts are varied.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with Zika virus.
Picciuto reminds of a storm caused by an uncertain future.
“When I’m constantly: how we’re going,
How is it with us.”
And he still doesn’t know.
“I’ve never asked for a prophecy, for I don’t think anyone can give it.”
But Picciuto has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by Zika virus.
“The times are getting better.
Things have a habit to be arranged.
You love your children, and your children love you.”
Heavy rainfall and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana on Friday declared a state of emergency due to heavy rainfall and widespread flooding.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have flooded over their edges and spread across the broad area as a result of heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and the aid is already on the way to flooding areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the National Security and Emergency Preparation Agency, said the agency will receive requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandstone.
According to Steele, only the district of Tangipaho has requested tens of thousands of sandheads.
The flood warning will remain in force until Saturday in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to the climate service, there is an additional 76–127 mm of water in the area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning was issued on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobilen region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that many houses on the river can fall under flood in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says the flooding underwater in the province of Ascension is a threat as the flooding rivers slowly empty into Lake Maurepas.
The River Tickfaw, which runs south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, on Friday at 9 a.m., has risen higher than ever.
The rescue work continued in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and sons were earlier on Friday near Gloster among the rescued.
Hansford, 62, tells us that the river Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters away from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other boy who was in the vicinity had warned him.
“We got up, and the water came with constant food,” Hansford says.
“It went on to my bag.”
His wife had told Hansford that she had never seen a river rise so high over the 48 years she had lived in the region.
Hansford tells him that he and his family members are all injured, and he himself is the only swimmer of them.
The rescue personnel had saved all three of the large army-style trails and brought them to the fire station to Gloster, where they held protection on Friday.
Weather forecast Krautmann says the floods will spread rapidly to the extent as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
According to a report from a nearby Livingstone observatory, there had been 350 mm of land between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was strongly drowned after the rains started on Wednesday.
The authorities say that due to the flooding of heavy rainfall and streets, residents of the district of Tangipaho were forced to rescue their homes and school hours were forced to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the town council in Tangipaho told CBS’s subsidiary WWL that there were 200 houses under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has overcome them both.
The county leader Robby Miller said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who had remained prisoners of the flood.
Evacuated people have opened shelters to Amite and Hammond.
"They will get back to their homes when the water begins to withdraw," he says.
In the city of Hammond, in the province of Tangipaho, twenty streets were forced to be closed due to the flood, and residents were offered sandbacks to try to prevent water from entering their homes and business premises.
“The last time we had a huge flood in March,” said Lacy Landrum, a member of the city administration.
“This flood seems similar.”
In Mississippi, the rain continued steadily on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Harrison County rescue director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy reports that a piece of the house was under the flood on Thursday, but no one has yet been on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store, says he has lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before, and more rain all the time.”
6-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survives a Philadelphia Attack
According to the police, a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, a six-year-old boy who has been shot in the city this week.
The grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the son is Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the son had several shootings in the joints, the spine, the arm and the stomach, but he was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of northerns," the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television company.
“I can’t believe this really.”
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he has been performed several operations.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting first class at a local undergraduate school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The other 29-year-old was to be in critical condition and the other two were in stable condition, CBS Philadelphia reports.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front of the car next to a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may be shooters.
Police researchers told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The event was filled with scraps of types of scraps, which come from a variety of scraps.
“It is clear that it was a struggle that was ongoing.
There were hills on both sides of the street.
There were several armed fighters on the site, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Supreme Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
They also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrest has been made, and the police are monitoring videos.
Another six-year-old woman who was killed this week was a girl whose hand was misleading when she played on Tuesday at her home in the West Oak Lane district.
The girl is recovering and the police are still searching for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabbya, and Laureta?
With this name, I invite the women's gym to the Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as powerful as it is now.
Second, the three athletes of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The team composition, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team will finally represent America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female trainer has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprising winner of the games, and all of America was thrilled.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible achievements of the three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and championship teline training programs.
On Thursday, Simonesta became the fourth in a row American to win gold in the multi-matches of the women's individual competition.
Aly Raisman won the silver.
The sights are such at the top of the species, but the same does not appear in the telinepower clocks throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same traces as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next Olympic team will have only four fitness players, and this is Marta Karolini's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a expensive sport and gymnastics are exercised primarily in private gymnastics bodiesined by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, premises, trips, performances, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
The premises of the majority of telinevial workshops are located in rich residential areas that are able to support the activity.
The teaching of gymnastics takes place in these sections, and it means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez' coach Maggie Haney have both trained the species fans since they started the teline training.
We need to organize a cheaper and more affordable gym training for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been raised by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own electricity foundation 20 years ago.
Harlem’s organizations have provided a free or affordable opportunity for the training of the gym for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin American) and some of these youths have surpassed to national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown, Detroit, so that we can provide high-quality teline training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this magnificent Olympics.
Strength training develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings sustainable benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has raised the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start a gym training, and it’s quite amazing.
Participation in some sports is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "childhood" you showed when you won the Olympic Cup, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way to be well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
The ministers hoped to resolve the dispute on wages and conditions of employment by approving a revised agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but the proposal was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors (specialized doctors) who voted.
In July, the Minister of Health Hunt plans to get the deal forced and said the British Public Health System (NHS) is "no one in the country" and that any additional delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that will include changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in non-social times.
BMA’s junior doctors committee chairman Ellen McCourt issued a statement yesterday night in which she says: “Junior doctors continue to be very prepared to the proposed agreement. A particular fear is that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There are only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move forward, because the time is over.
The BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speech, but the government has treated the negotiating companies unwantedly and sometimes without even reacting in any way.
It did it, despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt last month made a promise that his doors will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, the junior doctors will be ready for new work action.”
The previous strike in late April delayed 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception times, when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strikeing doctors for the strike guard.
The ministers hoped that the dispute on the amendments would be resolved by signing a revised agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The Association of Professionals BMA wants a better weekend break for 54,000 junior doctors to be affected by the agreement.
NHS staff chief Daniel Mortimer called for junior doctors to prevent new strikes.
Mortimer says: “Working action is very little or nothing, but it creates pressure on the teams and services that already operate at an extreme level and causes concern, anxiety and disorders to patients, care staff and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the junior medical committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other entities, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the disclosure of errors.
Employees were hoping that the continued positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training from a career crisis, education costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study freedoms and gender wage differences in the care sector – would be a sign of how serious employees, Health Education England, responsible for health education, and the Ministry of Health want to follow the agreements with BMA in November, February and May.”
$2.40 per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of cardiovascular patients are receiving a drug that costs about €2.40 a day, as authorities recommended it to be administered to more people and for longer-term use.
Ticagrelori reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already administered 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a member of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and evaluating the introduction of new treatments, has advised that tickagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now, the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and evaluates the introduction of new treatments, has indicated that tickagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people in England suffer from a heart attack each year, with a quarter of them recurring to a heart attack or they suffer from a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the fat that accumulates in the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plate breaks down, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot disappears, it can pass along with the blood flow and prevent the blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new stage is greater in people who suffered a once heart attack.
The British AstraZeneca Ticagrelor, which is sold under the product name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tulips.
Today published NICE’s programme proposal recommends the next 90 mg of the tickagrelor to be administered for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligram and asylum is administered twice a day for another three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at the Center for the Implementation of Therapeutic Methods (NICE), says: “Al effective therapeutic methods are available to prevent the progression of the disease and symptoms, even a quarter of those with a heart attack get a new stage or a stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
We have shown that tikagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of tikagrelor adds treatment options to thousands of people benefiting from it.”
Since the data on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited if it is used for more than three years, the plan does not recommend the use of the treatment for a longer period of time.
Due to the political correctness of the voting climate, the voting gap in Muslim regions flourished.
The former mayor of Tower Hamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year due to corruption.
The electoral atmosphere of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes of the widespread elections in Muslim communities, the government’s report today revealed.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles has severely criticized the police, electoral observers, and city officials for closing their eyes from the electoral foil "for ethnicity and religious over-sensitivity."
According to Pickles, known as the former regional minister and the current anti-corruption force, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police had to have permission to form guard chains outside of the voting places in order to protect the scared voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity certificate to be able to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only indicate his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to put the fingers into the unleashed black after the vote, so that no one can vote twice.
Reflectors should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He calls for improving the access of journalists to the State Council documents and to the decisions of informal committees and working groups.
“The aim is not only to prevent the elections, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and the culture that favors them more widely in local governments,” he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal in the East London Tower Hamlet.
Last year, a special election court ordered that then mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed due to corruption and numerous irregular procedures.
The court ruled that Rahman “defaulted the religious sense of his Muslim community and punished his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islam.
Rahman was said to "use the foundation of his campaign that the religious duty of every Muslim believer was to vote for him."
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or false so that the person voted by becoming another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of the false was received from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern over the post-election video in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were to have pressed people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to capture the voting system, including requiring an identity certificate at the voting site.
The report says: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the older members.
“We were worried that... state institutions had closed their eyes from such action because of ‘politically correct’ ethnicity and over-sensitivity to religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including the prohibition of the processing of post voting bills by political activists in order to prevent the "repair of noise".
Moreover, Theresa May’s reviewed report also requires stricter inspections of the registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and preference fraud.
Considering the options in which voters should be required to present their identity certificate before voting.
Drawing your fingers into the unleashed black after the vote so that no one can vote twice.
Systemic audits to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Establishment of a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
The prohibition of the processing of filled votes and mail textbooks by political activists.
The police have the right to form a guard chain around the voting places.
Amending the law in such a way that it is easier to raise trial charges under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the Extension of Voting Rights.
Prohibition of photography in voting places.
Only English is allowed in voting places (except in Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure that the staff is supervised by a rule that allows only one person to go to the voting camp at a time.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been raised after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The Supreme Court has dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative due to corruption and numerous illegal procedures," he said.
“He was found guilty without any suspicion and the criminal proof claim was exceeded by many grounds.”
He also criticized the ineffective "spyware inspections" by the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the municipal council.
“The court’s last year’s decision in the Tower Hamlet case was a awakening,” says Sir Eric.
“Our country is proud of her inheritance as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and hidden election campaign and its denial by some parties.”
Olympic bicyclist's similarity with Duchess Catherine and other double runners blurry at the Rio Olympics
Rio 2016 Olympics fans have divided this week the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose homogeneity with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But, according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a similarity with a well-known person.
In honor of the Rion matches and all the famous faces glorifying in our showrooms, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic representatives whose homogeneity with Hollywood celebrity is obvious.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison from the U.S. men's squad has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the double assembly of Duchess Catherine seen on the bicycle raids, many people have recorded on social media how one of the shooters could be the actor-like Leonardo DiCaprio's double brother.
Brady Ellison, the U.S. men's squad, caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures of him posted in which he reminds the star of the Wolf of Wall Street film.
Ellison was aware of the social media and acknowledged he heard from childhood that he reminded DiCaprio.
“I myself don’t see the homogeneity as so great, with the exception of the bridges and five,” Brady said to the Huffington Post.
“He’s a good guy, so I take it as a compassion.”
In the 2012 London matches, the britain's long-length shooter Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris had a similarity, which will undoubtedly be further highlighted in these matches.
Large and apparent Russian trainer Aliya Mustafina has been called the double-songwriter of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefa.
On the swimming pools, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared to the famous Matthew Morrison for years from the Glee TV series.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor of the Inception film.
Similarly, for a long time has been noted the similarity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, which is highlighted by both strong corners and lips.
Swimming silver medalist, Russian Yulia Efimova reminds actress Annalynne McCord, not just because of her beautifully broken skin and bright hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian is, according to his fans, a "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter, remind each other of their face shapes and eyes.
Not the only thing: this Twitter user was delighted as others also saw the simplicity.
This user is wondering if the pair is a good reason for the homogeneity.
One tweeted recently that he was pleased when "other on the internet agree on the homogeneity of Hope Solon and Jennifer Carpenter."
The American football star and the Dexter series actress truly remind each other of their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also noticed a similarity in the smile of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the winning gold worker Gabby Douglas and Anna Returns! in the broad smile of Gabrielle Union.
CBC's Olympic Commutator Apologizes After Saying A Chinese Swimmer "Dead Like a Pig"
Byron MacDonald's's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth instead of the women's 4 x 200 meters release message shouted the CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcasting company CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost his odors" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Speaker Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to disclose his own opinions at the end of the 4 x 200 meters release message final.
MacDonald, who was taken to the CBC news team to bring the color, was heard saying, “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, went out at a speed and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the message at 1:57.79, and left 1.61 seconds from Canadian Taylor Ruck, thanks to which Canadians were able to catch China.
Guests around Canada reacted quickly shocked by the commentator's tone and language use.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Are the CBC spokesman just saying that a 14-year-old Chinese merchant died like a pig???
The idiot didn’t realize he was still in the broadcast.”
In the final of the women's 4 x 200 meters release message, the swimming Chinese Ai Yanhan was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with angry comments criticizing Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
The tweets did not hold their words when they heard how unrighteous Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeted Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, the host of the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald’s speeches: “We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we’re sorry that this happened.”
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted as a response to the comment.
The commentary colleague Scott Russel was forced to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and attached its apologies to the comments of more than 90 other tweets that complained of MacDonald’s speeches.
The television company also quickly filed a public apology.
“We’re sincerely sorry for these statements and that they have been sent.
We quickly apologized to our viewers and also apologized to our followers on social media.
For clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the word selection was regrettable, and Byron is very regrettable for his words.”
On Thursday evening, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to defend his speeches by saying he did not mean it personally.
“I want to apologize for my comment that I gave yesterday evening after women’s interview,” MacDonald said in an Olympic message to CBC.
“I refer to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Not to say, it’s clear that I didn’t mean anything misleading in my words, and I’m very sorry.”
In Primark, a woman in the middle of the trade shocked the customers.
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman drowned in the middle of Primark to fit underwear.
He worsened the situation further by evaluating how he looked in the underwear, took it out of the foot and put it back on the roof.
He continued to tour and finally tried four underwear shops at a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark Chain Shop in the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping center, where the woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the plate
At the same time in the store, the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, tells us that after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, “People did not believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took the underwear from the plate, scratched her own t-shirts and underwear and dressed them on it.
He did not try to do it unnoticably, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone looked at him when he took the underwear he tried out of his foot, and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the roof.
He did it again three times before he finally decided he didn’t like anything from them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn’t feel careful about his eyes – he didn’t even think of a person who would eventually buy the underwear he had housed.”
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent Town, continues: “How indignant it is to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has used and has not washed them.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
“I understood that the trade staff tried to remove those clothes from the sale when the woman had left – what’s right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and see that someone else has taken them home without being washed afterwards,” Davidson added.
Primark’s spokesman commented: “Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from the sale.”
How to defend against the armed attack with Krav Magan
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a bit safer.
We interviewed Krav Maga’s New York-based mayor Rhon Mizrach and asked for advice on how to get rid of a near-range thief or malware.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker depending on whether the attacker approaches you before or backs you.
If the attacker approaches the back, the first thing you have to turn around is to see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then take the weapon so that it remains between the tear and the shoulders, and attack the attacker on your face with your free tear.
Then throw the attacker on your knees into your legs, and when he goes from the pain to a double degree, stretch him to his face with a pistol and take away by keeping the pistol directed to him.
The technique is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches the front. You have to move out of the gun line, infect the weapon and recycle it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time put your weight on the weapon and hit the attacker with a neck on the chest. Turn the weapon out of the attacker's pull, turn back and keep the weapon targeted on the attacker.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the thief is by giving up your cash – unless you’re a Krav Maga supermaster.
Ian Wright, a tourist in the world, drops the most dirty places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and his twist reflection on a hard test by throwing the most dirty and unpleasant places in Europe.
Suffolkian drawer and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance strength by throwing an eurosetle, a handheld in the Piccadilly Circus, a train bath washing button and a Russian general phone.
Before jumping, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see himself and show the spectators where his tongue was pushing.
The experiment was made in the documentary Ian Wright: The Trace of the Inner Power, and the results were surprising.
The idea of sliding the washing button in the train bath can be imagined, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen’s lavender.
On his journey to Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals on the strengthening of good intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he swallowed caused nothing but a misleading mouth.
Ian Wright became first known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The sliding of the railway stations and the washing button of the bathroom undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: "Since a child, I've been quite concerned about my health and wrapped my mouths of all kinds, such as soil, straw and water."
In the film, he actually demonstrated that his reputation is taxable.
The border was only encountered in a rough public bath in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For comparison, it should be stated that the number in the opposite hands is usually less than 60.
The boundary arrived in the Russian public bath, where Wright refused to shoot when the luminometer measured 4000 units – in the opposite hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with Valion in the documentary film Ian Wright – The Trace of the Inner Power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost a terrible smell that I have smelled in any bathroom.
Nothing is more dirty than this!
The place is so imaginative that I really don’t throw anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright – The Trace of the Inner Power in collaboration with Valion.
From the executive, Wright received a Valio Gefil from milk acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good intestinal bacterial resistance and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, category manager for Valio meal, juice and new products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is interesting to see and at the same time tells you about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we ended up thinking about asking Ian about it.”
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
"Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them to a broader connection and tell our daily environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and how it is related to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and with the help of the document we can provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our humor.”
Tom Hakala, director of the film, adds: “I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had swallowed certain items we asked for, such as the Russian bath, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, sliding some objects was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty spots described on the tape."
In a 2015 survey, 84 percent of respondents associated milk acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said they used products that had added milk acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A family of disruptors destroyed a city-owned renthouse in Saltash, Cornwall.
The family left 50,000 pounds of damage to the city’s rental house after they had been killed due to terrorism in the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been dismissed from their Cornwall Saltash apartment after numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple were forced to be removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company stated shocked that the apartment was in repair.
The walls had shooting holes, the floors were broken out, the rubbish was spread to the floors, and the walls were scratched with graffiti.
The couple are now changing, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Cornwall Housing Director Donna McEvoy says she is afraid that the apartment may not be saved anymore.
He says, "This has been a full nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to tolerate such.
There is a lot to consider, as the property is likely to be known not as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is a bad name, as its name is.”
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment from time to time, according to the police, the family's fearful power included street games on basketball stores, intimidation of neighbors, drug use and mediation, and loud screaming, disputes and curse.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the rental contract, received a decree on non-social behavior in June.
A number of rooms in the house were found with old waste.
The house had previously been sold drugs, and the floors were broken out.
The neighbors said the family was killed on the street and the police had to regularly call the site.
The Cornwall housing agency saved the couples forced this week after giving them the first 11 weeks of additional time to voluntarily switch off.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the wrath – they said their lives were a ground hell.
One of the neighbors said, “They didn’t care for anyone.
We have lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times.”
“Today morning we couldn’t sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet, we haven’t used to it!
It’s going to be great now that they’ve finally gotten out.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, Chairman of the Cornwall Housing Office for Compulsory Practices, said the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were called to the place regularly.
Clothes and old toys were thrown on the wild walls of the renthouse.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It’s a bad thing that the tenant has not taken any responsibility for his own and his family’s behavior, as the blasphemy is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This case was very difficult because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be shocking to look at the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the police and community members of Devon and Cornwall who participated in the work and offered courageously to give us information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of neighbors and give a message that non-social behavior is not accepted.”
Fitzpatrick says the family’s three sons had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already twenty.
In one bedroom of the house, a dirty patch was found.
Housing workers now have to clean out the house surrounded waste land.
In 2014, the police broke the apartment and found more than 70 grams of cannabis as well as vacas and other accessories as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was sentenced to a fine after being found guilty of possession of a class B drug in order to sell it.
He claimed that the money was for his son Lee Skeldon's grave, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been told to have moved to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were covered with graffiti.
The police said they demanded a blame to the tenants who are breaking the rules of the rental contracts.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall says this hunt serves as a clear warning to rentalers who are constantly threatening the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they want without accusations, as well as to those who have to suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never accept criminal and non-social behavior, and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beach-hyponut army shower scared tourists in Portugal
The sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in the Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed.
The air force said it was a training flight that did not threaten security.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were forced to escape when a low-flying shower dropped over the full beach.
The dramatic images show how the military aircraft arrives almost at a touch distance from the sunlighting tourists on the sandy shore in the northern Portuguese Aveiro.
The vacationers climbed up on their legs, clearly concerned about the jill of the shower motors, which began to sound before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the photographs and videos of the vacationers posted on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who tells: "It crossed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it seemed like it fell into the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the aircraft suddenly appeared and flighted at a stunning low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight intended to identify coastal fishing vessels, which was why the aircraft had to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly slightly lower than the usual because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires disrupted the visibility, but the air force said it did not threaten anyone's safety.
The forest fires have destroyed parts of the continental Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility caused by the smoke and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
The results of the first half of the year are better than expected.
The Social and Health Circle of South Carolina (Exote) made a thumb - in June 3.4 million euros from planned a better result.
The exotic outcome was 4.3 million euros in the first half of the year.
The outcome was good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dissolve institutional care.
Treatment is performed in all operations.
The project is aiming to shorten the measures this year.
Exot covers the surplus of the previously created deficit.
The remaining percentage may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The annual outcome is estimated to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
The exotic government will discuss a half-year review in its meeting on Wednesday.
70 Specialist border doctors swear to military wreck in Immol
A total of 70 guard officers of the Border and Maritime Guard School swore on Friday.
The military strike of the Border and Maritime Guard School was held in Immol on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Medical Course was held at the guard sports field.
He swears to 70 soldiers.
Special border doctors are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year there are 310 specialists.
250 of them were called for the trial.
Specialist border doctors have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting was attended by five veterans of the border forces during the war.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
Screenshots above - Criminal representation helps in the detection of crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police offices in Finland has since the beginning of 2014 operated a RTA (criminal reporting and analysis unit).
The activity of the unit is outwardly invisible.
The police department has a total of four police officers in Lahde and Hämeenlinn.
It is drawn by a placed overcontainers.
The Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Executive Officer.
In addition, the force of the unit belongs to a civil person dedicated to the information technology in Hämeenlinn.
Everyone works in civil society.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and necessity, says assistant police chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations to the other police.
It has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
The latest workplace reform
The establishment of the analysis units is the latest reform of the police working methods.
The goal was to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police would go more and less often to the place of the pill calls only when they get an alarm.
With the information collected and analyzed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most needed.
In conjunction with the reform of the police administration, one criminal investigation center was established in the country, with less than three state units and each police unit with its own criminal investigation unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in the context of the Central Criminal Police in Vanda, leads the activities nationally.
In the PTR units, people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard are working according to their name.
The RTA units, in turn, work in the areas distributed by police agencies, and their task is to provide information to both local police and state units.
The information extends beyond its territory.
Where the individual police is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour working hours, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police station area.
The information extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because it is the crime.
Those who work in the RTA unit have better ATK skills than the basic police.
The unit strives with the help of records, the alarm data base and the detections to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or one another-like crimes.
This is called a series, and it is one of the main tools for criminal investigation.
Everyone has its own way of acting.
The fingerprint is also visible in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
On the basis of the act, a specific image is formed from the factor.
The screening can be done either on the basis of what is done or on the basis of the person, depending on who the police have more information about.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk in the city with their necks straight, but their work is not completely public.
The methods used by both criminals and their own are not, as it could lead to the profession criminals to develop their activities and thus seek to prevent the police’s anti-criminal operations.
Police are informed publicly if they predict that they are threatened.
Such a case was, for example, from the beginning of the summer, the method of labelling empty apartments used in housing murders.
In that, the factors placed the outside door of the apartment with a pipe, a knop or a tape, with which they tried whether the inhabitants were really on the way.
The pre-examination material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The highest points are ordering a court protocol, which may, for example, show that the place has been found with fingerprints.
The next time the thieves go to the hand.
For this matter, the assistant police chief Tero Seppästä Hämeen of the police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola of the police of Eastern Finland, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärveä Joensuun of the police station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomelaa of the Central Criminal Police have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyze information that helps to plan practical activities.
Reducing the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended by the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information outside the Finnish border.
London school girl killed in Syria
According to the news, one of three British schoolchildren, Kadiza Sultana, who joined the Islamic State last year, has been killed in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer, told the girl’s family when she heard that the Sultan died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian attack on Raqqq, which is the ISIS base in Syria, ITV News Thursday.
The sultan was 17 years old and his family said he was just planning to escape from the war-out country and return to Britain.
"It's just hoping that this will serve as a warning example and a testament so that people will understand that this is a real risk when they go to the war zone - and that will lead people to give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other Eastern students, went on a Turkish plane and continued the journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that the Sultan had gone to Syria to marry an ISIS fighter and was widow only a few months after the marriages.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as Supreme Court judge if he is elected president.
The Senate's Republicans did not agree to confirm Garland's nomination after Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the next president will choose the person to take the place of the deceased Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a telephone conversation on Thursday that he predicts Clinton’s choice of Garland “with great certainty.”
Reid's spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton, whether he intended to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "shake the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid says the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the presidential candidates of Donald Trump's "heroes" and "depressants".
He says Trump is not in charge.
According to the Journal of Treats, naked calendar belongs equally to women and men.
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere and brings on the market a 1970s-style and Pirell-inspired calendar for 2017.
Instead of public stock models, they want to find the top models of the next generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his naked tweet differs from the old school Playboy, as he said: "Playboy is for men.
I’m doing this for women.”
I think the calendar is the same.
“We have to bring back the untemporary and classic nakedness in which women, wherever men are, can easily enjoy and be inspired by these glorious images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release from the calendar.
"Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful artwork."
Those who want to be a model in the calendar can send their photos via the network or participate in the open selection events held in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: who will buy the discs?
Solitary, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you get to write in a comment section your angry opposition with the label NoAllYellowMiddle AgedMen, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the research company YouGov, behind the new arrival of much spoken vinyl plates is not the millennial-generation boom, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead the background is medieval nostalgia.
The person who recently purchased a vinyl album is most likely between the ages of 45-54.
In fact, those belonging to the age group 18 to 24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of fans to break the discs, but the importance is emotional: older vinyl discs buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But do YouGov’s results be true?
If this blog was a television news broadcast, the camera would follow me while I walk along the vibrant Soho Street, wearing an untouched gray shirt. I would rise vibrantly, wrap my hand into a cup and say something of tradition, such as: "Let's get clear."
Let us make it clear.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and arrogance as the hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have dominated the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a lot of special disks stores.
I’d probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look for men who visit these stores very close and try to observe their age and quality of nature.
The 55-year-old Stuart from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (as a customer at the moment, two young women, three middle-age men) to Reckless Records (as a customer at the moment, eight middle-age men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip to London during the afternoon and spends their extra time exploring their stores.
I asked if he was a collector.
“I think I’m,” he says.
“I have about 3000 to 4,000 discs.”
These discs fill the walls of his living room, as shown on the picture. (Stuart sent the picture to me by email, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why she has acquired so many albums and singles is partially in her available income. She is now able to buy albums that she had not been able to afford when they appeared in her beginnings, and to buy again things that she had to sell when she was young and unpaid.
"I got a lot of things in the late 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own companions, and adds: "I don't burn, and I don't drink much.
It is my evil.”
Sister Ray’s 25-year-old Wez also believes that many of their customers fit with the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new kind of human flow, which has been influenced by media hypocrisy. These people have heard about the coming of vinyl disks again and now feel forced to buy their old disks back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people were usually abandoning their collections in places in 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyls back,” he says.
This can explain the boom of certain age vinyl spiders.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the audio discs?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, you will realize that they provide a comforting community for the same-minded types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been affected especially by the contactless payment system.
The digital world may hide some of the vinyllifans, for whom returning to the well-known discs means persistence and reminds of youth’s days of happiness.
"I think it sometimes fills some gap or material property is acquired for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
“I’ve seen it as a collector, and I think that’s the same as many others.
It’s an easy way to get your thoughts elsewhere.”
“We’re like social workers,” Wez’s job brother flies behind the plate.
A ICM study in April revealed that 50% of those who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to the album.
The opinion survey also said that 41 percent have a disc that they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl disc buyers don’t have their own disc at all.
At this stage of the news release, I would probably seem to be a serious narrow while browsing the brilliant bossa nova collection.
The new arrival of vinyl plates is also accompanied by a "pocaal phenomenon" that has been observed by the Sounds of the Universe movement (as a customer at the moment, three middle-age men) seller Jonny, 42.
"A customer recently came out and said he didn't have a discover, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so that he can put it on his plate," Jonny tells.
“The share of such customers is not large, but they still exist.
Materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don’t have a disorder yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers, who are just starting the hobby.”
The audience is much more variable in Fopp, which I get to the next. The movement has attributed a whole layer to the vinyl plates.
There are seven-year-old couples, photographers, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers excites, even if the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous moves: a soundtrack of a break-up jazz instead of Wild Beasts's newest sex-tinking synthesizer pop.
No one of the customers looks lonely, but a thick psychological trauma is difficult to detect by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppy for a few minutes and watched various discs on the discount.
He’s more looking at it than doing shopping.
He says his income is small, so it is not possible for him to collect discs.
“They will cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen from a computer or otherwise, but the fine of the vineyard is ...", he releases a delighted speech and continues:
“I can’t explain, they’re so unique.”
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a series of teenage girls who would imagine jumping on the fark-sorts but who instead gather around the Polaroid cameras for a moment. I see a father and daughter who are thinking about buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's discs: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, key discs for any medium collection.
No one looks at the wall, because they are just as an interior element and part so high that they are not even overcome.
They are pure "art vinyl" injection.
But considering that all the ways to get attention to these discs may mean more money to the industry and send a few customers for a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population group with the most probability of having more time and money than the most is also the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although, on the basis of my research, the results of YouGov are true, at least in Savo disks, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyllifans that are actually present in both disks and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely stuck in school or work.
They will not spend their Thursday morning painting on the Berwick Street discs, browsing discs, and avoiding a 30-year-old TV player who looks scary and glides unconscious middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living backbone – video report
According to scientists, the longest living backbone on Earth is a ice hole.
According to Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice age in the study was 272-512 years old.
French court rejects petition for dissolving five-collar shops
A French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request that dozens of temporary shops and restaurants be dismantled in a five-college with thousands of refugees.
The Calais authorities submitted in the trial held this week claims that the state should have permission to dissolve 72 temporary shops established in the refugee camp. The shops sell to the residents of the refugee camp different goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer hair cuts. From temporary restaurants you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic foods for a few euros.
According to the Calais prefecture authorities, these stores and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and thus represent a grey economy and because they are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp because the free meals offered by the state-backed organization and other entities are not enough for the growing crowd of the camp.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need them.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal grounds for the expulsion of 72 temporary dealers, but considered the concerns of the Calais prefect "fullly understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said the food stores, cafés and restaurants in the camp have much greater importance than just providing food to people who “live in extreme unstable conditions.”
He says they will provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the threat of dismantling was the camp's Jungle Book Kids Cafe, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals per day, English and French hours and asylum counsel for the camp's hundreds of unemployed minors with the most vulnerable status.
More than 170,000 people have signed the address where the children’s cafe is required to be stored.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, its closure "will be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that after the sharp increase in the summer inhabitants, the population of the five colours has risen to a record, over 9,000 people.
Food prices fall faster than the average in the EU
Food in Finland is drastically reduced for the joy of consumers and for the harm of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by five percent in three years, while the average price in EU countries has fallen by 0.9 percent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
In the last three years, food prices have fallen in Finland to the second most in the EU countries with the same salary level as in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information comes from the statistics center’s development director Ilkka Lehtisen’s writing, which was published on the info & trends blog.
The newspaper compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food increased drastically.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We are close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is burdened by the prohibitions imposed by Russia on food imports, which have disrupted food shipping from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The sharp price competition between industry and trade has also influenced the price decline.
The big trade chains of the S-Group and Central have both dropped their prices.
For the consumer, the price competition has been shown as prominent advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is not yet a stool of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen abundantly.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive in the EU with the same salary level as in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the net countries had the same VAT percentage, the third cheapest food from the same countries would be sold in Finland.
The newspaper translated Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven, only the Germans and the Netherlands would sell food cheaper than the Finnish.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, we need to halve the VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
The newspaper notes that his calculations on the VAT percentage are orientative.
The school is no longer the same.
If you go back to the school, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools has been prepared, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
This is the guidance that all schools in Finland are operating.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New instructions have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old in many ways.
In other words, the teaching of beauty writing is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
The school starts at 6th grade and the school starts at 4th grade.
The major change, however, concerns the role of students.
It was previously thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone must be active and learn from each other.
In this way, we try to make the school more interesting.
The world's longest backbone is found - ice hole can live up to 400 years
Also known as the glacier, the Somniosus microcephalus only reaches genocide at the age of 150.
It can live after 250 years, a new study reports.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in today's world.
In the animal community it is only passed by an Icelandic flock, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenland flows along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The rabbits stretch the dogs longer, they can grow even more than five centimeters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to surveys only about a centimeter per year, adults have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen with his colleagues made it clear.
He identified adult ice hills from 28 hills that had remained in the fishing of the fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio-carboning of the glasses.
The average age of the whales studied was at least 272 years.
The two greatest fish in the vacuum, the 493 and 502 cent amatsonian frogs, were discovered at the age of about 335 and 392.
Since previous studies have found that ice cranes only reach more than four meters of relativity, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann's withdrawals to almost 300 - sellers are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees will be dismissed from Stockmann.
The co-operation companies in the difficult company ended in early August.
“As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be dismissed,” Stockmann said in a statement.
According to this, the number of sellers in the warehouses will not be reduced so that the customer service will not suffer.
Moreover, approximately 80 employees in support operations will be offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann’s YT negotiations concerned about 3,000 employees.
It was estimated that there were approximately 380 employees.
The reduction aimed at an annual cost savings of approximately 20 million euros, which are expected to be achieved in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency program, which is intended to a savings of €50 million this year.
The background is the difficulties of Stockmann to get profitable from the trade in goods.
Although the group's refined turnover improved in the second quarter to €11.1 million, the goods store still makes losses.
The CEO of Stockmann, Lauri Veijalaisen, said the sales in the warehouses have not exceeded the goals set by the company.
“People’s reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive turnover of Stockmann Retail in 2018,” Veijalainen said in a statement.
On the background of the result improvement in the second quarter was especially the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved the best of all time in the second quarter with its turnover and outcomes.
Lindex’s business profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s turnover was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the company’s turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The refined turnover is expected to be somewhat positive this year.
Friday is the most rainy in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure center on the north of Finland keeps the weather rain on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rainfall in the middle of the country, but in the south there is pouta.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as the whole country remains below 20 degrees Celsius.
In the rainy regions of the north, it remains at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's general sports team is scattered by doping scandal - a strange explanation for coach's temptation
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP that the athlete in which Anzrah tried to appear was the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenian national team, said the identity of Anzrahi was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprising test.
Doping operators were presented to the Anzrahi authorities.
Soin said Anzrah was sent home because he "covered his crime against the Kenian national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We can’t accept such a behavior,” Kenian Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The general Olympics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the rider is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich ranked fourth in the World Cup last year and is ahead of Rio’s winner.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenian general sports team, in turn, claimed that Anzrah passed with an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the gambling village.
When antidoping worker met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to be revealed," the source said.
Where are they all?
Rio's sports stadium is empty.
Where are they all right?
Not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
The struggle for the medals of general sports began in Rio on Friday, but the world's top clubs were able to show their skills to a confusing empty view.
Rion organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day breakfast tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets were sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulled by a hurrying crowd.
Tickets for the final in Rio are already sold.
The Rion Olympics has already attracted attention before the public sports.
For example, in the sights of rugby, melon and riding has seen thousands of empty spots.
When Brazilian medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the view was filled.
After the Brazilian duel, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30% of the 12,000 views were filled.
Bad excursions are explained at least by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian sports tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to the Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
Nevertheless, even the first match of the Brazilian football team didn’t get the football stadium full.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the match organizers, said this weekend that the tickets were sold at the time by 82 percent, a clearly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to be sold," Andrada said to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million London Olympics tickets, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost half more than in Rio.
Ticket prices in Rio have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets are less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet permitted because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
The organizers in Rio have given 240,000 tickets to school students in the country for less-known species such as golf and rugby.
In the morning there were empty places.
Even the beach ball on Copacaba's sand has not been interested in the public.
The competition was held in London in 2012.
People in newspapers are enough.
A New Way to Protect Nature – Get Right to Land Area
The Helsinki Foundation is contributing to the protection of nature by new means.
The Foundation, which was founded last year, will acquire ecologically important natural areas to its ownership.
After that, individuals, enterprises and entities can rescue the ownership of the land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land from Lap.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks, which the desirable can acquire for the payment of ownership.
The holder receives a veto right to his block of 187 square meters, which in practice means that no approval from each holder is required if the purpose of the land is intended to be changed.
Property rights can also be obtained to multiple blocks.
The acquisition of administrative authority is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go carrying banderols or catch yourself somewhere to protect nature,” Joha Leviäkangas, who acquired the management right for his company, justifies.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives accurate location information from his block, allowing for example a visit to the block.
On the foundation’s website, the name details of the acquisition of ownership rights are compiled on the same map from which the block details of the land area are found.
Leviäkangas sees its natural protection procurement as a risk only by the fact that the foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a public benefit foundation aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect natural areas in such a way that they can be intact and quiet.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly by selling ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founder.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protective countries.
It also targets outside the Finnish border and plans to acquire immigrants from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce on 13-19 August.
Bicycle thieves torture the worst of the big cities in Turku - see the situation in your home town
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the worst of Finnish major cities.
This year there have been more rounds stolen compared to the number of inhabitants in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the cycling theft to the police, Helsingin Sanomat how many bicycles and their parts were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year, counted per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turkey, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the top.
According to the police, there were four to five cycling cases per thousand inhabitants.
In Espo and Kouva, the police were only about two cycling theft per thousand inhabitants.
That is the big difference.
“In other cities, the number of theft is proportional to the number of inhabitants compared to others,” says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the Police Administration.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It’s extremely difficult to say why more wheels are stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The frequency of the theft can be affected by how much cyclists are moving in the city and how many wheels there are at all," thinks the supercontroller Teemu Äikäs.
Police department Tommi Reen says it is quite anticipated that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of cycling theft goes largely depending on what are the study and cycling cities.
The market has a close center, short distances and a lot of wheels available to the thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different type of city, where the city centers are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of movement,” Reen says.
According to the police, there have been a little less cycling cases in January-August compared to the same period last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decrease in recent years, the police are informed about a little more than 20,000 cycling robbery per year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bicycles per year.
“These are large amounts,” Reen says.
In fact, the thieves take more rounds, as only a few of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on the people to make a criminal report on cycling theft, although less than every ten cases to the police survive.
A typical detected bicycle theft is one in which the police get information about theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
“These cases will also be resolved in the context of other investigations, when, for example, in a drug displacement, stolen wheels can be found in an apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cycling thieves are arrested weekly for their own work or in the context of a police investigation, says the senior counterpart Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, the wheels are stolen, for example, from the wheels of the shopping centers, the inside shelves, the warehouses and the wheels of the wheels, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
Most of the individual wheels are stolen, as in previous years, Jopoja.
The U lock provides a better protection to the bicycle than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bicycles ends in sale, for example via the internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
“Not yet the police have come to the knowledge that the stolen wheels will almost go abroad,” Reen says.
The buyers of the stolen wheels, according to the police, are ordinary Finns.
Some people will buy a stolen bicycle without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bicycle must be careful, as he may be guilty of a hiding or infringement.
“The alarm clocks should be called if a good-conditioned bicycle is sold at a clear low price,” Reen says.
Special library officer Severi Hirvi carries the colour Nopsa all the time of his working day to the protectors of the Kallion library in Helsinki.
He has had five pieces of wheels, but no one has been stolen, says the Monkey. ”He has never been taken, there has been a good monk.”
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there's not necessarily a hipster value here," the Helsinki Monkey thinks.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio in Helsinki, closed his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bicycle drops to the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks its bicycle into something fixed, such as a wheelchair.
“There’s a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own,” the Helsinki student says about his white bicycle, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
“All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken.”
“To avoid bad rounds, such spiders.”
A motorcycle was stolen from the house house a year ago.
The bicycle was unlocked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be found.
Children under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki tests U.S.-known counterfeit crews
In Helsinki, we are testing the so-called counterfeit crew to prevent young people from entering a criminal streak.
Initially, the trial applies to children under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
This is the first crime committed by the young man.
The idea is that the counterfeit team discusses the incident with the criminal and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the criminal may join the counterfeit staff to refund his act.
Other consequences can be, for example, a letter to the family, which explains what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
We also have other modes of mediation that are used in parallel.
“Everyone guides the youth’s activity in a more responsible direction so that everyone doesn’t break the first mistake,” Laitio says.
It has been adopted a model from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young man does not fall in front of the adult panel, but reflects what has happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service director at Palmua, who followed the experiment, said it was a misconduct that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have previously been treated at all.
“It’s been a message that you’re going on the way you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
It is part of the Immigrants’ Helsinki project, which is based on the Helsinki City and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasizes that new approaches will be offered to all those in need, not just to the immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, the open letter was addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The subscribers want the party’s money to be transferred to Congress instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his indifference, disqualification and record disadvantage threaten to bring voting to the Democrats in these elections,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-covered anchor in their neck.
The letter says the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organized persons in the letter is apparently opponent to Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politicon, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "the people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump’s actions that are believed to have inflicted millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have demonstrated dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. children
In the U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told the details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am seeking to be president so that the U.S. economy goes well for everyone.
“Donald Trump seeks to become president so that the economy goes well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a speech.
The center of Clinton’s plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve the U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly funded by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The building program is a hand cleansing for American duunars who suffer from factory shifts to cheap labour countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We’re building, we’re building again.
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working children’s families.
On Thursday, Sanders said that wealthy people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. as a tax refuge, it will have to pay the exit tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As [President] I am against any trade agreements that act against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the Washington Post's speculation published before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the Republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday because it "admired just these kinds of millionaries."
Trump’s proposed royalty to lower corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called “Trump’s bourgeoisie.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded listeners of the small whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start making the products himself in America,” Clinton said.
This is Rion’s viewers: The matches have not attached the Finnish to the roofs, but the mobile app is interested
Typically, sports pads appear in TV viewers statistics as sharp mountains.
The Olympics in Rio have not yet reached the highest number of viewers.
At the same time, the matches have clinged to the roofs at the best of 12 percent of the population: Tuesday evening swimming was followed by Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time by 615,000 viewers.
For comparison: a month ago, the general sports EM championship received almost 800,000 viewers at a time on TV2, and the football EM championship just another million.
The most of the Olympics have so far been interested by Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day opened tennis training, which both reached the Olympic channel almost half a million viewers at a time.
General sports manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the viewers, and reminds that the viewers are divided at the Rio Olympics for the first time in several different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finnish players are watching the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much TV viewers in general choose the Olympics.
On the TV side, the viewers are distributed to TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympics in Rio are the first sports clubs to be held by Yle.
If the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the entire time of viewing is from 20,000 to 500,000, then it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained by the time difference – a large part of Rio’s match broadcasts come in Finland at night.
A second reason for a lazy interest – if it is now one who considers it a lazy – is a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprising medal from the first round, the interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, the general sport is just starting, just like other species of Finnish interest: swimming and riding.
The number of viewers was close to what was expected.
When the sport starts, the spectators explode.
Yle launched for the matches the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which appeared in the first days of the matches in the Apple App Store as the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application was downloaded 150,000 times.
I’m sure we’re going to have 200,000 downloads.
“We will only get the web viewers later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users hopefully.
It says the feedback has arrived and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other small technical problems in the early stages.
There are updated versions of the applications that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics appear on the Channel and Arena of Yale more broad than any other sporting event ever before.
The General Fem channel can be followed by some species, and the General Speech radio broadcasts matches daily.
The Olympics are not only the most busy for Yule ever, but also the last that can only be followed by Yule channels.
As of 2018, the Olympic Games will be broadcast on both Top and Commercial Channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijän, with a depth of 95.3 meters on the Cross Island.
It may be even deeper.
Technical assistant educator Matti Kannela found a pressure of about 20 square meters from the Cross, with a submarine computer displaying a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Center tried in vain to strengthen the observation by all-saving.
The method may not necessarily find a small depth of a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far the official depth remains 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 meters range from Saimaa, Toisvesi and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as thoroughly as the Lightning.
In particular, the basement of the Inari Lake is not accurately maped.
“There could be an unknown depth,” Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the average, it is the Great Jukajjärvi, 23 meters.
With this view, your Day will not reach the top ten, and the Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 14.29: The last paragraph was corrected, in which the deepest lakes of their middle depth were wrong.
Taxation: Pension taxation increases
The taxation of pensioners is still more rigorous than the taxation of payers.
It says that the disadvantage arose during the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to payers.
This is not included in the Government’s proposal.
We think that should definitely be there.
The promises made should be fulfilled after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, the employers received reductions on income, which reduced the taxation.
The matter warmed in the parliament representatives of the opposition, who blamed the promises of the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbia.
The purchasing power is saved, it does not grow.
According to the Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpon, the issue of tax cuts is mainly to safeguard the purchasing power and not to increase, since the wages will not be raised next year.
He says that tax reduction positively affects purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Idea is pleased with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central) and Orpo on the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement achieved through effort.
He says that keeping the agreement up is important for reliability.
It is the main economic and employment policy of the government.
It is done by the power of the labour market organizations, so it should not be overwhelmed by questioning.
It comes into need because the economy is so much in the midst of domestic demand and people’s own future faith.
Long-term unemployment in the UK
It calls on the government that it should take over long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed in June was approximately 17,000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if the growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will disappear.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the permit.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims in the attack in Thailand
At least four people were killed in a bomb attack in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy calls on the Finnish citizens to be careful and avoid the most busy tourist areas and follow the guidelines of the authorities.
Finish tourists who are scheduled to travel to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's guidelines should be followed with caution, Westphalen says.
There are very few Finns in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand, although the exact number of them is difficult to estimate.
The Thai tour is scheduled for the end of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish citizens in Thailand via Facebook after the bombing.
The embassy has tried to target the Finns in Hua Hinis in particular to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contact persons in Hua Hin are currently away from the city.
In general, everything seems to be good, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen says there is no information about the cause of the attack.
The ambassador believes that the events may be associated with the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and the last week’s referendum on the constitution drawn up by the military forces.
The law was approved in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among others, people were arrested who claimed to be opposed to the law.
In the southern provinces of Thailand there is an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist attractions.
Today is a great, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
She says that the city is celebrating the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very accurate about security.
Police in Thailand: It is not international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, the Thai police news agency AP said.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including tourists’ favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination in Phuket, four bombs exploded in the night, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not demand victims.
Two of the bombs exploded on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ng, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded at the recommended tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one of the two bombs died.
In South Thailand, in the village of Surat Than and in the town of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is transported to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao's holiday islands.
The cause of the attack is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, head of the Thai military, said the attack was unknown.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don’t want to let people panic anymore, he told reporters.
Security Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist sites.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the Finnish citizens to be careful and avoid the most busy tourist areas and follow the guidelines of the authorities.
Financers who are planning to travel to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the guidelines of the Embassy should be followed with caution, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
Until now, very little is known about the attacks that occurred during the night in Finland.
There is a little more information about the attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the injured are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last Hua Hin attack.
Two bombs exploded at the headquarters of the clock tower.
The Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, where it believes they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb, according to the province's governor, was hidden in a flower box.
A local employee was killed in the attack.
There are at least one injured.
A police chief told CNN that two bombs exploded every half an hour during the attack on Surat Than.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two police stations.
U.S. Biles Wins Women's Quartet
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with a score of 60,098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was third with a score of 58,665 points.
Biles, 18 years old, is still struggling to play in the Rion matches with permano, jumping and throwing.
Biles has managed women’s gym in a mental degree over the past few years.
He has won eight personal world championships.
He has won the semi-playing and permano championships three times in a row, as well as in the past and another year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two team competitions world championships.
The more cool MM metals in Biles have jumping and trees.
Thailand’s Finnish entrepreneur: “Islam has no impact on tourism”
In Phuket, Thailand, Esa Huovila, who runs a property mediation office and a children's playground in the same property, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombing attacks on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, then I don’t think there will be anything more miraculous about this, according to the Finnish entrepreneur Huovila, who has worked in Asia for about two decades.
Experienced entrepreneur has seen from close many tragedies experienced in Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these previously have not deported tourists, then hardly that too.
The company’s office is located a few hundred meters away from the explosion site.
He heard the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says both the beach and the main road of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the taxes were placed for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's feast in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was quiet and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach had not heard of the attack.
Half three hours a day in the Thai time at Patong, traffic was normalized and a large portion of stores had opened their doors.
The explosion was quite small, according to the police.
The car was later seen at the Jouxholminti.
When the police arrived, the car was burned.
The party found two men fit to the signs hidden in a close sixth place.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other man fled, but the man was later found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and severe damage.
The police are grateful for the clues.
Research Director on the Change of Leadership in Russia: Clear Departure
In Russia, the highest-value leadership change was made on Friday after President Vladimir Putin dismissed his head of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov is the 44-year-old Estonian Anton Vaino.
He was an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's double man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent the strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He added that recycling of leadership positions is one way of power use.
This is a way to prevent people from gathering the president-independent power for themselves.
According to Kangaspur, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught up with other managers or mocked.
Resignation to Ivanov
Ivanov, who belongs to Putin's internal circle, is transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport affairs.
In a press release, Putin said the change was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested transfer to other duties and proposed persecution in his place, Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view it is a clear decline in position.
Environment and transport are not very important in Russia.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a major role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential follower of Putin in 2008, but the president was Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro notes that the old cards, for example governors, have been exchanged in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than Ivanov's place's heir is that Putin changes his neighborhood to younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human beings to withdraw from Syria
They used civilians as humans when they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we didn’t target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish militants captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij.
According to estimates, dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected from the previous news at 19:30: We previously wrongly said that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the publication of documents is illegal, says public law professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that the publicity of the document cannot be based on the authority’s own guidelines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior has previously refused to disclose the list of participants of the Ministry of the Interior's opportunities to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the State Council's chancellor and with the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry’s communication director tells the STT that the ministry has a significant need to reform the practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the values.
He broke his back from the beginning of the season and was forced to leave the Jamaican Olympic Championships.
This wasn’t a perfect preparation, but I’m much better.
I’ve practiced well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
This press conference included low-covered sambat dancers and fan-made journalists.
Porina Bolt tells the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era in which public sports have fought with doping scandals and bone marrow interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in 2004 in Athens, where he climbed 200 meters in a time of 21,05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his domination began at a hundred meters, by which he broke the world record and the competitors’ self-confidence, despite the final celebration in the time of the birth of 9,69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt achieved his career with a clock measurement.
The world record in Berlin at 9.58 meters and 19.19 meters is still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that it will pursue a 200-meter world record and a 19-second underground, but no one believes it will be born except Bolt himself.
Bolt's biggest challenge is the 2004 Athens 100 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
In the last year's World Cup in Beijing, Bolt dropped the American in just one hundred seconds.
Bolt has not been in Beijing during the beginning of his reign and has not lost the values in the final even once, if he has just reached the journey.
During the 2011 World Cup in Daegua, Bolt failed to run because of a scam.
Bolt will complete a lot of a week after 30.
He is an old man in the young men's genre, and the Rion matches are his last Olympics.
Bolt is the last player to play the World Cup next year in London.
These are the Olympics that distinguish me from others.
I’m older and it’s more difficult.
But every time I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Previous Post:Two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhuan, the 18-year-old Chinese martyr Chen Xinyi has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
In the doping sample of Chen Xiny, a Chinese murderer, found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian shooter Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan general sports coach was passed home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
She ranked fourth in the 100 meters female race in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese murderer has brought his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sports (CAS).
Xinhua reports that Xiny's sample on Sunday had found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are other doping attacks in Rio.
The Bulgarian female shooter Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya has passed a sports coach home from Rio for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had become an athlete in a test case and had given a doping sample for it.
According to the media, it is the Kenyan fast-speed coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre rider Ferguson Rothic's basketball pass.
Phelps doesn't stop anything - historic gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics, the U.S. Michael Phelps swim in 200 meters mixed in his 22nd Olympic win in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic balls.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the Olympic Cup in four consecutive matches.
Phelps' time of victory was 1.54.66.
Japanese Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in the mixture before Chinese Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to keep a little fun, BBC's Olympic counterpart Helen Skelton laughs in a brief interview with Iltaleht.
The story made on Monday on Helen Skelton is the most read this week on the Webpage.
The commentator is Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t get a lot of stress if there’s a little bit of his revealing and special houses in the Somes or the British newspaper.
The TV is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton has been dressed in high-range shoes and a short-range dress that will have at least sufficient exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
Backpacks are not permitted.
It’s important to look good, and small potatoes are just a fun thing.
Skelton is sure he wants to get rid of and to get troubled, but he emphasizes he doesn’t want to be in the main role.
This is not about me, he says.
Here we are looking at the sport, and focus must be on the athletes.
It doesn’t matter how I’m dressing.
Can you imagine that the storm has surpassed Finland?
I can’t, but everything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers do the work and how big sacrifices they do, is okay for me.
Do you know what?
It is a shade of empty if it comes from clothes.
I’m a little worried if someone has found it.
Rion police arrest two people for terror suspicion
Rion police said on Thursday that it has arrested two people for suspicion of terrorism.
The police arrested in connection with the security control of the matches.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and interrogated two persons before their release.
All the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that the police arrested in July.
The detainees are believed to have connections with the ISIS.
The prisoners were allegedly caused violence on social media.

Argentine woman dressed Petäjä-Sirena - Finnish man thought of protest
The wind at Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind was hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady dressed Windy Petäjä-Sirena on Thursday in Rio on the opening of the Women's Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He was killed because of the collar, and the others fled, said Finnish coach Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete has long considered the protest.
It was not worth it because it would have been unnecessary according to the Olympic rules.
I had to fall into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finnish fell to his table until the last, because he did not want to fall into the dirty water of Rio.
At the end of the day, the Finnish man left the 27th place.
The London Olympic Championship 2012 is the eighth.
The collapse has not affected much.
Friday is an important day when there is a battle outlets 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, extend your age
Science has studied everything between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person's life.
Some of the things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his life is extended.
Sometimes, things that a person can’t affect himself can bring him additional years.
These include, among other things, a tendency to a middle-income or a social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don’t always need to get stuck – just seeking milk is enough.
The secret of long age has been sought to be revealed by many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange results of the study.
According to science, all of these things could bring more years of life.
Drinking potato and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect some from cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "reduced risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or heart disease.
For the sake of alcohol, research shows that moderate consumption – one to three daily doses – can extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinks lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of a toothbrush can extend a person’s life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
They can also contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway revealed how laughter affected the life of a person.
The project, which lasted seven years, attended more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the test ended.
Sex, when protection against sexual diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
It can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
In order for a person to get more years in his life, he also needs to get an orgasm.
Exercise takes more years and it is not to be denied.
However, achieving a long age does not require unconditional cellularity.
One study from the University of Oxford found that women with a big back had lower cholesterol levels.
Their bodies also contained more omega-3 fatty acids.
The same study combined these facts with lower mortality.
Whether it’s an athlete who reached the Olympic medals or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than the usual bottle.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings additional years to his life.
Some researchers suspect that the long age is due to a person’s social status – which, by its own contribution, enables the search for recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study on the shopping behavior of people over the age of 65 found that people who shop daily, or less likely to make shopping, become older.
This is due to the fact that rotating in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has also been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may anticipate death.
So count your credit card from your hand - therefore, the online trading does not have the same effect.
A riding truck shooter crashed into a truck.
On Friday night there was a serious shock of a truck and a person's car.
The accident occurred in Koskella, between Koskentien and Sorvastontien on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forsa, when the passenger car that had arrived had moved on the same thread, hit the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained on the roof after the collision, but burned up.
The driver managed to turn off the fire himself.
The car crashed on the roof and from there on the roof.
A woman born in 1972, who carried a personal car, was stuck in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to the University Central Hospital of Turun for treatment.
The result of the female swelling test was 2.02 promille.
He is suspected of drunk drunk.
Posts sending people to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket's discharge options because the mail had accidentally delivered a part of the cargo to the Wall Street.
Teija Haltia, who lived in Perniya, was on Thursday buying vacancies from the Salon K-Citymarket, when a fun blade hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are defects in the packaging, because the Post delivered our load to the Wall!
We will receive more when the mail is delivered!
If you don’t put it in the shell, read it in the shell.
The shopper's catch-leaning side is associated with the fact that the Post extended its services last spring to also touch the grass cutting.
It will always be available to the Post until the end of August.
Haltian said the sand was mostly fun and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in the storm.
The media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention to this matter is incredible, Haltia wonder.
On Friday afternoon, the Haltia update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favourites in a vacuum bag, although a few laars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Post Corporate Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five scenes were misleading yesterday in the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we were no longer going to do a part delivery (Saloon) with three, but we took only five scenes today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This was the first afternoon news.
Teja Haltia didn’t get angry with the sand because she found all of her own discharge pockets in the selection.

Wish of the family of the murdered woman in Loviisa: victim memories for police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago hoped that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by a donation for police dogs.
The Zoo Veterinary Department has published a Facebook update in which it communicates the victim's family's wishes for donations to the police dogs.
In the publication it is that the victim had worked as a locator at the Zoo Veterinary Department and also completed his nursing training there.
The veterinarian address reminds the woman with touching words.
Pleasant, intelligent, humorous and work without fear.
A good friend.
However, we cannot fully understand that he is missing.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
In the update it is stated that the donation funds all go to police dogs, primarily to the procurement of security guests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviis woman was murdered in her own home in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The victims said the victim was very animal-friendly.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, cows and flowers.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer was traced by a police dog Börje, who was injured in a life-threatening arrest.
But Bourgeois has survived and is recovering.
Court of Appeal sentenced Post for violation of Equality Act
Post was not entitled to retain the salary of the employee who refused to withdraw a rental worker, the Court of Appeal of Kanta-Häme assesses in its judgment.
The Court of Appeal obliged Post to pay the majority of the employee’s arrested salary and €2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Post would have been able to withdraw from the remuneration of the perpetrator only the part that corresponded to the perpetrator’s share of the whole day’s work.
In violation of the Equality Act, the employee was placed in a disadvantage status on the basis of his association activity.
The employee had followed the Postal and Logistics Union’s PAU Organizational Decree on the Displacement Prohibition.
In November last year, the PAU made a decision that the Post’s employees do not reject the strike-breaking rental workers.
This was first by the People's News.

Putin resigns head of government - replaces Estonian deputy Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He is the son of the Soviet Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
It is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been the Vice-Chairman of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The victim will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax said.
Vladimir Putin has dismissed his head of government.
According to the Kremlin, Ivanov, who belongs to Putin’s close internal circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport affairs.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested transfer to other duties and proposed persecution in his place, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB spy.
Many regarded Ivanov as a possible follower of Putin in 2008, but the president became Dmitry Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's resignation to the game ban - not seen at the opening of the Vali League
The world record player of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English League will be removed to the end of the weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from playing in England.
Manchester United's reserve acquisition Paul Pogba is on the side due to a game ban when the ManU opens its match against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba 105 million euros to the Italian team, according to British media.
However, the English Football Federation (FA) keeps him away from the game, as Pogbal was burdened by Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a single game prohibition.
The game ban has been transferred to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next goal to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU faces Southampton.
Flow’s size is good.
The accurate criteria for entertainment and ambitious visions have established the status of the Flow Festival as an internationally respected event celebrated by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
The festival guests typically express themselves in their own clothes.
One of the main artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is styled, among other things, by workshops and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to be just the headline and the fishing team, says the event’s artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will be held this weekend in Helsinki Suvilah, has grown from a small card festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
On the background of success, there is a simple question: to what event would the factors themselves want to go?
It is quite different in the event that we think that way.
Often the goal is to the level of necessity and to act in accordance with authority orders, says the event’s artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out this year.
The aim was to increase the number of visitors of 70,000 people by 5,000 last year.
This year, there will be a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The growth of the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a sheep, which is directed on huge trails.
That we don’t want.
The ideology of the successful event has been expanded over the course of 13 years in such a way that in the part-to-the-country area there are 130 performers, art facilities and numerous restaurants and drinking bars.
In addition to the headboard and the smaller showboards, this year a telt of 15,000 people will be held as the place of the castle.
He added that the event could be made easier.
Maybe I’m a little big bull, but at the same time we’ve been able to preserve Flow’s spirit.
If we lose it, this is no longer our matter.
To Kalli, the greatest pleasure and reward for the work done is that even today great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the middle of the 21st century, the activity was very dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of Flow’s stock company was about 6 million euros.
It can make “cruise things” like the construction of that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves in self-dressed clothes.
In addition to the music event, we can also talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as fashionable.
We want to distinguish it first and foremost by content.
Nevertheless, fashion phenomena also match Flow’s world of values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is the punk legend, the 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but not in the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul, he has the most typical performers.
According to Kallion, Iggy was bucked, because now it is probably the last time that this is seen on a peak in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what is broadcast on commercial radio.
Iggy's last disc is a good hame and he has made a good hame in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flowers - tourists fled in fear
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower coat and exploded with mobile devices.
The bombs were placed on the street, the majority of whose customers are foreigners.
They exploded at the same time that tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Since 1989, the wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who has lived in Asia, quotes a much speaking picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn’t look properly, you can look at it here.
At least 11 of the injured were foreign tourists.
A crowd rushed to me and said the bomb exploded near the bar.
It happened at one of the biggest bar roads, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Soon after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one is clearly dead.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
One bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to Thai authorities, behind the bombings are likely rebels who are not satisfied with the actions of Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently engaged in the activities of human trafficking criminals.
KSML: This part of the new preparation groups starts fighting in a war situation
In an acute war situation, the security officers are ordered to take the battle missions only a few months after the prison of the military law, the Central Committee said.
According to the newspaper’s interview with the Defence Forces training chief, Prikaatinkraal Jukka Sonnisen, for example, of the 5.5 months serving equipment men in a war situation are combatable only those who are in the final stage of their training.
According to the training manager, the reserves belonging to the preparation teams are first assigned to the service.
No security officer or reserve officer is ordered for a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin to train the security personnel in the units of immediate preparation from next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during the training of the armor.
Pamela Tola receives remuneration for hometals
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a lot of dispute about the apartment they bought from Espo in 2009.
The trade price of the two-storey separate house was 330,000 euros.
After the trade, however, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused a dangerous microbial plantation to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to €132,000, so the financial losses to Tol and Waroma amounted to €198,000.
The couple brought the case to the court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the court and the court.
The court issued a judgment on Wednesday.
It kept in force a judgment of the Court of Appeal, which ordered the seller to pay to Tol and Waroma 150,000 euros of price discount.
In addition, the seller is obliged to compensate the court and investigation costs of the couple for a total of €47,344.
The right of reasonable price reduction was slightly because some of the need for repair of the apartment had been known to the buyers already when the apartment sale was made.
According to the court, the errors were significantly more serious than the errors were presented.
Looking for a good home.
Tola told the court that the couple had precisely sought a well-established home because they didn’t want to start repairs.
He had the idea that the building was basicly renovated and in good condition and that there is no harm to the facts mentioned in the fitness inspection report.
The municipal inspection report indicated the risks and inappropriate ventilation and the fact that the management of the rainwater and sulphur waters along the roof is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not show that it would be an urgent issue.
Tola and Waroma remained in the idea that rainwater from the rocks should be somewhat directed in a few years.
The sale was made in October 2009.
Within a few years it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In the inspections conducted in 2012 and 2013, the building found microbial growth, which, according to witnesses, was due both to the rainwater of the canyon and to the capillary-rise land.
On the west side of the house, the air polluted by microbes, according to the inspector’s estimates, allowed it to enter the interior through the cube.
A health-risking, cross-border foam or slurry was found in slurry samples in the housing room, the elevator staircase, the living room window markers, and the elevator washroom.
It was built without permission.
The court also disputed whether the apartment was extended in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware before the trade of the decision of the city of Espoo, according to which the apartment had been modified contrary to the permission.
For example, the terrace was built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
Homosexual issues were a key issue in the court.
According to the law, the buyers could, on the basis of the data they received from the seller before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for large repairs in the near future.
Tolalla and Waroma did not have a particular reason to do a broader inspection than the usual.
The buyers have not neglected their obligation to subsidize, the court states in their judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - also Finnish
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent Dagens Nyheter article how the National Archive in Maryland, the United States, has recorded microfilms of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of the women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
Moreover, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi Morsiam.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German Racial Agency.
The rabbit agency operated under the head of the SS Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by a SS doctor.
The same applies to even greater amounts of women who had to be able to raise up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergoing gynecological trials to find out the case.
The Rainbow Agency investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by examining church books.
It was intended to ensure that there were no Jews in women’s sex.
Women should also be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Agency hand-written life stories and good recommendations from their loved ones.
The rabbit agency wanted guarantees that women were “childdogs”, “saving women” and “good national socialists” who knew well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-backed program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program, among other things, prescribed that each SS man should have four children, whether in marriage or outside it.
Lebensborn houses take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the program has not been promoted very actively, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum's pages.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage spending by offering loans and supporting children.
The German mother's honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Arabs" and "non-Arabs" were prohibited by law, the museum's pages say.
At the sixth time, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko was ranked third in the flight in the first departure of the Finnjolli Day at the Rio Olympics, but remained the whole group in the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose to the eighth in the overall position after five leaks, but the failure of the second leaks dropped him to the 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought RS:X-class day in the departure places 17 and three.
In the general situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In 470s, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained on the 23th place in the day's opening.
In total, Lindgren is on the 19th place.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so in a cloth"
Jari Sillanpää has been among the Finnish favourite artists for more than 20 years.
From the bar of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, to the best-selling solo artist of Finland and to the star of the dances and festivals, Sillanpää is able to brush further and he is currently in a hurry lift.
A book written by Mari Koppisen, a book about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells him about his life and his career in both good and evil.
Sillanpään's career grew to a total rise by winning the tango crown at the Seinäjoen Tang Market in 1995.
In the game, Sillanpää sang tango, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tangocopy to Sillanpä on the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the sounding of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää singed it on the tape in a terrible crap and only a couple of hours after the nighttime.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stuck!
The bridge is in the book.
As a huge hit to rise the song from the taltiation would not immediately guess that it was singed in the crap.
Although I was not physically the best, the trace was still good.
I learned that all the time I don’t have to demand myself perfect and top.
Another coincidence related to the most popular pieces of the man, which is told in the book, occurred almost a couple of years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from his then partner and the case ended in the texts of You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered by Saara Törmäsele were not the same as Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a plate that tells a true story of his own life, but the words of the piece that tells the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of a 7 days newspaper.
In the newspaper’s news, the reason for the divorce between Jari and his ex-lover was Jari’s excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but according to Jari, it was a full puppy and was not true.
Jari called the book in anger to the disc company and refused to sing the song, but he ended up singing it - and well so.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting for their empire out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of voters voted for the dissolution and 48 per cent would remain in the Union, although the voting week’s opinions predicted the opposite result.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous on the standpoint of staying in the EU.
None of the prestigious research institutions or universities figured for the difference, even though a couple of individual researchers could disagree with the majority of their profession.
The main western political mantra, the re-election slogan of former U.S. President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", flew into a breakthrough in the UK's Brexit referendum.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
The Economic Character
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its last monthly questionnaire, gives the community answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened, because this time the voters made the decision on other than economic grounds.
One explanation for economists to the loss of the status of the economy is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant therefore.
If a immigrant gets a job, it is right away from the UK.
Many also have the idea that the decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
The Economist’s opinion is that voters did not believe in economic arguments because the economic consensus was not sufficiently highlighted.
They were disgraceful by the BBC’s equality, which gave just a couple percent of the space to EU economists profiting from the dissolution than to the overwhelming majority.
The EU hostile press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power combinations about the consequences of the difference are.
Those distant letter combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, then they were not communicated, because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
The academics of the major cities, such as economists, would have remained in the EU, but in small cities and rural areas, the message was not effective.
Immigration is an economy.
The Brexit referendum’s top winning argument concerned immigration.
The immigrant takes your workplace, the immigrant ruins your hospital, the immigrant uses it for you.
These arguments go.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health center there are immigrants.
How much easier would a British have medical periods if they were not?
There are immigrants in every school.
How much easier would true British children get a school place if they were released from them?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would the early residents have, if they disappeared?
I think these are economic issues.
These apply to jobs, houses and public services.
However, the economists did not respond to them, and if they succeeded, their answers did not get visible.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the UK has more jobs, fewer health services and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants – and especially EU immigrants – are net payers of the UK’s public economy and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen's Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are held by Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans for A and B.
The plan B for the winning of the EU disagreement camp was started to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote for the result of leave.
The worries were that investors began to withdraw their assets from the market.
Real Estate Funds normally do not have considerable liquid funds, but now they might be needed.
We went to grow cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says Aberdeen’s only daily open, notorious real estate fund that the news touched.
The normal rate is 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund was at the time 3.5 billion pounds.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen on all the UK real estate funds open real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest cash amount in these funds remained to or even below 10 percent.
The real estate funds, therefore, prepared for Brexit for a very different strategy.
Funds Closed Trading
When the disagreement camp won, Europe was confused.
In the real estate market, however, the less than two weeks following the vote were quite quiet, Vanhanen says.
There were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of the CEO of the British Central Bank, Mark Carney, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen their transactions.
Together, they robbed the situation and raised the case to the headquarters of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to the years 2007 and 2008, the Oldman says.
This caused investors to be nervous.
Institutional investors remained quieter, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to rotate, and the foundation after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash assets collected, but he also eventually had to freeze his trading for six days.
According to the old, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the price to the bottom.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether it is worth pulling the money out in panic.
The message of Aberdeen was that if you are not forced to take your money out, it is not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and the majority canceled the announcement.
After that, it was fairly stable, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks, the Old Man says.
He notes that, for example, there has not been any similar flooding in the Funds of the Continental Europe of Aberdeen.
However, there was a lot of queries.
Inappropriate attention to real estate funds
It is believed that the closure of the trade in real estate funds received unreasonably much attention.
The open funds covered by the closures control about four percent of the real estate in the UK.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties from 80 of its London properties.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may keep its fund closed for the end of 2017.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and the economic growth forecasts have been downward, but the situation does not look "lower" to Aberdeen.
The biggest concerns now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, the Old Man notes.
The price of the pound and the dollar is the weakest in the past 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, the old says.
Brexit leads down to London Real Estate Market
At 2 p.m. the situation did not seem strange.
But in four, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager of the British Real Estate Fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The power was in it.
I realized that this is now going on the side of plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV streams normally set out to be noise in the office infiltrated the news, and the normally noise people silenced to listen completely when Prime Minister David Cameron came in the morning before the camera to tell his divorce.
When the markets opened, the display ends blinked merely red.
It was a morning that he would never have believed to live, says the Old Man.
Not at all that despite the crowdfunding, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, ended a day after the Brexit referendum, i.e. two real estate transactions.
The mood was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was somehow calm, the Old Man says.
Brexit voting begins reform
The vote was followed by a storm.
The punta collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to predict severe rates for the UK and the London real estate market.
London's offices were expected to get up to 20 percent down in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
The storm has gone down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
This is not the last day of his summer holidays this week in Helsinki.
I think it’s too early to say a lot about Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, about, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
Property service company CBRE’s information on price developments covers about a third of the market.
The prices of all London real estate fell 3.3 percent from June to July.
In London City’s office buildings, the mines amounted to 6.1 per cent, the Old Man lists.
The numbers are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and in only five months there have been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equal declines hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, however, that Brexit was compared quite quickly to the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began from the U.S. real estate market.
This is not the case, because it is now a crisis in Britain.
The feeling is another.
The real estate market now has not seen such a panic sales as at that time, but a desire to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Financing is normal as well.
It could have been corrected in any case.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle for him—this could have been before without Brexit as well.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of real estate in London and other world's top cities have been too high for years.
We’ve been saying for two years that City and the offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
The fall started very high.
London prices have risen up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the London population as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last property class that is globalizing, the Old Man says.
The Middle East and Asia have become new operators on the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments from abroad.
London is known as a city of easy destination.
In addition, the prices have been fed by a low interest rate, which has led to the fact that, for example, pension companies have been forced to look for profits from new items.
On this basis, the loan has been easily available - although the debt pain has been used now clearly less than during the 2008 crisis-precedent boom.
Decentralized, decentralized
In London, the price increased last summer, the Old Man said.
Aberdeen also began to relieve its ownership in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turning expected, and now it came.
What about this next?
It depends on how the British national economy develops, the Old Man says.
Much he doesn’t dare to evaluate the future, but he says that no rise is hardly allowed.
The mood indicates that there is a drop or stable go ahead.
He has seen more movements up and down since he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And still he is an optimist who believes that the crap can be solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
They believe in global decentralization.
If you’ve invested in one market, there’s too much victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are decentralized, the old says.
S-Group begins to register purchasing details more detailed
The S group will soon know what you eat, as the trade group announced today that it will begin to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its main customers.
As for now, the information has been collected on the end amount of the quota, the group will begin to disclose it from the purchased products in early May.
The S-Group is following this Centre, as the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Centre’s customer register for a couple of years.
Ismo Riitalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, said the feedback from the program was mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and is used with permission for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product data, Riitala says to the Economy.
According to him, the Central Committee will not respond to the S-Group registration change.
The center will classify its fast customers in a group of ten according to just food purchases.
The rating is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for customer-oriented marketing.
Product-specific purchasing information is collected only from the K Group’s own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a position-customer program and there is no such in this set of plans.
The Finnish Near Trade has its own One-Bonus-Contact Customer Program, which can be joined in the Selection Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We are not currently collecting product or product group-level information, we are staying at the end sum level of the quota.
That is, we know where in the store the purchases were made and my day as well as the customer's quota of the final amount.
We have not gone to the level as the K group or the S group, says commercial manager Anu Ora.
According to him, the client program is intended to be reformed in the future, but the nearby store will tell you about it later.
However, it does not promise that the product information will be registered.
The first experiment
So far, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively extensive.
Basic information includes not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, form of residence and children’s births and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
On the S-Premium Card purchase is stored the date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of purchases and the payment method.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners is obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing data will begin to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S markets, Prismo, Home Terras and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing can be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of customer ownership and partnership operations at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data will be stored on the box in any case, whether you want it or not.
The applicant may check the data stored on the S-Group website.
For example, the casinos do not have access to the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Tull's newest dog creation - the dog becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador boyfriend striking five similar boxes on line at the Helsinki-Vanta airport.
It doesn’t take a long time when it is determined to sit next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog by playing it with his favorite gameplay.
From the box next to which Heila was sitting, there were a blurry of smellful spots for food gas.
Fruit gas is the first smell that Heila has now been exercised, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online trading
Heila is Tull’s first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vanta airport next year.
Work tasks may take Heila and Suntion, if necessary, to other border crossing sites and ports as well.
However, the airport will be the main workplace of Heila as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
Attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in the Tull and the control has been strengthened after the attacks, says Tull superintendent Mikko Grönberg.
Another main reason for training a weapon and explosive dog for the Tull's tasks are the postal shipping through Helsinki-Vanta.
As the internet trade has increased, up to 40 million mail ships are passed through the airport each year, including supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
Over the past few years, the customs authorities have made in the Helsinki-Vanta airport online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and aircraft, about 300 findings related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their originals.
Heila will work all over Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will investigate registered luggage and postal shipping.
The ports of it will have a great benefit in the future when it can pass through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the Heila, the Customs will evaluate whether further weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful for the idea.
School of Church
Heila-puppy education is coordinated by the Tull Dog School located in the Church.
Suntio is training with Heila also with the police and the Defence Forces experts.
Police have a strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Force has expertise in explosives.
The customs will decide in conjunction with other authorities what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
We will always be trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vanda are Tull’s six narcotic dogs and money and narcotic dog Massi.
Heila Labrador has been chosen from the ten dog pets.
The criteria for choosing a dog to go to the airport include hunting and hunting, as well as tranquility, as the dog is in contact with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
No one can get home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Fine orders go to Heila from a single hole.
Night-Sunnomien cameraman loses the camera's microprotection to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-like protection immediately with the "going" command.
Hard competition for dogs
The initial training will be completed next year.
There are still levels tests ahead, next to October, which will assess whether education is sufficient for demanding job tasks.
Heilan will be able to see jobs in Helsinki-Vanda in the middle of next year if everything goes as planned.
Passengers, unfortunately, can’t come to silence the dog on the work sheets, reminds Suntio.
The cost of a working dog is approximately €60,000 to €70,000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work days will only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Working dog owners are a strong competition.
The owner of the Heila requested about 20-30 Tull employees.
Happiness hit Suntion, who has not previously had a working dog, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory tasks in Tull.

Threatening Modern Family Star Shows Again: Teen Star Shorts Discover Almost Everything
In the modern family comedy series, Ariel Winter, who gets acquainted with Alex Dunphyna, is scared again by presenting a threat to his body.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don’t leave a lot of imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also the back.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior to much more courageous.
The star has poseed in the pictures she posted on social media in very few clothes and took numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing in very small shorts.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of herself during the celebration.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
In that case, PowerwomenTV's founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the era of the Kardashians.
She has learned that the more she looks out of the open surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actress has stumbled some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It’s not difficult to guess where he’s going to be in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans instead defend the actress and urge to be uninterested by criticism.
You look great!
It is the same what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, throwing a young woman.
Japanese people prefer from the north to Finland - tourists are attracted by the revontul: In autumn it is possible to see the sad mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start rebounds from the beginning of September, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main targets of the Japanese revolt tour are Inari and Levi.
The Revontulets are the water cards of our winter tour, and they are strongly combined with the heart winter and snow landscapes.
In Lapland, winter flights have a great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn flights.
Rarely people know that the revontulisone begins early in the autumn and continues long until the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake's surface reflects the revontulates making the look twice as famous, says Anne Lind, marketing manager at Visit Finland.
Visit the main target group of the Finland Revenge Campaign are wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35, living in the city, dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already ready to be interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from the Aalto University and the University of Turin and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptional strong and positive landscape among Japanese people compared to other northern countries.
The Japanese, however, needed more clear unique sights from Finland, and here the revontul has a huge potential according to Lind.
The number of Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly compared to other northern countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese tourists are interesting in terms of tourism in Finland, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
The average Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to be satisfied with the silver in the rugby-7 match when the Fiji championship won gold
The impressive success of the UK in the seven-player rugby match broke dramatically when Fidzi defeated it on Thursday at the Rion Deodoro stadium in the final chapter 43–7.
Fidzi gave the teachings to the champions in ball processing, transfer, side-rays, support games, running lines and rays in force and thus won gold – if the country had the first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The loss meant a silver, which was a little smaller than a greater regret for Britain as it was the country’s third silver the same day. They can be proud of their success as the Olympics in the first Rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strict victory from the South African Boxing in the 7–5 semi-finals earlier on the same day could have a negative impact on the team in the final.
Nevertheless, the Fidz team in this form would have defeated the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full strength.
The United Kingdom may be comforted by the fact that at least one British receives the golden medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, a former coach from Wimbledon for the English rugby-7 team.
The experience was quite good for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, in Ryan's training, they lost all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss is painful, but progress is terrible.
Fidzi started greatly and presented his tracking skills to the UK for interest.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams had encountered a group of moving buses, and the world champions rose 5–0 to the lead when Osea Colinisau made a drop to the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai scored the second goal on the right line.
The situation was 12-0, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent scratch prevented the reasonable Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it didn't slow down Fidz's departure for a long time.
When the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored the goal to the right corner, after which the UK was 17–0 losing.
Nakarawa made the second goal of the continuation initiative, with the first half of the game remaining more than a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou fell through the increasingly impotent traps of the British team and fell over the painting line.
After the break, the opening period ended at 29-0.
It turns out that the fidges are like born to play a seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the genre in the role of a pupil.
What is mostly true.
Great Britain made large-scale changes in the mid-time and managed to hold the fidels for a total of four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half until Josua Tuisova scored the goal thanks to the fidels' excellent team game.
Dan Norton managed to reduce the situation to 36–7 by making the UK a goal to the left corner, but the game was long ago lost to the South Sea islanders whose fans sing, swallowed tickets and danced.
It was hard to not admire Fitz’s pure and ridiculous attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final order for the Fiji cake by making the goal in the last minutes.
The pillars sounded, the Fidzians seized each other, and the British fell into the field, perfectly broken.
Earlier this day, Fidzi had won Japan in the semi-finals in chapters 20–5, and the United Kingdom had been pushed over South Africa in a strict semi-finals, where the equal situation was solved by the United Kingdom's match.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the painting line with his stunning footwork and fell under the paintings in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of the English 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson, signs the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win gold
More emotional could not be gold in these matches.
From the first to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning beat the history with 220 winning bets and found an additional goal for their golden moment in Estacio da Lago.
Though they were two in the air, the voice of the third coach Robin Williams flocked on the boat, encouraging them to the second consecutive Olympics in the women's twins. This makes them the first women in the history of British sport to reach the same achievement.
Their superiority was undisputed, the victory was for them already 39 consecutive and again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the water surface as they get to age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind each corner, there is a large set of helpful hands, each of which has contributed twins towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who then didn't know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was severe at that time.
"I had urethra cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It’s a bit changing my mind.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was fortunate that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season period in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if now so in such circumstances can even be said.
“I needed money, so I had to recover quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department at 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
This is where it begins.
The call in itself is already a journey, but this has made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the victory the thoughts of the twins were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more than normal while trying to overcome his own discomfort.
Captain Stanning of the British royal squadron, who was behind the tour of Afghanistan, says: “I’ve been in ruins this week, which may be somewhat extreme, but it means so much.”
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years of Helen and Robin’s cash has been fantastic.
Without Robin we’t be anything, so incredibly great thanks to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition over the past five years.
The twins have found a supreme rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw comparisons.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
“We’ve got a lot in a moment.
Helen River: Stay with me, Stay with me.
It is very important that you don’t get out of the route.”
"We managed to go out well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
We didn’t target heaven today, we just wanted to make a good triumph and win the race we did.”
The two think a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will celebrate next month on a TV show with the acquainted Steve Backshall
He just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure.”
“It took about six months after London, before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland to exchange Panama government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are demanded by the wrath of the Panama data years demonstrators in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians have turned off taxes through tax parishes.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His followers, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is scheduled for October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people’s recent anger will impact the autumn election outcome.
In the presidential elections in June, the criticism of the rulers was clearly visible, and the president was elected by Gudni Johannesson, a non-political candidate.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repealed his last discourse.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton participated in the organization's creation.
The Democratic Party was angry with the talks and asked for apologies from Trump.
As the army's chief should never let anyone who can fall around down, Clinton quoted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the burkini swimming clothes that cover Muslims’ favour, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
In the decision signed by Prime Minister David Lisnard, it is prohibited to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who does not have a good way and a swim dress that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimming pools that greatly express religious connections may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist groups attacked a church in northern France and killed a 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the swimming waters in the region of Oulu passed through the seil - in Pyykösjärv
The water samples taken from the official swimming plants of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for the swimming water.
Only on the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Environmental Action of the Oulu Region took water samples from nine EU shores and 30 other public swimming shores located in the Oulu Region.
The concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcus bacteria in all swimming pools, with the exception of the sea shore, were below the measures set by the Ministry of Social and Health Regulations.
The levels of E.coli and enterococcus were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial levels had decreased below the operational range.
The blue lighting observed on the swimming pool of Pyykössee does not yet make the water swimless, but in favourable circumstances the situation can quickly become a blue lighting surface, forming a blue-green lighting mass on the water surface.
The environmental policy is monitoring the situation through intensified inspections.
If the blue lighting becomes a blue lighting, it will also be separately on the swimming pool notification field.

MCC for the reduction of forest donations: More than 80 percent of forest owners are outside
The reduction of forest funds is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for the next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax discount, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the generation exchange of forestry.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest donations has four objectives: to promote the change of generations in forest spaces, to younger the age structure of forest owners, to increase the forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of the forest economy.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation change of forest spaces is good, says Juha Hakkarainen, the forest director of the Central Union of Farmers and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, it is critical for the tax change process.
Reduction of forest funds is made on the net capital income of the forest owner.
This is the capital income from which all other discounts have been removed.
MTK and Hakkaraisen believe the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales income of the wood.
The proposal is based on the fact that the reduction of the forestry net capital income will prevent the loss of the forestry capital income that should be reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if the tree was not sold.
The calculation is uncomplicated.
The average forest owner is unable to imagine it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model affects only a small portion of forest owners.
The limit of the tax reduction linked to the income value of the forest is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It has been drawn too high to Hokkaido’s view.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 82 percent of Finnish forest owners are excluded.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest ownership, he says.
In the VM, it is believed that the border guarantees the goal of the growth of the space.
In the forest policy, the reduction of forest donations has been trained for decades, according to Hakkaraisen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
The average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of the forest owners are retirees.

There is no more detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to the Fish River.
Research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent findings of researchers from the University of Åbo can help develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings made by the research group of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignity of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissues, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was able to prevent in laboratory conditions by restoring the tumor surrounding tissue to meet normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be able to improve by focusing on the treatment of cancer cells in addition to the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in cell biology.
The family murder of Muos continues in the court, the prosecutor calls for a murder sentence also to another criminal
The family murder of Muos continues in the court for both prisoners.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family murder in Muhoks.
The other one received 8 years and 4 months, among other things, as a young man, for the murder and brutal robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and brutal robbery.
The convict was also sentenced to serious threat to road safety as a young person and to carry a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the prosecutors and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor calls for a young man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young man.
They were in full understanding.
According to the court, a 17-year-old boy killed a man who worked as a director of a school house child protection unit in July last year.
A 17-year-old man who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the sofa in the living room.
The director had been able to get out of the car and brought the young man into his room, where one of the young people hit him with a thumb.
The director was also, among other things, tortured by the leadership, shot and kicked into the head.
According to the investigation, both prisoners were fully understood at the time of the crime.
According to the law, the young people had planned a break from the family house at least since the previous day.
This is the world’s longest-lived backbone, it only grows at the age of 156.
The longest living spine in the world is a ice hole, a study published in the journal Science says.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice hole can live up to 400 years.
It grows only at the age of 156.
The life of the ice is increased by the fact that it grows only a centimeter per year.
Only one species is known to live the ice for longer.
The researchers discovered the age by radiochemistry.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive remains.
The researchers were able to assess the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated to be 392 years - though the throw in a direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as the Economic Wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need a different world.
Up to a third of all tax revenues in the country would be missing if Donald Trump's change to corporate tax was implemented.
The tax revenue would also decrease, especially with the wealthiest profitable tax discount.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35 percent to 15 percent.
It would be a huge amount, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest percentage of income tax is now 39.6, after Trump’s reduction of 33.
The inheritance tax will be dismissed.
Trump accused the state of overregulating the business and driving small into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards adopted by the fireworks must be renewed and the regulation on the energy sector must be repealed.
Barack Obama’s health reform needs to be taken into consideration.
The government must appoint “experts rather than bureaucrates.”
The “destructional” trade policy is, according to Trump, the main cause of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements will be withdrawn.
China will impose a 45% tax on imports and Mexico will impose a 35% tax on imports.
We offer a new future.
Americanity, not globalism, is our religion, Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world
American cars come to drive on the streets, American aircraft to connect cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new clouds throughout the country.
Unlike his goals, Trump loyally read through the speech written by his assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests stopped it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her program early on Friday.
The History of the Past - People's News
The sea blows fatally, but the real attack wave strikes in the middle of the street wave of Madrid - the accounting with the past can begin.
This is the core of Pedro Almodóvar’s novel story.
Almodovar's previous director's Journeys (2013) was a little-thinking and snorkeling satire comedy, the previous Iho in which I live (2011) the Spanish tourist career tops.
Similarly, Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere between these two works.
It is a sovereign consistent love, human relationships and family framework, at the heart of which is the mother and daughter’s relationship.
The story is simple and can be seen long behind.
Life seems to be a model for the middle-age person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) must be in miracles until the movie's final meters.
In the form of a backbone and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
She starts from the time before the daughter’s birth, the moment when she met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female protagonist is Adraina Ugarte, presenting Julieta as a young teacher from the TV series The Time Between the Omels (2013-2014).
The aging of Juliet has been treated in a way that can be considered a crack, but I would say myself that it is quite hard and literally with a repeat.
For Almodóvar movies often so characteristic of humour, even in Juliet there is a fair distance.
It’s a fairly performed, humiliated, place in place with good music and a pretty sad movie with such elements of elegance.
Instead, the typical visual colorability for the Spanish director is stored and so that it begins to put a little silence into the eye more as a pure fashion style than as an active dramatic effect.
The people of the film are experienced by diseases, deaths or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains the same coral.
This is especially true for clothing: in the case of the name person, the habitat varies from scene to scene, and the same applies to appearance replacement.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the currents of this scene, are not improved.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written the script on the basis of three novels by the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature awarded Canadian Alice Munro.
The novel was published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced written literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally uncomparable to a thinner drama, so much big things – especially the shining guilt – the leff’s theme is dealt with.
Directed by: Pedro Almodóvar.
It is based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Actors: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie is 12.8.
The Government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be done, the ministers call to ensure that the Flanders do not collapse entirely.
However, the operations decided in the spring will be carried out on the rope trade.
There will be no new cuts.
The $4 billion savings are sufficient.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (central) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM’s proposal, as the cuts on social security were decided already in the spring framework.
Children’s pension, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 percent.
The period of unemployment insurance is shortened from 500 days to 400.
Training interruptions continue.
The municipalities are scared
Why are the ministers so strongly emphasizing that there are no new cuts on them?
The next year is the election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and they are the main heat meter of the election period, not the gallups.
It has previously been seen that the municipal outcome of the government parties in different directions will ruin the government’s mood for a long time.
However, the Gallup reports that the government party of the Northern Finns is expecting a rough deficit, although its previous elections resulted in modest 12.3 percent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Flanders received 752 new delegates, a large part of which will be realised in the next spring the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The life line of the government of three approximately equally large parties is in the midst of the fact that the front of the Flanders will be sustained.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters got enough of the government’s policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
There will be no new cuts—the rhetoric, first of all, confuses the fact that the next year they will be done rigorously and, second of all, attempts to soften the Persian strike.
Great cuts in 2018?
Within a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Siberian government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of reducing debt during this election period, but in the budget proposal of Petteri Orpo the debt will be taken next year by EUR 5.9 billion, which is more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise the hands up in the middle of the election period and admit that the government is unable to follow its own program: the debt is unlikely and even slowed down.
The second is to keep up with the program.
This means new, even harder cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be rounded at least close to the balance during the year 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will accept what will come.
This means that the debt is not
It’s quite clear that the current actions of debt don’t seem, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to get a positive mood.
The quarters presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe at the budget intelligence ceremony testify unreasonably:
The global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven universityist, meaning there is no petition on the international economy.
The Finnish national economy has not just risen since the collapse experienced in 2008, except for the period of the recovery policy carried out in the early 2010s.
The unemployment rate has increased by 35 per cent over the last decade and extended from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment costs now three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
The public debt, which exceeded the 60 percent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 percent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the left union’s debt withdrawal was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
In the next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which is practically covered by taking a completely new debt.
This is the concept of the center, the assembly, and the fundamental Finns of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of tasks.
Three out of four believe that the organization of children’s daycare, youth work and exercise belong to the municipal responsibility, according to a study by the KAKS – Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people assign responsibility to the individual municipality, including libraries, culture, citizen schools, building control, high school education and waste management.
The responsibility of the countryside, in turn, is most clearly desired by the countryside targeting, special care, professional education, vocational schools and institutional care for developing disabled people.
None of the municipal responsibilities are to be transferred to the state.
Minor rider rushed after the police flew
A 16-year-old motorcycle driver flew from the police station in Joensu in Ilomantsinti on Friday at half a hour.
The police tried to stop the motorcycle without light, but the young man went to drive the police to escape at fair high speed.
The back journey continued to the Sonkajan Range, from which it continued to the Sorronhaunt and to the smaller forest path where the motorcycle was driven out of the road.
Even after that, the young man escaped, but a faster police ran to the carrier.
The driver's shooting test showed a 0.75 promille.
He also did not have a driving license that would be permitted to drive a motorcycle.
The incident is investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The roof in the stone fell down.
The stone that was in the stone crashed on the side of the Polvijärv in Kaavinti on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The river had moved to the left in a bump out of the road and fell to the side of it.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the crashed trail through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first careers.
The lifting of the car remains the car owner’s task.
From the crashed trail, a hydraulic oil was thrown on the road which the rescue facility absorbed into the turf.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The old woman disappeared in the afternoon.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the airport in the southern part of the country.
The police are searching for a 165 cm long, thin and cool woman with white hair stretching under the leaf.
Notices and clues about missing movements are requested to call the Nordic State Center at the point number 0295440513.
Materials of Great Accident in the Air - see the image gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The crash of the Parafest festival tents caused considerable damage.
The chairman of the Joensuun Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will be financed, and the event can also be held next year.
The Parafest's last show, Kalle Salonen, appeared on the end of the Friday evening at the torrents.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the performances held in the premises of the City Theatre starting at 13 p.m.
The art center in Ahjossa is the Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is scheduled.
Flood flow occurs in the cloud when rain water and its weight trigger the decreasing air flow.
Changes in the condition of the water in the outskirts binding the heat, and thus the falling air is cooled and its speed towards the ground is accelerated.
According to the Meteorological Institute, floods occur in Finland over several years during the summer.
The routes of flooding are difficult to predict.
A shutdown strike hit the Joensuu Art Museum in Parafest on Friday afternoon before 5 a.m.
Three tents were destroyed, with a total of about 200 people in the tent.
Four people suffered mild injuries in the accident.
There was one child in the group who was transported with a mild injury to subsequent treatment.
Air pollution ages in London
The study found that the skin in London is aging faster than usual.
The cause of ageing is air pollution.
The study was published by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many retirees in London have a skin two and a half years older than a rural partner.
The skin aging small particles are a very fine dust pollutant, which is derived from transport fuel.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, kills 9,500 London people each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to pass through the deepest layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that premature aging is a risk especially for those in London who go on their work trip walking near stunning streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with a variety of masks, but a more practical solution is recommended to regularly clean the skin.
Traktor brakes cheated, man standing in front
The man had moved stones in a tractor.
When he had climbed out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor’s brakes were deceived and the tractor struck the man.
The man did not stay under it, but the tractor captured the dead man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital for further investigations as he was seriously injured.
The tractor did not go further, because it collided with the stones in front.
We have new strength for the next season.
The river player Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Champions League, starts a series that starts in October with better starting points than men’s memory.
The team has been in the box for three weeks.

Garchet is a passar, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimeters.
Josban, Katajan and Jokipoiki to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all of the salibandy World Cups since 2003.
Now there are already sixth matches in Tampere, only 2013 was between Canada becoming better in the North American matches.
I was working on the Market and playing with women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was creating a national team.
I was interested in it and this is what we are now, says Jumppane, 48.
Jumppane was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensu, such a species was not yet played at the SM level as a salibandy.
The game was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataya and later Jokipojis hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the salibandy SM series of the season 1991-92, the following three passes run in Josbas.
In addition to playing, he prepared the group A girls to the championship.
The female SM series climbed to the silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played women in the SM series 10 through, the balance was accumulated in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Tatu Väänänen and Perttu Puska were named in the country team
The river salibandiseur Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and the enolais-based Tatu Väänänen was elected to the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this before six men's countryside matches, where he has earned a total score of 9+4=13.
Switzerland’s Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defendant, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a row and is part of the national team’s standard board with 117 land matches experience.
The country team was also named Mika Kohonen, a concari player from the Seinäjoen Playliers, who was first seen in Finland in the last December World Cup.
The head coach of the Salibandy team is the counter player Petri Kettunen.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasun's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold lacks from the prize box
Essi Hasu will stop as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the last season.
The beach volleyball Finnish championships will be held in the weekend at the Kouvolan Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, the medals are played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the SM final tournament organized by the Kouvolan Airballers and the Finnish Airball Federation, the six best pairs of each series are qualified.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY’s grown Essi Hasu, who has been part of the top of Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible will visit this weekend.
There will be a great arena for the baseball.
I’m not playing in the adult series very often in Kouvolah, so it’s great to play in the finals at home, Hasu felt.
The Kouvolan countryside burned Hasu's pipe into the sport and gave good feeds to a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started the ball at the age of 9 in the NMKY's E-girl.
The top is the mind of a too big game tape, the knees that roll in the nails, as well as the brilliant axis and choreographs after the point, Hasu reminds.
At a small place, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team created an environment where it was comfortable to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the team friend's father prepared us and our mother was the chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in the youth’s age a natural sort choice as the counterweight of the interior ball.
The swimming pool has been playing bikes since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I was also going to watch the Junior SM Tour’s shares, thinking that one day I’d be playing there myself.
Now this dream is realised when Hasu plays the weekend together with the scratched Anniina Parkkisen in the SM finals.
The goal of Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde in the second round of the tournament is clear.
The realist goal is a medal.
SM gold is still lacking in the prize box, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend appearance in Kouvol may be the last known to Hasulle in front of the audience.
At the beginning of September, there will be new challenges in the field of civility.
The international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, backbags are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The air strike collapsed the tents during a disabled event in Joensu, the major accident was near

Solomon Koli is boldly becoming a farmer.
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, harshness and rigidity.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Koli started shortly two years ago, together with his little brother Valtteri Koli, as a continuation of their home status.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brother through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and expansion in the field so that bread could come to the hand from agriculture.
This has been my story since childhood.
I’ve always pleased with the farm, and now that I started myself as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything into the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013 we went on to build a park and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it.
However, I went myself really boldly into the project and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells and adds that it would not have been taken if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything would turn to good.
Solomon Coli, who grows meat cars, is aimed at investing in a larger branch.
The work has produced results as Solomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for young food producers of the Rural Future magazine.
He is competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the newspaper’s website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1 percent in July.
This is the highest value in several years (after June 2012) and the first time it rises above its zero since October last year, when the country 0.2 percent positive inflation.
The average annual inflation measureed by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0,8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (June 2016 percent compared to December 2015 percent) has been –0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0,2%.

Snapchat's anime performance is criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that the filter was an anime, but some observers think it’s racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identities in ways that approach absurdity.
You can transform yourself into ananas, a dog or a character in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
The lenses are undecorated, characteristic distortion tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfie per day.
All errors will quickly come to general information.
Snapchat’s lenses have received a review where it has been accused of popularizing blackface makeup or whitened skin shades as a beauty issue.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into wines, distorted their teeth, and made the pocket bulbs, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian people ("yellowface").
The reviewers also wondered whether these repeated contradictions refer to a greater problem that the company has with the diversity.
The news and anger spread broad on Wednesday and was written by the online publications The Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat announced that it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended for an honor to anime characters, not a cartoon of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strikingly disputed the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet of the images was widely shared, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and tempting."
He adds: “It’s hard to deny the comparison of a very tasty Asian carcass with the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a “yellowface”, but a one that is brought to the degrading extreme.”
Snapchat is not the only company that has to avoid these cultural disadvantages.
In American culture, it feels like there is an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and to the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience consists of young people who are ethnically more diverse than their parents in exchange. This may mean that they are likely to expect subtility even more.
“When one of Snapchat lenses creates an image that offends a user, this kind of things will no longer be very easily unnoticed, as before,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
As a product manager and designer, Zhu, who worked at the Medium publishing site, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his media post and telephone interview, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company as a majority of the white and male leadership and decided to write with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that their unilateral staff has no colourful people in which they can make such decisions, or then they also have colourful people as employees, but their position is not that they will dare to express their opinion directly and easily,” says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company will not publish numbers of the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, referring to its status as a private enterprise.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesman said the company has recently hired a recruiter intended to focus on underrepresented groups and promote inclusion within the company.
In his contribution, Zhu says he will keep his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
Congress experts say military officials have distorted intelligence information about ISIS
The Congress’s expert group published a report on Thursday that officials from the US Armed Forces, the Central Command, changed the intelligence reports so that they would give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the field gave the subject to be understood.
The Republican presidents of the House Armed Services Committee's subcommittee responsible for intelligence and defense funds founded a working group, whose interim report reports the armed intelligence analytics' "general dissatisfaction."
The Central Command, shortly Centcom, is a headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces located in the Florida state of Tampa, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior leaders of the Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terrorist actions than the facts on the field showed, and were without exception more positive than the analysis of other intelligence units," the report said in a press release.
“Centcom’s events can’t be accepted – our soldiers suffer when high-level political decision makers are submitted to false analysis,” said California’s Republican deputy Ken Calvert.
“Centcom’s leadership errors reach the top level of the organization.”
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015, which are included in the Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports submitted by the Obama administration had been falsified, it gives analysts a picture of the idea that the Centcom leaders would have pressed them to present a more optimistic view of the threat caused by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press reports, statements and witness statements made to the Congress were much more positive than the events were in reality," the report said.
“For example, a Centcom official publicly issued a statement that a large military breakdown to regain Mosul could take place in April or May 2015.”
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
“After months of investigation, this is very clear,” Kansas Republican deputy Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the U.S. Armed Forces highest-ranking intelligence leaders manipulated the results of the intelligence to reduce the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans founded a working group after getting aware of the analysts’ suspicions that the intelligence information about ISIS would be manipulated.
The report, which was published on Thursday, follows more detailed results, as the research continues.
In addition, the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Defense has launched an investigation into the intelligence data of Centcom.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the Committee responsible for the investigation of the House of Representatives published their own findings, which were partially consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Thro the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a too limited process to evaluate intelligence information about ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic representative of the committee.
According to Schiff, this process "retarded the publication of the investigation results, "rejected the morality of analysts" and "not observed sufficiently differentiated views."
According to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to press Centcom’s analysts to adjust their conclusions to “predefined or political official line.”
The Daily Beast news site on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congress’s study.
Last August, the New York Times the Pentagon superintendent investigation, which was initiated as a result of lawsuits made by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Colonel Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense will not comment on Congress's report as long as the investigation of the supervisor is ongoing.
However, he says that: "Specialists sometimes disagree about the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other follow-up consequences in addition to the attempt to find out whether the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have succeeded (a growing number of claims submitted by defence authorities).
However, the claims submitted last year could question how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and the fact that it gives honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of ISIS intelligence responds to the disagreements arising more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published an investigation that the President George W. Bush government, despite the opposition of many analysts, supported only small troops to Iraq and spent only a little time considering what the 2003 invasion would follow.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the ISIS intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Working Group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, the attacks on ISIS-controlled refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group’s economy because it had built temporary refineries and thus was able to sell oil on the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not communicated outside the Central Command, the Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had estimated the witness statements given to the Senate were too positive ratings about the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of the Central Command.
The U.S. will win the fourth double battle in women's land shock and establish its position for interference with Britain
After scored three goals in a win-win match 6–1 against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's land hockey team on Thursday, when the U.S. defeated India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
“I don’t have any idea,” he says.
“I don’t belong to people who keep the number of paintings they make.”
But he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost a zero game and share the first place in their group with Britain, which continued to win on Thursday with Japan 2–0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will play against each other on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams suffered a final match, which determines which of the six teams will be ranked first and which second.
The first place is to avoid a longer time of encounter with the hard-thought Dutch team, who won the second block.
Despite the way Saturday is going on, the Americans have already raised the top of their surprising success in these matches, four years after it remained the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
He was also in the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the land hockey for the first time when he was only 3 years old (his parents in his double marriage played the species in Drexel).
The 2008 Olympics left him away when he failed to survive the final player list.
After that came the 2012 matches where he and his team had little success.
The next year the coach was named Craig Parnham, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, spiritual and physical,” Bam says.
"Our job in London was not the same as it is now.
We have made a complete translation.”
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the painting account in the first half by shooting the ball near the crossroads inside.
India had entered the game without any tournament win, but it turned out to be a surprisingly hard opponent and retained the 1–0 position until the third season when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, climbed to the middle field, hit the ball into the paintings and thus brought the Americans 2–0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth season.
The game was the first of the tournament in which the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the U.S. goalkeeper had a single hit.
Briggs is now living in a successful year.
Just like Bam.
"Our investment is now good," says Parnham, but how good it is, it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympic hole, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympics are inevitable.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and battles seem to be the next vibrant message constantly and everywhere.
It’s like the Olympic fire itself is a lightweight messenger that moves from a swimmer to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can’t open the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the cafe line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympic first-time Dooley glorifies with a smile and might well be a name on everyone’s lips, which would appear and belong to the best time of watching and listening, would be the favourite of sponsors and would appear in good mind TV ads if he was just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swimmer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympics do not equally light all competitions.
Longer than the center, partially in the shadow are less known sports, such as airball, skiing, final football and taekwondo.
We will always have a breasts, and the championship will remain for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special writer, I want to pay attention to the humbled charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic type since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility has been so low over the past 16 years that many people I interviewed didn’t even know it was an Olympic type.
Unknowledge may be regional.
The U.S. has already participated athletes in the Olympic Championship, but the country has never reached the medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the trampoline of men, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and on the female side of the medals there are two Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
In the trampoline, however, there is the charm of the sublime. Partly because of the non-civilized ear it sounds more suitable for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(I admit in this context that I am not an expert, only a regular fan.)
The species have a comic potential, which in cartoons has been used in the endless continuous bombings of characters. But it also has the same value as in fitness and swimming, i.e. in species that are associated in the trampoline essentially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "ponservation plate".
Ambitious masters jump on a massive trampoline that shakes them to a height of 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, the jumpers need to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as turns, turns, and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, the jumpers are criticized on the basis of performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, the championship of trampoline fitness competes with 32 athletes from 17 different countries. 16 of them are men and 16 are women.
The most common Olympics is direct forward.
When we seek gold, we need to get further, faster, up and above, sometimes over the paint, sometimes forward around the field.
In addition to painting or starting wall, they also have another goal to which they are pursuing in television reportages, namely a world record or an Olympic record.
This determined quest is superb, admireable, even fanatic – and is enough to get the spectator in tears.
But I think that’s a bit unfortunate just when I watch the games.
This trampoline provides breathing.
The trampoline is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The worker climbs up without weight like an astronaut, falls down and throws back up without effort.
Of course, the line also includes a competitive aspect, and it is not easy, but it does not involve a sharp climb in the painting or jumping far, only a dreamful and slurry combination of time and gravity.
It is so close to the Zen as only the Olympic competition can get.
Women's basketball and final matches will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men's match on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC broadcasts the final as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts every day at 14.00 local time.
The midst of the Olympiamania brings a quiet and wonderful moment that in the midst of the general madness might be unnoticed.
And if the awareness can be increased only by offering appealing male athletes and objectivizing them – as U.S. male athletes recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley will only expect a remarkable new fan group.
A whole generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently disrupted political change demands across Ethiopia.
Observators say several protesters were shot dead in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia Disintegrated?
Over the last decade it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable Western ally, whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been overwhelmed by anti-government protests, which are spreading to increasingly wider regions.
Only last week thousands of people walked to the streets demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was unreasonable.
According to the observers, the police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The protests are supposed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, and the videos show how security forces shoot young people who are forced to stand with their hands on the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights activist now calls for a thorough investigation.
“To keep the country united has always been difficult, and to move forward is even more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, director of the African Sarvi International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa to promote stability by Western countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting the Ethiopian people in the fight against terror threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if no, get so much help from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital Addis Abeba is even a new railway.
The city streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy. human rights organizations have constantly about the government’s striking policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and the interdisciplinary people are rapidly suppressed.
Many people have been deported from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed, and they have no choice but to show their minds, they will disappear," says Seyoum Teshome, a professor at the University of Central Ethiopia.
“The whole youth shows his mind.
The whole generation protests.”
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, from the land use to the government coalition's disciplinary product of power.
After the widespread criticism of last year’s elections, the ruling party and its allies got the last place before the opposition, which resulted in them now dominating the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the border of Eritrea, where the worsened situation demanded hundreds of deaths in the June struggle.
Analysts are afraid that over the past few years more or less broken separatist groups, such as the Oromos Liberation Frontier or the Ogaden People's Liberation Frontier, may attempt to exploit confusion and rearm themselves.
The reason why the rough mood that has been under the surface for years is disappearing right now, there are many reasons.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last few years the Ethiopian people have been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became popular and internet access improved.
Even when the government has repeatedly blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many of them, however, have access to the internet through the brokerage servers that encrypt their location.
Many Ethiopian youths said they called people to demonstrate.
The second reason is the increased solidarity between the two largest population groups of Ethiopia, the oroms and the amhars.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
The Amhars of Ethiopia, mostly from the Christian upper mountains, have long dominated the country’s politics and business and destroyed the rivers, many of which are Muslims and live in suburban areas.
But this is also changing.
“Cooperation is deepening and we’re getting under the same shadow,” says the oromo director Mulatu Gemechu.
The major protests have occurred in the area of Orom and Amhar.
Many amhares and oroms feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the tiger tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the discomfort is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebellion leader Meles was Etiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical nerve who was able to see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was skilled in detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate the opposing parties.
“The current government is lacking this essential instinct,” says conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, went on to Meles from almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, which came from the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the Tiger Heaven.
Many people are afraid that this will mean further bleeding.
For the first time in Ethiopia, similar conflicts occurred in 2005, when thousands of people demonstrated their minds against elections, which the government, according to analysts, first stole and then steal.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed; the number of deaths was less than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for the remote-looking infrastructure planning, such as the new railway, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the inner regret to the Ethiopian government has not clearly prevented it from becoming stronger.
And the beauty is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the city of Gondar, the protesters attacked the companies owned by the tigers, and the hate speech against the tigers is growing on social media.
According to analysts, the protests are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in the underlying situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a support destination for unemployed, neighboring Somalia aircraft monitoring, but the support base has recently been closed, according to the U.S. government.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an unstable region to collapse.
“This requires strict balance,” says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he is sarcastic when he claims that Obama is the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to withdraw his words back in his last campaign controversy, claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly claimed this week President Obama and Hillary Clinton as the "founder" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side of the presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of their country.
His supporters will also be in a challenging situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not mean.
Trump presented the claim at a Wednesday evening election and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump tweeted his speech from the previous day when he said in several interviews he was quite serious about his accusations.
When radio broadcaster and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not agree to withdraw from his claim.
The latest criticism hurricane raised when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy in decreasing support numbers.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy linear speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump attempted to return to the issue.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and considered Clinton's speech disappointing.
Trump has previously defended the sarcasm.
At the end of July, she received widespread criticism when she seemed to invite the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s email. He later explained his comments by saying, “Naturally, I was sarcastic.”
In this way, Trump extends the boundaries of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way to test certain messages that trigger a contradiction in his supporters. He sees how supporters react to the messages, and then “clear” in a way or another depending on the reactions,” says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through different seals."
Instead of softening his statements to the electoral audience, Trump has changed his style even more stunning in recent days as his votes have continued to fall.
A new opinion survey by the NBC, the Wall Street Journal and the Maristin published on Friday showed that Trump’s support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is strictly equal.
While Trump usually tries to avoid asking for forgiveness for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his humor.
But after becoming more and more attentive in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his faithful supporters in a tempting position where they are forced to publicly defend Trump’s comments no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended his presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I keep his messages justified, a political speech," Giuliani replied when asked if Trump was true when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded the ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama erroneously called a 'lower series team' and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most representative Republicans are trying to argue that Obama’s administration, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to continue its actions as it did not resolutely deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Friday election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of blaming his speeches and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He scratched the "unreliable and foolish" TV commentators who are trying to get out of him, but he says he can't succeed in it.
Some Democrats blamed Trump’s explanation and said it would only show more clearly that he was not suitable for the presidency.
Caused by unfair rental rise, a coffee shop is opened in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a somewhat rough cafe in Williamsburg, where the payment was only cash and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, a cafe had to be priced out of its street guard in Bedford Avenue when the rental was unreasonable.
Verb Cafe replaced in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie sells cupcake-shaped soap.
The local residents consider this middle-up to avoid the loss of the caffeine.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know yes, but I can't still believe that the CBGB club is no longer there, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap store."
Although New York is no longer the former, there is also a new building.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpointi, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and it can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unfinished.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When one customer was offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things off.
Verb keeps the bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso model.
In addition, it reintroducted even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he also wanted to try something new and
Add new products to the list.
There are pekon-cannabis-chicken cheese sandwiches available and for filling caprice and scratched seeds.
The list also contains dark clothes.
There is no more beer from coffee, but instead fresh fruit juices.
After keeping a coffee for nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed the beginning of the old regular customers to go to Verb with a flat urine.
“Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg,” he says.
One of those is Rebecca Oliveira, who went to a cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpointi, he made a walk trip to Verbi in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I loved Verbin’s coffee and culture,” he says.
Now he’s drinking coffee again, though on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his regular ice coffee, which is also a list news.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
She went to the cafe before working and ordered the same without exception.
"I went to the cafe every day for more than seven, like a machine, and there they already prepared my voibagel with all the fillings," she tells.
Picture: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the dining.
Nowadays, Rosenthal continues to produce its standard product, but from time to time, it varies its bagel with bakery, chicken honey and cheese samples.
Rodriguez says it’s not a good thing to say that the soap shop took the old place.
Soap Cherry owners were even offered to produce a special soap, for the manufacture of which Verbin’s own cold-covered coffee was used.
“We can still take the offer,” Rodriguez says.
Traditionally living in Greenpoint, the Poles have also welcomed the coffee with pleasure.
One of the new customers turned the table to Poland, and Rodriguez now says he’s looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell coffee in a coffee shop.
The cafe can also be extended to the nearby building.
For many customers, however, it is enough that they get their own old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the cafe was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like I had come home, says Whitt.
I smelled the coffee.
Next Post:A Square Meal – A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as a culinarian, was pleased with the luxurious foods of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the refinery pasta and the Maryland shark cake.
On that day, his dish was more modest: the devil's eggs (deviled eggs) in a tomato cottage, potatoes and desserts from a cottage.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity to people suffering,” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds: "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's last book, named Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's last book, named 97 Orchard, tells the story of a floorroom in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new co-work is Harper’s edited and on Tuesday released A Square Meal, which depicts the history of American food as the 1930s’ great bread.
The couple demonstrated their own culinary solidarity by arranging a meeting place with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron Cloud Counter, which was opened in the same year as the big stock exchange crash occurred in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, in turn, calcium, potato and mixed sandwiches.
When the supplier ordered a meat market, the couple said it was suitable for a very large breeding discussion.
“The routes were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
“People ate the landpest, the liverpest, and the paparazzi.
They were made of materials that were cheap and disputed.
Imagine you’re eating so much potatoes that they’re enough for a whole meal.”
Andrew Coe is dismissed.
“It had to be pressed in the stomach like a rubber,” he says.
Before the great years of sheep, the American food table, especially in the countryside, worked on the buffet principle of "eating as much as you want."
The women made food for the farmers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner served counterfeit dishes.
It was the Americans who had sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways the people survived when the abundance was suddenly forced to give up.
"This was the time when food became a central and annoying topic for Americans," says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same worrying was a new cheap diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes like snacks and potatoes became the main food, and potatoes were said to be "a powerful way to take advantage of food sources" because cakes could cover not so attractive ingredients with a cream potato.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been the central part of American meal, became a spaciously used luxury.
We tried strange mixings, where the most important was the filling of calories and nutritional values and not so much taste or even a healthy kitchen mind.
During its research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven bottles filled with peanut butter as a disadvantage meal.
"It didn't get popularity on the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman added: “It was unrealistic.
Butterflies and peanut butter do not match at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.”
Home experts, like Louise Stanley, who served as head of the Federal Home Agency from 1923 to 1943, directed citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and journals, and encouraged women to be intentionally budgeters and to respond to the challenge of making delicious dishes of potatoes such as pork-kermaspaget.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic flavours.
Particularly delicious are statements of the government’s reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “Let Me Eat a Cake” attitude.
While he publicly praised his childhood’s simple food at the Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a refined master who had become him.
“He liked the continental European cuisine like fish and garlic,” Coe says.
“He ate almost in a gold-guided dining room, on top smoking.
He was completely distant from reality.”
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleanor had encouraged him to show an example on his stomach.
As in the book is stated, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economist who was not interested in the taste at all, the food served in the White House was not only Washington’s boring, but also the worst made.”
Many of the foods of the Lama era were abandoned as soon as the earth returned to its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition remains evident in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple, when writing the book, begin to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, why she couldn't throw out food.
“He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown out,” Coe says.
“People even started to be bad about his food,” Ziegelman reminds.
“For example, the wind.”
When the main dishes were empty at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out their home-made beans, the same that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a bone marrow," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a seeming name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no creme, only cranberries, a little powder, sugar, water and cannella.
We swallowed our teas in a thick brown mouth.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe ran for the second and for the third time.
“The German nuts would do this better,” Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Gilead's full remuneration for lawyer fees for hepatitis C patent triade with Merck
The U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to receive full compensation for the lawyer fees caused by a patent dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc. for hepatitis C.
Gilead was released in June for $200 million compensation for the violation of two Merck-owned patents in connection with Gilead's success contraceptives called Sovaldi and Harvoni. The U.S. judge noticed Merck's committed violations covered by misconduct and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to be exempt from the lawyer’s fees for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the markets with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat over 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case goes to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenge each other in court and demand the private property of the sofosbuvir under laboratory work.
U.S. supported troops have captured Manbij City by ISIS
U.S.-backed troops have captured the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border, in northern Syria, as the last extremist ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now searching the city to find the last ISIS fighters hidden in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters that 2,000 prisoners kidnapped by ISIS have been released.
“The city is now fully in our possession, but we are still carrying out search operations,” Darwish said.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released on Friday her 2015 tax declaration, which shows that her and her husband's revenue at that time was $10.75 million and they paid the actual federal tax percentage of $34.2.
Former President Bill Clinton earned $5.3 million in speech rewards, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced she earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's book on her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice-president candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton announced the 10 year tax declarations.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a model for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and rejects his promises to publish his tax data.
The U.S. presidential candidates have always published their tax data, even if the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration to check and call it the reason why Trump has not revealed his income information.
"The transfer is yours," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted referring to the Democratic candidate's tax information.
On Thursday, Trump’s Special Rights Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he will not allow Trump to disclose his tax information until the checks are done.
Trump’s critics, including Republican 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose the information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his contributions to charity, his business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has touched this question and posted a video on the internet on Friday in which he shows the Republicans in a visible position who are pushing Trump to publish his tax data.
On Thursday, Clinton spoke about the issue in a speech in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and does not publish his tax declarations,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to the Politico network, Trump did not pay taxes at all or only paid a little bit of two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be similar.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue in the presidential election.
According to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Clinton has supported a rule that would ensure that those who earn more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters in Berkshire Hathaway, headquarters in the same place, challenged Trump's meeting where they would both disclose their tax data.
Buffett said he was also subject to tax control and Trump was not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has published its tax declarations until 2007.
The Clinton, currently living in Chappaqua, New York State, paid the actual federal tax by an average of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40,5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax declaration shows that unlike the majority of Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and Clinton announced the dividend and interest revenues in the amount of $109,000.

Chili powder-filled elephant condoms support elephant protection in Tanzania
Nature Conservatives in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep the elephants away from human settlements – the elephants are hit by throwing chili powder-filled preservatives towards them.
The tool has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea a few years ago, has jointly launched a campaign with the U.S. Nature Conservancy to teach volunteers in northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and farms without damaging elephants.
A few years ago, the elephants were used for the emergency.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“The method we have developed has seen the attitudes change in these villages, as now the villagers can rely on being able to keep the elephants away from their shelves without damaging them,” Honeyguide Foundation’s chief executive Damian Bell said in a statement.
First, the penetrating elephant is stumbled by showing the pocket lamp and calling the tube.
If this does not work, the so-called chili is thrown.
The chili powder mixed in the salt is placed in the preservative together with the electrician, after which the head of the preservative is locked so that only the burning plate remains outside.
When the lighting plate is burned, the preservative explodes open and spreads into the air a fine chili powder cloud.
Usually, one steam cloud is enough to drive an elephant away.
The ultimate means is a shot that shots the lighting flame known as a Roman candle into the air and generates a loud and bright explosion.
A Jewish filmmaker criticizes a Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s directional number from the Arabs’ “threateness” – RT News
A French, rooted Jewish film director gave birth to a media shock after it was revealed that Berlin's Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not list Israel's route number in its land number list. The hotel employee quoted when asked Arab customers about the "products" coming.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, revealed his frustration over Berlin’s Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel’s list of guidelines for Israel.
However, this is not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it’t exist?”
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call to Israel through a separate call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes the reception officer's response shocked him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was "a decision carefully considered by the Kempinski hotel management."
The reason behind the action shocked the film director even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli route number."
In an interview with the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said the case was "a huge shame."
“The incident shocked and shocked us all.
It is a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and it’s just this hotel chain.
No further explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the ambassador said.
The incident caused a fairly opposite reaction on the web, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski hotel of simply giving up the alleged Arab customers' claims.
"Let's go" was said in one publication, showing the location of the hotel near the synagogue on the Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel has quickly denied the accusations, called it a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"A direct order to remove Israel from the route list was never issued," a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Hotel Kempinski said.
It adds that the direction number is then added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber products for Brazilian students' demonstrations
Students gathered with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to demonstrate their minds against the government’s public education system reforms.
Police used tear gas and rubber products against the protesters.
The bullying began when the law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student group, resulting in the use of rubber products and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration, who wanted to demonstrate their discouragement of the government’s plans.
The Governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has made a proposal for a savings measure, which will shut down almost a hundred public schools and invest 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, opposing the temporary president Michel Temer.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with dismissed President Dilma Rousseff’s favourite protesters when the country’s Senate voted on the official question.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71% – RT Business
The annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70,9 per cent, Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan said.
He said the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
“Russian companies will continue their existing relations with Iran while new companies are ready to come to the market.
Further growth in trade is of course one of the primary goals in the cooperation between countries,” says Dzhagaryan.
In the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
“In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 percent, to $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machines, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Embassy in Iran granted about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries with its citizens tourist in Russia.
And it’s not too brave to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, in turn, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotch Callum Skinner scored the brethren when winning the bicycle gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner fought the reputation in the men's team print at the Rion Velodrom yesterday after the British triangle defended the 2012 London championship.
Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner was in the role of the anchor he took from his landman from the Scottish Sir Chris Hoyl. The young man made the legend proud by thanking for the goals and attacking the victory from the New Zealand team considered a predecessor.
Britain won a surprise four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic goals.
And they repeated the trick after being ranked only sixth at the World Cup in London in March, despite Hoy had later left his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first tracker.
Hindu came up at the right time.
Also, Hoy's decision to end the competition left the gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man in whom the British coach believed and in whom they saw the potential he has now rescued.
Hindes, Hey with the championship four years ago won Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record in time-to-time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won the gold in a double match.
Hindes was still behind after his round, but Kenny struck the team's leadership that Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was changing the strategy in such a way that Hindes was driving the pace to calm the pace with a larger shift, thanks to which Kenny and especially Skinner were able to keep the pace.
Hoy followed him as a BBC commentator and reached the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the prize ranking.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow says: “I’m thrilled with the equation.
I try to do my best and to succeed.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it.”
After winning in 2012 in London, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to falling on the track intentionally due to a bad departure.
He later withdrew his speech, and the British competitors had no complaint.
This time there were no such problems associated with the sovereign win.
Hindes says: "The atmosphere was like London, all the British tickets slept in the sight.
Our team formed united in the last three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that the victory in the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten racing championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a meter of the progress that has been made in the last five months, the successful five days on the Velodrom are ahead.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hey's achievements and win three Olympic balls in one of the Olympics.
This would mean paying six gold metals and one silver metals for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on March 23 (a magical date for British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
In this case, the benefits would be the same as the benefits of Hoylla.
Kenny is competing in the next sprint, which starts today and resolves in three days.
Bolton's 28-year-old Kenny says: "At this moment I can only be happy with this.
Team competition is always the best.
You will enjoy the victory with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins another two gold medals, he must get the rider's value."
This was the day’s only medal competition, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four men's team race.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, made in London in 2012 and winning gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 22.42) will compete today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention is Wiggins.
He had a dispute with competition publishers yesterday before the time time when the publishers called him to measure his length.
In the match for women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavi reached the world record season 4:13.260.
The UK team can now rely on its powerful racing team to take responsibility for the middle stage of the Olympics and bring a set of medals to the country.
After the very extraordinary evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
The background has had dramas, the least of which is the resignation of the technical manager Shane Sutton in April in the middle of allegations related to sexism and temptation, and the end of the competitors of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first evening on the Velodrome show that the already legendary reputation of the United Kingdom rises to the peak at a perfect moment will be realised again.
The future of Portland's welding factory is on the scale due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of an aluminum power plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers, are in trouble when the power plant that supplies the power plant has announced that one of the factory owners is terminating the delivery agreement and is expected that all the delivery agreements will be terminated.
This is the result of the Victoria government’s decision earlier this year not to continue the support for the factory to be operated.
The fixed, 20 year-long support will cease in November.
The Alcoan Portland factory is at risk of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be in danger.
The snowball effect can continue to increase, as the welding plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity production in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry’s welding factory, which resulted in the England power plant being closed last year.
The Alcoan Portland slurry loses money and is at risk of closing its doors.
The measures match the speculations on the factory’s future for years, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently the factory’s production price.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum power plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other welding facility owners to terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the factory is a joint venture formed by Alcoan and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own the factory with minority shares.
AGL says it expects the production plant in Portland to continue to operate, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the welding plant will continue.
AGL says the agreements contain so-called protection agreements, which were scheduled to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months, so they end in 2017.
"As such, AGL expects contracts to produce revenue in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential yield effects on AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by strong future market prospects in terms of wholesale electricity market prices.
AGL says it has already lowered the value of the contracts by $187 million in its accounting “as a prediction for the termination of the contracts.”
According to Alcoan, the decision to terminate the contracts "not affects Alcoan ... the capacity to keep the welding station in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the welding station."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was scheduled to enter into force from November this year, although it still has to find out why it is now withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the poor economic situation in the area, analysts have been cautious about their estimates both from the welding plant in Portland, Victoria, and from the Tomagon factory near Newcastle.
AGL’s operational manager Stephen Mikkelsen said earlier this week in a speech to analysts that at the annual level Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
“If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant decline in demand on the (electric) market.
For us as a producer it’t be good news,” says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian TV star Kendall in September as Vogue's national filmmaker
The model belonging to the Kardashian-Jenner clan and his mother and manager, the fourth daughter of Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, pose in the famous September number in the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, which is Estee Lauder's advertising face and appeared in the Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Seeing my dog in a room that was full of my loved ones, I got tears,” Kendall wrote.
The publication of the film was followed by a strange (or just the style of the Kardashian series?), a scripted video showing all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar disorders Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favourite, the Kardashian program producer Ryan Seacrest) showing that they forgot their sister's film. The video ends with a classic turn: they were all planning their sister's surprise party.
It’s cliché, and it’s used in almost all the birthday periods of asten programs (Seacrest says the words: “Do you hear that we’ve forgotten you?” just as honestly as the child’s morning TV cartoon), but Krisin had to bring his other daughters in some way into this publicity.
The appearance in the Vogue September number is undoubtedly a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendall's grandmother Kim may have reached Vogue's appeal before (she appeared on Vogue's cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the newspaper's September number is quite its own class.
The September number is Voguen's most sold edition of the year.
In its thickness, a bigger picture book than a fashion page-like number attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashionist calculated that last year’s 832-page guide had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the number of September is expected to be so intense that in the previous two years the photographs of the newspaper have been revealed before the official announcement.
Earlier in September, they were named Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more famous models that work in the model than models that are famous ones.
The Oscar winner and Dior advertising figure Jennifer Lawrence was on the painting in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The newspaper describes Jenner as a model of success for his generation, and although he would be among the celebrities that make the model work, he is still in a pretty good companion.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, real TV stars or contemporary children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
They can reasonably be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry over others.
Last year, Beyonce has been behind one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of his true TV back, Jenner's role in the fashion world will always be a backdrop.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "frogs".
These feelings have rebounded the surface once the news of Jenner's appearance on the Voguen cover came out.
However, the continuous decline of dissatisfaction feels uncertain.
Kendall Jenner is the Vogu's September number model.
He is a supermodel, in the clearest sense of the word.
She walks at Marc Jacob's fashion shows.
She is the advertising figure of Estee Lauder’s makeup.
She and all of her sisters sell photos of themselves through paid apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she photographed for the LOVE newspaper.
And in his free time he appears on real TV, just as a way to meet his sister and his children.
Legal aid centers are displacing 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the country’s most vulnerable people are displaced from legal aid centers, and the sector is preparing for the impact that additional funding cuts will have on the centers already operating at the extreme level.
In the state of Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal assistance and lawyer services are dismissed – most of them are elderly, immigrants, poor workers, victims of violence and unjustified claims and similar injustice against people fighting without resources.
Public legal aid services, the workload of which is already overloaded, are preparing for additional reductions in funds.
From June next year, legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, Head of the Queensland Public Legal Assistance Centre, says that the latest accounting report by the National Organization of Legal Assistance Centers says that thousands of people are displaced from the centres each year.
If the federal government does not turn its decision, Farrell says the situation will only worsen.
"Queensland's public legal aid centers are constantly underfinanced, meaning thousands of people are dismissed when they apply for the necessary services they need," says Farrell.
“People who leave violent relationships, people who are under uncontrolled and rampant debt debt, families who are dismissed, unjustified workers who are dismissed – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of Queensland’s weakest people will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring the funding of legal assistance to the national middle level.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centers and their client counties, and the government of Palaszczuk has to invest in this important work.”
Donald Trump's campaign appeals for threatening a worker with weapons
New York: A lawsuit against Donald Trump’s campaign was raised after no action was allegedly taken after its leadership was informed that the campaign leader in North Carolina had threatened a worker with weapons while driving them on the Jeep in February.
The event is described in a lawsuit brought by former software trainer of the state campaign Vincent Bordini on Wednesday at the state court in Charlottes.
Bordini says he has been waiting months for the situation to be addressed within the campaign before he, according to his own words, realized that this would not happen.
Bordini said in his complaint that campaign leader Earl Phillip "he brought the pistol out, put his right front arm on the slope and pressed a stick on Vincent's knees."
According to the complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini was heard that at least four other people had the same experience with Philip.
“Even if the weapon does not shoot, it will cause damage,” Bordini said in his appeal.
The lawsuit comes only two days after the Republican candidate for the presidency caused public anger by saying to the crowd in North Carolina that “the supporters of the second additional paragraph” – considered to be owners of weapons and armed activists – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets the judges to be elected.
Trump’s campaign supporters said the media removed his speech from the context and Trump did not call for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation for indifferent leadership and compensation from Phillip for abuse, abuse and mental suffering that they have caused.
Trump’s spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a message in which he was asked to comment.
Phillip was not achieved despite the firms.
Charlotten’s local news agency WCCB that Phillip was soon leaving the campaign.
A call request to the Philips Consulting Company, Innovative Consulting Service, was not received an immediate response.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been on a controversial campaign.
Court case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic Spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in the local communities and London, but throughout the country.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all of our regions.
The Olympics produced huge profits for Stratford and East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for local communities, we will create 10,000 new employment and 40,000 new employment, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the airport neighborhoods.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think the expansion of Heathrow is too big challenge.
As for the Olympics, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in a disappointing situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong with Heathrow as well.
Overcoming obstacles are always faced, but Heathrow responds to every question asked by him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and grow the economy by 211 billion pounds. It brings knowledge and employment to both the airport environment and the entire UK.
We have a great work group with Heathrow, which has implemented a timely and budgeted 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment program, which included the T5 terminal – which has been voted for the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two of the world’s tightening highways.
Now they are ready to produce a third grate, supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It’s time for us to use the same Olympic sense for the Heathrow expansion to guarantee our trading future and create the knowledge and employment that the UK can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Heathrow’s chairman and former Secretary of Commerce at the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Ads on Cat-Mouse Cut
The efforts of companies earning their money from advertising to deceive advertising anti-software have turned into cat-mouse scratches, says one of the companies producing anti-software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it would block advertising anti-programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it said that users could update their block software filters and thus again block social service advertisements.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will change the advertising labelling codes on its desktop site to make it more difficult for advertising anti-programs to identify which parts of the page are advertisements.
Now Adblock has announced that it has discovered new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that "this bullying between the open-source advertising community and scammers has been ongoing since the advertising test was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own correction movement again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has participated in the struggle is a strong indication of how big concern advertisers have formed in the industry.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use advertising anti-programs, according to a study by PageFair and Adobe last year.
Every day, 1.03 million active users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile communications account for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to invest in the misconduct of advertising-blocking programs in its desktop app, as a spokesman says mobile-blocking programs don’t work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the bet to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it will update the advertising tool for user settings so that users can more control how advertisements are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters, as it says they also block some regular Facebook posts from viewing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we're going to solve the problem," Facebook's spokesman said in a email statement.
“Advertising control programs are narrow and ineffective, and that’s why we’ve invested in developing user settings like advertising tools so that people can control advertising targeting themselves.”
A woman committed suicide by leaving under cars on a Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking eyewitnesses for help on the motorway on Thursday after the first hours of the accident in which the woman deliberately left under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud's canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman made her desperate act by laying on a dark road, and several cars hit her, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Switzerland woman, and her attempt was clearly suicide.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified.
The lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneve that the criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the accusations against the drivers involved in the accident are raised.
Was it impossible to avoid the collision?
It remains to the prosecutor to find out,” says Hofstetter.
Over the past five years, there have been two similar cases that have resulted in the lack of responsibility for drivers.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked on a dark motorway and the court decided that the drivers could not wait to collide with their pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police was released from the charges that had been raised against him for death suspicion when he collided with a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had drinked a lot of alcohol and dropped on the road.
The court ruled that the police – who was responding to an emergency call – had reasoned driving and the man on the road was “a completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation.”
Anyone who knows about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model that allows the past of Venus to be studied with the same tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was intended to find out whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes be similar to those on Earth, although Venus is hot and waterless on its surface and its gas system is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to researchers, the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained by its thick gas frame.
On the basis of the latest simulation, however, it can be assumed that Venus had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and it has yet rotated slowly.
The model was also used to explore the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet is likely to have more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to maintain life and prevent rapid deforestation.
Early Venus was also benefited by the sun, which was 30 percent smaller.
“In the GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its day side is almost two months per day,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and generates rain, which creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like a shadow and protects the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, the global average temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model created the story of Venus, which corresponds to planetary scientists’ previous assumptions about its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans disappeared, and the ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
When the water crashed in space, only a thick carbon dioxide gas and a deadly greenhouse effect left – that is, the Venus as it is today.
The researchers the results of the new Venus climate modeling in the Journal of Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and vice-president of the team’s hockey action, calling on the lack of influence on the decision-making of the team.
Colorado’s Vice-CEO/CEO, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the team will immediately seek a new coach.
“In the last three years I’ve performed my job as the chief coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the Deputy Leader of the team’s hockey action with passion and determination,” the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
“Thro the summer, I have long and thoroughly thought about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to this, the coach and the vice-chairman of the hockey activity of the team must be fully in the same lines with the organization.
He must also have speech in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and we wish him all good for the future.”
Royl was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the Best Trainer of the Year for his first season as Avalanche Chief Trainer 2013-2014.
With his leadership, the team reached 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in drop matches and has not reached the subsequent period in the last two years.
Avalanche scored 39-39-4 in the 2015–2016 season and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card place in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame champion Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
Northern oil workers start negotiations and stop strike
The chief negotiators say the pay sanctions for the North Sea oil workers will be suspended as all the parties in the dispute will take part in the new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been held a strike in the North Sea-based, Royal Dutch Shell-controlled boring facilities.
According to a joint statement of the parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement on re-starting the process in order to resolve the dispute."
From the beginning of the next week, we will hold a number of day-long meetings over the coming weeks, where we will deal with the problems from fresh aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible up to 30 percent wages.
Due to the negative market pressure, Wood Group will cut tariffs on its North Sea entrepreneurs by approximately 9 percent this year.
The company’s tariff reduction follows the calculation of the prices of entrepreneurs working in the countries by 10 percent in 2011.
According to the company, additional cuts give it the movement that is necessary for it to cope with the market decline.
Shell, in turn, has dismissed thousands of employees and announced its plans to leave oil and gas production operations in up to 10 countries. Thus, it seeks to enhance its operations after its megafuusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower raw oil prices and the economic situation, which is the result of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union in June, create pressure on energy companies.
Scottish Parliamentary Deputy Dave Anderson met with the Labour Leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work shocks that has been experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
He said the North Sea is vital for the economy of the region.
“In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need a economy that will benefit many and not few,” says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016, with approximately $7 billion spent over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotating speed of the stars in the Plejades
The Kepler Space Telescope’s latest mission was to measure the rotation rate of the stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotation rate of the stars belonging to the Plejadic gathering.
Based on the new data, astronomers will be able to figure out why the stars of the same group of stars rotate at different speeds and how the rotating times are associated with the planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results with other star sets we will learn more about the relationship between the star’s weight and age and even its history of the solar system,” says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the University of Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The playoffs are located 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many of the stars are born about 125 million years ago, meaning they are just getting to their adulthood.
They are rotating faster now than ever.
When the rotating speed is at its peak, large amounts of adult stars disappear from the spacecraft.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars when they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of identifiable star clouds (equivalent to solar clouds).
The latest listed rotation speed data indicates that larger stars rotate slower than smaller.
The Rebull compares the stars to the dancers – the bigger rotates slower than the smaller.
“We see from the “dance” of the Plejad that slowly rotating stars are typically bigger, while the fastest rotating stars are typically very light,” says Rebull.
Because the Playoffs is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory that allows the properties of the stars to be compared in proportion to the rotation speeds.
“The Plage Star Team offers a support pillar for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars,” says Rebull.
We want to get much more information about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation and stop their "dance".
Rebull and its colleagues will present their latest analysis of the rotating speeds of the Plejad in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
