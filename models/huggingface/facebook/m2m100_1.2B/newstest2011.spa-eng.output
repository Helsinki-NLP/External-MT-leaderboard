The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the bakery.
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will seem to have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed ODS colleagues.
The period Aktuálně.cz "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to verify their knowledge of the slang marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The encoded dictionary that used Prague's political flower and nata during the previous period, by mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that the new councillors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least so they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
“The truth is I don’t know.”
“I’m rather a novice in Prague politics,” said Lukáš Kaucký, the councillor for culture, during the terminology examination of “college”.
And as for the veteran politician, Karel Březina reacted equally.
Per you know the concept of “golf hole.”
“Possibly it’s the only expression of all you’ve asked me what I use from time to time.”
“If not, I usually don’t use slang.”
From the glossary, whose definitions the newspaper Aktuálně.cz published last June before the ODS voting congress, the editorial board chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the bakery", "tour neck", "tradition of the capital" and "blinding".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth council, Petr Dolínek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get into these things or think of valuing how civic Democrats have fun."
“What I care about is how we will understand ourselves in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As has been seen, supposedly mayor Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" says nothing; the only term he hit in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s about the Blanka tunnel,” says Kaucký, who immediately adds: “But I know it from the news.”
“I’m going to have to go to a language course,” he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the council of the Environment Lukáš Plachý.
After that, both sociodemocrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery."
"I think it means going to a Prague company"; it soon reveals to Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge he obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the Social Democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
“I asked my colleagues, but really it doesn’t seem that we have anything like it.”
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we play words with names," says the president of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whose party counterparts call Hulda.
"At school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me so," says his nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party companions, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the elections deceit during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his comrades.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the social-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Porras" seems to recall that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law from the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", according to a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually of old age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
“Men rarely suffer like that.”
"It does not isolate healthy young women, because they help in work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the state of West Africa, Burkina Faso, is occupied in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure”.
He issued an informative pamphlet that should help prevent the witch hunt.
However, this has a trap.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read,” the newspaper Die Standard warns of the disadvantages of writing awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate cluster of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was stuck in the oil used for ritual anointings.
He set himself on fire when the group wanted to “expel the evil spirits” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “Human soul-eaters have always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to calm the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a widespread witch hunt that allegedly had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself using black magic."
“To help him he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly chosen men and women from the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
In the estate, the arrested people had to drink a pot of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay in the estate.
Following international pressure, some 1,000 detainees were finally released.
Bakala tenant: Heats up with coal-fired greenhouses and signs higher rental
The man, aged and smart, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the RPG company Byty of the "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-storey rental contracts: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is fulfilling his sentence.
Three of them are now in the process of lease liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the son will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-bedroom apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, he does not have hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows his finger in his son's new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But before that, man only makes an ademany.
“Everyone says something,” he said with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major laboratory for testing liberalization.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of the apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were until now under a regulated rental.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Just next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a numbering machine.
"Rental 2011" can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
By pressing it, a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you’re in the queue.
Soon after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as previously: arrangement requests, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of between 15 and 38 percent.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's running for a week, so it's beginning," replied, after doubting briefly, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and Bakala's old miners' floors are the most delicate issues in the area.
Prior to the elections, they were already treated loudly by the vice-president of the Parliament, Ostrava-born Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now appear continuously in the local newspapers.
“20 years later, I want a new ground.”
“I didn’t even change the damned dish of the bathroom,” the man mentioned in the introduction says.
According to the workers, at the moment more than nothing retired come to check if they get a discount on the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the discount on the February rental for the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15.
However, the window of mining “liberalization” does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked for the rental in 2011," the window store employee estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge must resolve the matter.
"It's not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and completely in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"Here no one is going to be judged," says one of the RPG employees Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives her, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 for food; I have no means to go to the courts," he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
“We will see.”
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people wait," he said.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rental.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with rentals invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.200 million.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The rental increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per month per square meter," it is indicated on the screen.
Only the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio increased by 38%.
“In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” RPG said.
At 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not hit rent, but will escalate between four and eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental rise (see chart) again in the floors, mainly in saving on heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need nursery
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with everything owned by such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can attend it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio numerous well-known buildings of Brno came out, thought from the early sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its minigarden.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying reduced hours, kindergarten is one of the benefits Arch.Design offers its employees as part of its social program.
Builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Designu employees themselves and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund under the Human Resources and Employment Operational Program, as well as from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the granted funding (a dotation of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), the company Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the minigarden in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day long for their care.
Since it is a "minigarten", it can only simultaneously accommodate a maximum of five children, although with turns they go more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-care program are comparable to the program of the usual preschool teaching.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and table games, but also a computer for the children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
Thus, Arch.Design ranks among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened personnel marketing.
The House of Bones still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lagoon, the stairs resemble the dinosaur’s column, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals dubbed it "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds of the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudí’s secession.
The cover of the house plays with onyrian lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought-out order is observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twist of the forms continue to surprise us also in its interior.
The wave wood copies the frames of the windows, the bars, the adornments of the doors, the mirrors and the signposts.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample neighborhood in number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the renovation of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
It was designed by the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
In fact, in his plans of the project appeared ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the façade.
In the facade also worked other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Park Güell de Gaudí, in which other pieces of it are found.
Due to its organic shape, the locals shortly after its completion dubbed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of the bushes".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motifs.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation respirators and the typical fireplaces.
It may seem strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the construction norms of the time at all and did not be influenced by them.
Still, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the municipality was so impacted with the result that it asked to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: only fifteen days after the request of the municipality, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
On the lower floor was the owner.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of the connection of space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate in this way smoothly, without giving up the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with the light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and rainbows.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and rechargeable apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous creator’s birth.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very profitable business and expanded the visits to the common area and the stove, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lagoon towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and somer: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to tumble, that is, the mattress and the somer.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented so that they can be adapted to specific users.
During the choice, numerous elements come into play, including the owner’s weight, height, health status and gender.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and the somer are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that doesn’t usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they “heat” more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more often.
If the channels in the center are not properly aired and, above, are on a firm base, they keep the moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, habits also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, tougher surface.
“Nearly all of the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their scratched shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who have nervous system problems, so they get poor information from the joints and skin," says Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You don’t have to be an NHL player anymore to be able to appreciate viscoelastics.
This “miracle” works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exercises pressure; during the night, it won’t turn like after a tough game.
It just sleeps better.
The viscoelastic also acts as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of around 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: by tumbling up, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk to the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert of Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérů, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years, a topic she teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own mattress and mattress, so during the purchase you should pay attention to combining the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the somers at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with interior fence a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that suits the shapes and smooth.
"When touching it with your hand or settling on the mattress, you should not notice the folds," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of somer.
Completely coated bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, don’t make sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can’t wash their foam, which is often done today.
And, given that every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congestioned) tamis.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that talk about a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
Everything has a pero.
Therefore, sellers give a tip: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully handle the cleaning and washing of the foam, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattresses with cremallera closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a somer, do you have a firm table?
and never !
As much for the beds designed to spend a night visitors.
However, you should make (if you don’t already have them) ventilation holes in the table and it should be used with a mattress with sockets inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with sockets in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable blades that contain between 14 and 18 blades, you can use latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although it is always better to use a blade with a greater number of blades, 28 or more, in which the lumbar zone blades are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articulable sheet mattresses should not be used with a mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the blades that allows you to press or even tilt the blades in such a way that they perfectly "round" the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "masculines", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross-structured or tablets with the so-called multitorsion amortization.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that, even if you use the right mattress and cushion, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mulled"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can be relaxed.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When tapping on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder reinforcer or the softest area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original palm-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are in fashion.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as ricinus or soybeans.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin,” explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress foam, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men “refresh” themselves with breeze vegetable extracts, so that the mattress foam absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to “heat” the foam.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warm.
Favorites at the moment?
The colours are made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and visco-elastic allow to manufacture mattresses of various zones that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as sanitary means.
The first to get this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and somers.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the foam for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is obtained for free.
The era of viscoelasty with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
It originally appeared as a material for NASA, because during the takeoffs many astronauts were subjected to an enormous overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Consequently, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use the foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially intended for the tracking of vehicles, can also track the movement of people and contribute thus, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment, the device is approximately the size of a light bulb box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anička and began to report on the available means to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading your privacy.
"We're all trying to tell ourselves that it's not about spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone’s pocket without their knowledge, but we haven’t yet stumbled upon such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even younger children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.”
"Before, parents relied enormously on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In their opinion, it is questionable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always check if the child carries any kind of electronic device that can reveal his or her location.”
“Now is the phone.”
“As the use of tracking devices spreads, they will also look for them, since their sale will be done with a lot of advertising.”
“In such cases, the offenders are always one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even in the event that, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve as a help.
"You can configure the device to regularly send the position after a certain period of time."
"If he suffers damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The more expensive devices have an integrated slope meter, so if the person simply slides and stays immobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says Čech.
In their opinion, a service of this type can even be obtained with smart phones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a light bulb box or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, that’s why tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or that he identifies him after a certain time, which can make the police make time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough meches to surround all of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army purchased 445 kilometers of mecha to capture explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the mecha is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive mecha from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha by saying that the soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of mecha a year.
According to the calculations of the army's pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is however decided that, in such a case, such manoeuvres should be carried out with frequent use of explosives each year and all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr nor Army Captain Vlastimil Picek wanted exemptions.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army would spend sixty kilometers of mecha.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if that were the case, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade personally complained recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even the practices of shooting for money are limited.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
“I also don’t get to understand that we are being bought repeatedly such amounts of mecha.”
“But it’s their decision and they’ll undoubtedly know why they act like that.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that, as a company, we try to satisfy,” admits STV Group Commercial Director Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of mecha and says it will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, of STV Group, indicates that the mecha only has a service life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its service life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he obtained a discount.
"It cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," said Pejšek, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry's shopping center.
Just for comparison: the annual mecha consumption of the police pyrotechnics, which remove the ammunition of World War II or that left by the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always only ask for the right amount to exhaust the ammunition before its service life ends.
They decided for safety reasons for the pyrotechnics and, in addition, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of mecha can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties to finish tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the two hundred thousand-man Czechoslovak army was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem with the current one will occur: hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now being bought "cheaply", will have to be removed.
I still live on the contacts I got through the contest.
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of his hotel franchises.
On the last edition, the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" won the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story is taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad, he realized that in Liberec quality accommodation was needed at a good price.
With the savings he met with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan he bought a five-storey house that was half ruined.
Given that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of accommodation in our area has prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began to rent the first reconstructed floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has been able to gradually open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the number one entrepreneur last year.
“To this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped to a great extent the fact of winning the competition for the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’,” adds grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” she recalls.
I would definitely recommend everyone who wants to try some company to participate in the contest.
But consider that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He says he still lives on contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he’t have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I started collaborating regularly."
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
Around 70 in total.
“I’ve seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has gained general recognition.”
"It's not, much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
“It is only my name that appears on the front page,” Lukáš Pytloun modestly says today.
I wish my successor a more peaceful year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner’s hard work, it is possible that Farmet has already experienced the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone’s “Company of the Year” contest, last year at the “Slavic House” in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and enhanced our confidence in fighting the competition,” says the winner last year.
The history of the company Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žďárský’s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned from his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his plastic battery father.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained greater presence among non-specialized audiences after achieving success in the media contest.
“Not only did our customers begin to consider the Farmet brand considerably better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
Last year was not just a demonstration of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also gained recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, partially, from 2009.
2009 was the hardest year for machine sales.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"Of course, we are not free from such a situation either."
"Income decreased by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must, sometimes, take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company’s profits, though at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut spending was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained excellent reviews at national fairs,” says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have left the crisis behind.
Revenues are increasing again and with them the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a more calm atmosphere,” says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that uncovered ridiculous rules
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already eliminated some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurd Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one-third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration asked for a trade register extract, although its officials can get it with two mouse moves.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for a trade register extract when it carries out a check of the insured's charges," Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for ČSSZ, said.
The aim of the Absurd Survey of the Year is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, he participates in the business tournament of the Hospodářské noviny publication and also begins to create affection among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it virtually reached four thousand.
And it’s not surprising, since we still have several overwhelming legal obligations that need to be respected simply to trade.
"Per in the number of papers needed for tax returns we are in the first place in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplifying business rules has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in the 74th position, that is, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurd of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the competition organizer selects seven candidates for the "antipremio" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurd who gets the most votes.
More than a hundred were submitted for this year’s survey, including 105 rules and regulations that don’t make sense.
The examples sent them both entrepreneurs as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the “finalists” of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint the walls every two years.
The list of the 70 proposals this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the contest, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which political and social personalities often participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended this competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot beined if the state continuously blocks entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year at least thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not go into drunkenness.
In 2007, what bothered people most was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate with a three-day notice to the business office of the permanent operation area, the intention to go with a job to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was removed in the law of the so-called green card.
The third is the winner.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two floor basics.
This year, the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the competition for Hospodářské noviny is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the contest Rebelde of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of Vodafone’s 2010 Main Contest, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between one and the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is, for example, disabled people, in another, personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from across the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor of funds for sponsorship of disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paper shop that is especially concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; that is why it received the title of responsible company in the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the year competition it finished third in the region.
In Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded to him because he purchases priority from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The leading IT company Enlogit of the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
“In addition, we support the Persona in trouble scholarship, which helps the local Roma community in particular,” said Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
They also place in a good place with a mention the laundry company Praní a čištění of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that impact on their pension funds.
“We give benefits in food, transportation, skills improvement and leisure,” says Josef Strapáč, of Bruntál Czasch’s construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest who answered the questions in the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August were automatically designated.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were incomplete or incorrect.
"If the representatives of the contesting companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition for the Responsible Company of the Year, but are not disqualified from the competition "principal" Vodafone Company of the Year."
“Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the Main Company of the Year competition,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agriculture Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have carried out several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives married a local media businessman and real estate businessman Luboš G.
It appears that he attempted to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of the rights in such a way that the auctioned land would be received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public bidding," Antonie Zelená, the chief prosecutor of Pilsen, told Právo, adding that at the moment it can't disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How he could influence the public auction, given the little official information, can only be speculated.
Lubomíra Černá, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Fund, responded to Právo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
“It’s a client, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of proposals for land transfer in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when several stakeholders appear in relation to the offered land.
“These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced.”
“On the basis of the offers, the order of buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the largest offer,” the spokeswoman of the Fund explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to be presented to the call and, since he was also an interested party because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to the interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
For that reason, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on it.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He appeared in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund some planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular on the site where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Afterwards, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic centre of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the municipality had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay several hundred crowns a month.
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw from the portfolio, from January, several hundred crowns a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should be about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production, photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is heated moderately, especially when heating is used more and therefore the consumption is higher.
In this case, they also have to count on a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are charging across the country, the change in central heating price varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay more than 50 crowns per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, praguenses will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are currently among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
They could significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rental by up to 100% from January.
The company will bring to court those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year by up to 10 percent.
The young Czechs are drunk with Fernet and rum.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up in the hospital continuously to overcome the resaca are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in the hospital's pediatric admissions.
Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk.
“Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages,” says Luděk Pelikán, head of pediatrics at the Hořovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia.
“When they catch a bottle of whisky to their father, it may be whisky, but it’s usually Fernet and vodka.”
“Wodka has the advantage that it’s ally with juice and that it doesn’t smell so much,” she explains.
This was confirmed by Motol University Hospital spokeswoman Eva Jurinová.
“Normally, it’s usually Fernet or Ron.”
“These are modern alcoholic beverages, among schoolchildren.”
"In some cases, they use watermelon they picked up at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, drunkards between the ages of thirteen and fourteen are the ones who usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics at Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
“A girl had to enter maybe four times.”
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought with 3.5 of alcohol in the blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor said.
"He was at the fair of Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, we cannot speak about dependence.
“Alcoholic is a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.”
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," says Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in the Motol pediatric clinic, forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who go with severe intoxication and need to stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after ambulant medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply gather after school and drink water, there are three seasonal highlights to mention for Pelikán: Witch Day, Year's End and the end of school.
"In such circumstances, they drink for bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
“On Witch’s Day, I’ve seen up to seven drunk children in admissions at a time,” Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible rash at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by the injection of a serum with glucose and the nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"These do it much better, because after the busy night, they get up well and it doesn't hurt them."
“They are only confused about where they are,” Pelikán says, adding that, often, patients lose their mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes to cost a dozen thousand crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job so that you earn enough to pay for that night," Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in his opinion as a regressive measure, which usually returns people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159s for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159s out of a total of five, by which the Czech Defense Ministry replaced the Casa C-295M, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that such a device is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad to carry out practice or demonstration flights.
The L-159T1 was used by the Czech Army and was still in flight.
The three remaining planes are the L-159 monoplaces.
These are still preserved at Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took over them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defense press department, says it is not yet known when the aircraft will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
“The L-159 monoplace aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired a long time ago, without any additional investments or contributions from the Ministry.”
"The L-159T1 were exchanged in their current state," Pejšek told Právo.
He added that the army did not remain without biplace aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a sum of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 aircraft for biplaces.
One of the new aircrafts was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to adding the aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that EADS is the company that will withdraw the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call for a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management says the exchange promotes future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa aircraft and the latter should arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the anular finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the anular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can constitute a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, for men up to the age of 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at the University of Warwick.
Consequently, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, in particular whether this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed with a British counterpart more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right-hand index finger shorter than the anular.
They had the same chances of developing prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that he does not think the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be "completely demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was covered with snow on Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are covered mostly by compact snow and snow removal machines circulated throughout the night through numerous areas.
In the morning, the D5 road between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and passenger cars, as well as the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
A truck crashed on Kilometre 91, and two industrial vehicles crashed on Kilometre 93, causing injuries.
Several passengers also ended up in the crash.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
There two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive slowly after Brno on km 190 or cross Brno and get on km 182 in Kývalce.
There have been several kilometres of blockades.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road, just next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Stakes are forming, for example, in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congestioned.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trains are delayed, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
Problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyně airport was closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, you can already drive on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed, in Brněnska snow languages are forming and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain highways.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Up to now, the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To remove them, freezers will be required.
It is not yet known when it will be opened to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, given that it is a protected natural area, should simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the layer of snow reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snow falls gradually in the Czech Republic.
US soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is employing in Afghanistan a new “smart” weapon, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that it will "change the progress of the game" to make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol with an extremely accurate punch.
The bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25-mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually function like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trinch.
Certainly, you can’t use normal protection and, when you throw your killer rain of metal sticks, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"Soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of sight and, according to it, corrects the projection line and squeezes the trigger."
“Let’s say 543 meters have been measured.”
“When the trigger is pushed, the weapon loads and throws the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus less one, two or three meters,” Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will move their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance industry giant said on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad neighborhood in Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees from the consortium, who were previously spread across the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner stated, “In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The bright connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt’s head of the economy department, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has earned a “Global Player.”
This is a “great recognition of the location.”
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The headquarters informed the city of their intention.
“Of course we have offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons caused the decline.
Thus, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and the tenant of the building will show cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu on the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" formed part with the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial resort city construction project.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the municipality, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of mass building that previously used holes as parking spaces and as to the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment advisory and pricing companies, the manufacturer of software for booking systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then merged Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has most in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries here will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twentieth years, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server: threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is becoming increasingly upset.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it is political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, isly detained in England.
WikiLeaks’ disclosure platform is always the blank of criticism, increasingly strong in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for a home for the Internet in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted people, should remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
WikiLeaks removed from Amazon’s server
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations communicated via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Earlier, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service web to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
Wikileaks tweeted: “Perfect, we’re going to spend our dollars to hire people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server through WikiLeaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman requested investigations, CNN in a call to Lieberman's office.
The chairmanship of the Senate Security Council for the country had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian.
"I wish Amazon had taken these measures sooner, before previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks," he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and reckless process of WikiLeaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is sought in Sweden for rape, is on Interpol's search list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot of his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
“There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange.”
That’s why they fear for Assange’s security, Hrafnsson said.
The location of the founder of Wikileaks remains unknown.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has claimed that the man responsible for the WikiLeaks disclosures should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, a counselor to chief government Stephen Harper said, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should "be murdered" and Obama could "use a drone".
There is a huge dispute between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked for the resignation of the secretary of state, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Anti-Terrorism Center, has been appointed an exceptional commissioner, the White House said.
So Travers is responsible for developing "important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of the Wikileaks leakage.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change all government information and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of WikiLeaks.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to help protect them if necessary.”
University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, refrigerators are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future freezers has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
The ice cream and the ice cream.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The gelataio pulls the cream of the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, stretches it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But those who want to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future freezers has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more extra-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and practices at the home’s own ice cream shop.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a refrigerator in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Master refrigerator Luciano Ferrari subsequently explains to participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation nor the nata cover of the national and mainly southern country’s top house: “Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that’s why every ball has something romantic.”
The first step in the process seems easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine cage and a pasteurized white base cream comes out, the basis for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that you disregard the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only from natural ingredients," has probably used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar rubber, from guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only have to buy it a day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients those that are purchased in the fruit section or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
There are dust and pasta.
“All suppliers will try to paste flavored ingredients into their goods.”
“But you have to try it someday.”
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will turn into a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the freezers.
Luciano allows them to make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and oatmeal, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They do the same experiment also with fruit ice cream types.
That you know better does not necessarily depend on having more tofu aroma or more fruit puré.
It is not necessary for oatmeal ice cream to know dry fruits, if it contains more oatmeal.
The working group elaborates the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less of stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, Luciano says.
The manufacture of ice cream is a problem of arithmetic: It is used the puré of melocotone with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano pulls out a tool with which he fixes the amount of sugar from the types of fruits (measurement of the vinicultor for Oechsle on the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the accounting.
Making ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic preparation of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to temperature below zero.
Despite everything, all automation is left out as far as the small paste is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puré, as if he were a gigantic minipremier without control.
“In all courses,” says Master Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time for something like that to happen.”
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry that experiments with GM plants.
Currently, this issue is formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of EFSA’s group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert have also been hired for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly on EFSA’s standards for testing genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The provisions of EFSA are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
So, recently, an EFSA senior manager went without the support or transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which conducted the Environmental General Officer as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from the industry, is used, as long as they are of high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But you have to expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others, for the risk assessment for biotechnology without the Lobby’s commission.
In this regard, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” says Then.
Current practice consists in verifying only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
“If the risks are not sought, how will they be found?” asks the accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck says the same.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this field, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
Trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilograms.
Monday was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind.
There were demonstrations
and Nevada.
The story is well known: In September the excavators arrived and began to smash a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never again became the same: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was torn apart.
It rotates in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rugged soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A few pieces have been secured.
“These stones are relics.”
“They should not disappear.”
He is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He does not yet know what he will do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trace of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition warehouse, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, they would grind the grille or send it to the garbage dump," says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing to the demolition company.
He spoke with the enemy of the 21st for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Around 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram slice cut, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold a long time ago.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, in charge of projects.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
“If it wasn’t for the political component.”
He ascends to his all-terrain, makes a tour of his great 20 hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally works with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It contains 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures throughout Germany.
It is said to be the largest treasurer of ancient stones in the country.
and Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstone picks.
“They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge,” he explains.
Calice dawn, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
“My dear stone.”
The road crosses the forest.
Note a lot: Red Sands, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
and continue .
“Good travertine.”
Formerly the carpets belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tower from the Heilbronner hospital.
What an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he first sculpted the stones and moved them with a simple apparel and a chariot, he feels very devoted.
“It would be a scandal if something was destroyed.”
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people had to do the stone trader, as well as pedestrians, a sculptor, a ferrer, a glass maker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfactory,” says the man who takes care of the remains.
Soon you will have to go to Colombo.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent Struggle around Great Potentials
There is an active influence in the buffet.
16 students gather around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Its mission is to hire students with the most talent from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and be hired by others.
And because universities do not provide publications about the skills of their students, they try to attribute exceptional talents to practical projects and capture them.
On the second project day at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins talent.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, blades and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to young talented students the internship programs and student jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can get to know students, look closer at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
“The main point previously was in technical projects,” says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not that they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students of the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering jobs in October.
And, according to the VDI forecasts, this engineering gap will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes costly hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through the GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can view KPMG’s subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the creme of the creme of many participants goes to the US.
Universities are increasingly struggling to select and polish the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
“With the race we want to highlight the mass.”
“The simple journey by itself was short.”
For Dykta, the notes give results.
"Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
“Some are close to their end, and want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized, classic with their work fairs.
“We try to get students to specialized fairs.”
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to fill the vacancies.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
“Professors advise that you can practice with us or do your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
This is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can normally not offer it,” says Stübe, the staff manager.
When looking for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child care or good opportunities for ascension.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld ranks 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager, also expects extra points in her ranking for her aspirants to work.
“I think the applicant is especially fixed on the external classifications of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Give your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, primarily internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the industry, it is called internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the staff.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with a gang,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and with it unleashed its previous plans in an inapelable manner.
Also on the Atlantic coast remain new drilling forecasts for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What provoked this strict ban, which will be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that cost the lives of eleven workers and provoked the biggest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters thus wanted to reduce the U.S. dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
Until now, it has not been entirely clear who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An investigation commission commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium following the explosion.
Subsequently, various petroleum consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using harsher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which after being accused of corruption has fallen into discretion, is being reformed.
In parallel, Obama announces that lucrative fiscal gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, so far.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake to the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current poll conducted by consulting firm BDO – ahead of the mining ban on Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are soon prolonged, at the expense of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The river water is oil marble, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of spilled raw oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist reassures reporters: “Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
Before here, I picked up gambas in handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was spilled into the formidable wetland by a broken pipeline.
The fish from the surrounding small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach waters filled with fish: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonilandia, is considered one of the world’s hottest regions.
On the way through the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, whoever submerges his hand in the water, will draw some fills of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark palms of gifts, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain they look for flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with the smell of a gas station expands in it.
"What's happening here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
This is the battle comparison.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a ripped battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers stormed more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the Shell consortium had to place its first factory in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogonilandia is prohibited: While they were pumping daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms stood out like water sculptures: “Christmas Tree” carelessly called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them present a total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari thinks, then a steady jet of oil runs into the water.
According to the experts' estimates, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the crash of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the biggest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see crumbling heads and leaked pipelines as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards usually in the conventional world, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the piping defect rates are "about a multiple greater than elsewhere."
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears a workshop filled with oil under the open sky, figures arise from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered over the ground, flames a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is heated on fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipeline drops and finally diesels come out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-litre diesel per day: "We get 34,000 naira", around $ 22.
Inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and inexpensive price of diesel at just 40 euros-cent per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which hijacked the pipeline network that passes through Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day in the entire Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant portion of stored provisional raw material is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, to which also belong politicians and senior military officers, store the best portion in aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is due to the handling of the population or to the loose mode of production to be purely academic.
“If oil companies didn’t behave like invaders and hadn’t completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the Ogoni conditions are crushed mainly by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: “Maybe it’s better to present another nationality, like China.”
Michael becomes nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular Ölmann.
“Soldiers can come in any minute.”
If the army’s special unit catches up the illegal refiners, it doesn’t threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This condemned invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari says.
Investigators detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation into a machine that carried out a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which could lead to “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Qantas has filed a lawsuit against the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than one can imagine: Australian air safety authorities have noticed, thanks to their investigations, a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a hose connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused a “catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 aircraft.
The Qantas-Airbus was forced to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has initiated legal measures against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court of Sydney that enabled more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
On the engine brand have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the accident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will conduct more safety tests on the superbugs equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on land.
Lufthansa has removed an A380 engine as a precautionary measure.
This double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A snowfall across the country creates chaos in traffic
All-white Germany: From day to day it has snowed almost all over the country.
On many streets reigns chaos, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost all over the country frozen temperatures were reached during Thursday night, which has triggered traffic chaos in many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most motorways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the skyscrapers are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong winds barrel the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water levels 1.2 meters above their usual level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on the highways and on the national roads.
According to meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are responsible for rolling it down.
Lots of cars and trucks were caught overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt police authorities major disorders on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created congestion.
In Turingia, snowstorms affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major disruptions are expected in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, falling trees on the lanes or crushed catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Turingia an ICE train had to stop his trip to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service treated the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds barred the streets.
In the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspension.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center in Munich, some cancellations have already been announced.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The shuttles are in continuous operation.
However, there are few barred passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 campsite beds prepared for them.
On many streets, there were many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred due to the snowed streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
In the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning her car near Aschaffenburg on a sliding road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be more and more smooth and dust-like and therefore will rush into gentle cracks.
The wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will definitely continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers in its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring up to 500 million euros.
Recently, Deutsche Bank settled its headquarters: The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district were modernized; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium appears to want to take advantage of the costs of the reconstruction, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" says based on a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
“We always check whether it’s worth owning the properties or selling them and then renting them again,” he said.
This is why Germany’s largest credit institution has resigned from its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for €272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms amounted to approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold on a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been revealed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were thought dead after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies have not been found, as security measures are still precarious at the scene.
Almost two weeks ago, an intense explosion occurred at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the site of the disaster, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue equipment was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Families and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining sunshine at Greymouth on New Zealand’s southern island.
They remain silent for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, underneath clothes and surfboards.
The flags waved at half-stage in front of the government buildings.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand government president John Key told the participants of the commemorative event.
“But they never went home.”
He can’t assume his son’s death until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative act.
In the first explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
The devil, the warrior!
Does the gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when shooting “Walhalla Rising”?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torters and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounding ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies off the trips of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no word throughout the film and the other characters are left to be carried by as much as one or two phrases or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather, it is ideal for filmmakers who are grown up and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a pity that they cannot exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy on the drug-trafficking haircut "Pusher" to be a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with something more of humor in the mainstream or something less of the brutality of the art house.
A brainstorming mass and trips that breathe can’t discourage most of the artistic film fans.
Most of the action fans die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and is stuck for an eternity in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and again silence there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody façade, a piece of sometimes exciting cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a movie.
There is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is condemned to just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the loud soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a little young blonde, who supports Unoyo faithfully, retains something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for provisional enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents destruction, but only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, altered and surprised.
and an experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on the issue until controls are allowed.
On midnight from September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with North Korea's help in the cube, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. CIA’s international intelligence service of late April 2008, a current reactor under the name of the proximity of El-Kibar is designed very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
In contrast, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
It was not long ago that the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was still not equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later from the bombing, it is barely more known that at that time, the puzzles grew bigger with time.
The former U.S. president, George W. Bush, recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was completely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in El-Kibar, but that he barely saw signs that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several intelligence agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a “suspected reactor,” although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible.”
They lack solid evidence, as does the OIEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer that the IAEA has “sufficient material to have questions.”
The Syrians quickly removed the debris of the alleged “unused military building” and swept the ground to conscience.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial sellers in the moments just after the attack, which should have a greater informative value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always made it clear that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as inverosymile after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter, as well as the satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also kept a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not given results since June 2008 and "progressively turns into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds with a place in the OIEA in Vienna, it is finally pending a serious infringement against the treaty of non-proliferation of atomic weapons, which the OIEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which should be "functionally connected" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed what equipment they are dealing with, or what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA has designated as internal Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits entry to all three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert about the equipment thanks to the warnings of the U.S. secret service.
By means of satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three locations and the cube on the edge of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," nor of uranium enrichment or re-conditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
Reactors are powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable trails that can be recovered, are in the three places.
As the hundreds of cargo trucks disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometers from the Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, unlikely, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements at the three alleged suspicious sites and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be coincidence, but it hardly helps dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter does not have much urgency, since a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a kind of U.S. ambassador, strikes the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that Vienna nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: It requires a majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries there represented are not precisely eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat thought, “And what if at the end they find nothing?”
Love in Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her debut yet unnamed.
She herself wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women’s associations have protested rapidly, with which in the last moment they moved some days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victim organization wrote to UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ambassador, a Bosnian newspaper.
It’s not diplomatic, weeks ago women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no love stories in the rape fields, and Jolie’s position about it delats the victims enough about the script.
Her organization in accordance with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended removing Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted behind a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie didn’t go despite it all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, introduces herself with much effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
The content remains inaccurate.
In the network circulates a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and come back to meet when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with a torter".
It’s certain that Jolie’s movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Currently they can make peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far away from here
This is finally a good day for the Irish.
No trace of suffering
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans scream of joy as the music rings out loud, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in Southern Irish Cork, because players throw, and find, pingpong balls to beer glasses from a distance of three meters.
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this strafy drinking game and the discreet computer really don’t do good stuff.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminant question, what the future will give him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
“It’s very far from home and I still have no work there.”
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor outlook at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
The young go: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, predict economists and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
In 2015, there were 200,000 immigrants.
A huge loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, there is a migratory wave comparable to the one the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses especially the young, well-trained Irish, for whom, until now, everything is costly.
Employment loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
Three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: “In Ireland everything is sinking.”
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes away and loses our country and with it a whole generation."
“The last one to close the door.”
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future appear because the government is only engaged in assembly and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your colleagues go from unrecorded practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
“This idea is sad and depressing.”
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the “WorkingAbroadExpo”, a trade fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
On his website appear photos of a boy practicing surfing in Australia and another practicing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O’Donovan knows what it’s like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
They are now building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to be able to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” she says, since it’s been a long time since she first crossed the threshold of her home.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I’m never so good.”
He laughs somewhat ashamed and goes through frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a loan.
“There were crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with your credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the complaints he often hears nowadays.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island,” he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let go of the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He’s already worked a couple of years in London and why didn’t he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him overwhelmingly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears he can degenerate in a farewell party.
“Only, not too many emotions,” he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
“Goodbye, it sounds very upsetting.”
"Better we call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is worse than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows for a follow-up of attitude changes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in various South American Pacific coastal countries (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a large drop in production last year.
However, only half of respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
Around 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than 25% recorded in 2001 (Chart 3).
Around 34% said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45% their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has remained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that numerous Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32%.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem their country faces (see chart 5).
Around 31% say they or a close relative have been a victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has decreased from 38% last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
More positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, compared to only 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela think the same (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that has the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (from 18% last year), followed by the United States (from 9% last year) and Venezuela (from 9% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the rubbish
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than they feared foreigners trying to help the country recover from its problems.
Votes were introduced to the polls, some people voted several times, paperboards were thrown in the tapestries, electoral colleges destroyed, and acts of intimidation.
Electoral schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the top U.N. official in Haiti, said the elections were “relatively good in many ways.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that “we do not think that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which its opponents say is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The departure is expected to take place in January.
All hope has not been lost in the election.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who barely has support, if he has any, has passed to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is ravaging the country and more than a million of the earthquake survivors are still living in shops, a large abstinence is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There is a lot at stake.
Donors consider the election of a popular and legitimate government an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as has remained obvious, the Haitians themselves also think so.
Moving from point to center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity index by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level it has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite all this, whether she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the next year’s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
At this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to be in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drafting budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, the government of Ms. Fernández lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner passed away from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have confronted Ms. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputies kicked another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to next year, which will give the president an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the salary demands of trade unions, place it close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and forced the INDEC, the statistical institute, to adapt official inflation statistics.
Will the President of the Republic of Serbia moderate these policies?
He has called for meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, their officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth momentum achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Per this is why Ms. Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a forced prior restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Currently, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner always insisted that this would not involve oversight by the IMF, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would offer "technical assistance" to elaborate a new national consumption price index, which seems to be the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term of office ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If she wants to win other elections, she will have to decide whether to calmly reject many of her husband’s policies or not.
Half Hurra for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, went on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a defender of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been inclined for total independence from Taiwan, received virtually 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes in his party has decreased by around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD matched the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections were seen the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and lightweight girls in clothes dancing.
There was also a mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly into the face, wounding him and killing a passenger.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says PPD leader Tsai Ing-wen, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and provoking voters to bow to the KMT.
Per the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Consequently, the KMT often avoids advertising its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided encouraging feelings against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma claimed that his policy with respect to China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
Beijing’s government is expected to continue plundering them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back to the roof.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, he would like to political integration as well, but the first is the first.
It would be best to wait until the 2012 presidential elections pass for that.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as the PPD presidential candidate, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to demonstrate that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s rushed approach to China.
Mr. Chen looks angry at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for the presidential elections.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also do a conscientious examination.
Mr. Ma’s ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have refused to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be due mainly to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will restructure its cabinet, as well as local teams.
Large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan’s support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of no return has already been crossed.”
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Revelation Artist.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the grammy’s surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Revelation Artist.
Taking into account that Spalding has been an acclaimed figure of jazz since his 2008 album, Hope, the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammy standards according to which he must be an artist who has not taken out more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of said artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was undoubtedly a big breakthrough and, considering his lightweight and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythms influences, one can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the path to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer’s “Historicity” Trio, an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer’s competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with “Moody 4B” and keyboardist John Beasley for “Positootly.”
Trombone Shorty, a favorite strider in New Orleans and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which by the rest is inclined considerably towards fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk gained a well-deserved recognition in the category of large bands, competing against the big camera jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bassist in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Classical Album Direction
Classical music nominations for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concert.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories that include orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classical Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
Nominated for the classic music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" from the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed “Los Angeles” and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for it to be played in mandolin Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestral role category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky’s works.
The nominees include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets the approval of the planning commission
The mosque project for Temecula has obtained unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and blockades.
However, members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahá'ís, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center in the valley of Temecula, said on Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They talk very loud.”
“There are wonderful people in this valley.”
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted virtually until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who interceded in favor or against the center, virtually the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
“The United States no longer exists,” read one of the comments.
"It's another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centres have provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the Zero Zone, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks occurred.
In the Valley of Temecula, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of 135 families has been cohabiting smoothly in Riverside County for years, but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and raise up to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project before the municipal council.
A microbe resistant to arsenic poses the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that it is possible that there are life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
It has a double capacity.”
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it something very peculiar, although it lacks little to be a kind of really 'alien' form of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Thursday's Science publication.
For a long time, it has been considered that there are six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets different from Earth, given that researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a lot of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He did not.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to drive their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s astrobiology institute, who led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has elevated levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar chemically, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one by another.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, it can be difficult for organizations to differentiate them."
"H, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, in some way, appeals to the biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact of demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead poses the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic can exist naturally, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an auxiliary professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but there was never an example to prove it works.
Arsenic was most common in the early epochs of Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“It suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in ancient times,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton
The two missing dogs from the four stolen dogs have been found in front of the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials said on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Welsh Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, officials said.
Two of the dogs recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
“The good news is that the dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
“They have returned with their legitimate owners.”
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
“We are following a trail.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff’s assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek planned to exhibit in the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days ahead of the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the almost two-month tour the couple performs participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer breed, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany), who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and would be fresher.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, endowed with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM's restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to clear approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and TV shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to rise under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a small studio.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which in turn is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to give advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial tribulations and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to sell the company.
However, the auction attracted a few applicants and none were willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors sought.
Before the spring of this year, it returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper’s companies will receive multi-billion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a “success fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual pool of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns roughly 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to balance their budget for gifts
While the iPad is the top candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by Microsoft’s Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant boost in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bicycles each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jumpers adorned with accounts, or approximately 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s technology toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s one.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with affiliated websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button-powered toys are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and older) are peluche toys the size of a dwarf who sing a note when their belly is squeezed.
One striking equals a note, and a second striking begins to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to squeeze, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and over) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-changing games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative articulated wheeled legs with a locking device.
The kids who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a ride into a session with a notebook of occurring self-correction exercises.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smartphone, here you will save three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major upgrade of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, from 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game barely larger than a flash box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by placing the blocks in a row before time ends; it’s formidable for an improvised word army competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at the Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, from 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include wheeled skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the pig of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of microrobots powered by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 vibrant silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side ofining order is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage on a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corpulent policemen of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their capricious vigorous measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
“The firms!”
“Attention to you!”
Show them, he whispered, “How beautiful the girls are!”
Four girls who barely spent their teenage years wearing white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants fitted to attract attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue-and-white stripe moulds.
“Personally, I think they have a normal appearance,” Mr. Tang said, contemptuously.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clear the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered that all new recruits have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the gray green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating gazes: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officials surrounded a chunky basket of snacks, and watched it with the cranks constantly for half an hour, until the wandering seller picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, expressly chosen by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the dull police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle to increase China’s slightest respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province struck a passenger after using their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the internet, describing how to effectively strike off criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a walking sandwich seller from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a rift with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, shows inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street sellers.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” China Daily, a national newspaper, lamented last year after another tactical controversy.
The newspaper demanded “a really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had real duties or were simply a scene distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s notice asked for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial traits.”
They should have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the job was physically too hard for women over 25.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
“First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial traits, etc.”
Then comes the temperament “and the inner qualities.”
Female chengguan are like florists, he said, and added, “besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to endorse that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job announcements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial traits.
If this means being a bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
The disabled or defigured person should not be presented.
“We can’t allow a crazed person or a jorobado to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image would not be fine.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with her colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?” he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old hoyuelos co-worker, Xu Yang, said, “Our work should present the image of the city.”
They’re also not opposed to their fixed-time work, they said, because they’re home to greater career ambitions than simply fleeing sellers in the streets where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen walking-and-bicycle vendors, trying to sell as many tofu pancakes or cups as possible before they are thrown away.
“Mr. Wang, you have to leave.”
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a seller escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bike-drawn car with fideos guarnitions.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is more or less the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare time.
“Very routine.”
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their men’s supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rallied after the false rumor was spread that some Chengguan officials had murdered a merchant.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the night incident; 14 government vehicles were wrapped or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
The calm is barely guaranteed.
Just two streets from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened up to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white insignia turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we struggle verbally.”
“Sometimes we struggle physically,” Mr. Li said naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors had excused Senator John Ensign of criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said it felt “assuredly happy” with the decision, which came after an entire year of investigation.
The Senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plans to raise charges against him on this subject.”
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have confabulated to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents first disclosed in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to silence Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton a job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant at Ensign, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, “it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major overturns for its public integrity department, including last year’s decision to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that top government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another phone call the next day, telling him the department didn’t want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, claiming that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hampton violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a leading Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who gained work through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign cabinet chief, John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and told him he was "blowing" the Ministry of the Interior on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after it had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to its voters and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
Afterining a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that it planned to apply for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, the senator said he expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign is eager to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them “chatting” in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the terrifying testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape process and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is ready to reach an official end, with the judge’s imposition of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have submitted to the court writings outlining the arguments of the appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “an atmosphere of circus,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details made public passions exercise an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr Hayes’s chief defense attorney.
First-instance Judge Jon C. Blue, of the State High Court, laconically rejected the claims in a ruling last week, saying that the media was “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been taken by the passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeal courts have recognized that coverage of celebrated cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a historic judgment of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard v. Maxwell case, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts that examined Mr. Hayes’s sentence half a century later could be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be needed to control the way communication from the court rooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile trials, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford School of Law professor who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from court rooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many topics outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them terrifying photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury who had criticized prosecutors, and incorrectly pressured for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate during a weekend.
The jury was not abducted.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a recusation to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by governor candidates and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continuously threw wood to the fire of excitement about the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters out of court,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and across the state.”
His attention to Twitter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said complaints about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly were a ludicrous view that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said appeal courts were often drawn to arguments about the adaptation required in courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes’ lawyers are pressuring for this claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, revoking Dr. Sheppard's sentence due to the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the 21st century Sheppard vs. Maxwell case.”
Can civism build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectivity and negativity, a little civism has unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a pronouncement of a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick turn to party combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders produced no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But by what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn party points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that persist among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a test period, polling each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed party war.
The reason why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations of the same by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and are too deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed in terms of how things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections awaken party passions, which then disappear.
That is good.”
On some issues, those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to extending unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make them believe they’re in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s White House meeting, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new nuclear disarmament treaty START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He argued, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontational one,” he said.
Also Wehner expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civism could lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the major event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
No matter how conscious Republican leaders are of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they should try to fulfill their promises of cutting state spending and repealing the new health law.
These party lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission’s recommendations, which include the tax code reform and the increase of some taxes and retirement age, and spending cuts.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest tasks in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly put the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18 member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officials in the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of party shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama over budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the recent election partyism, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead spot, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who considers that they are losing will likely change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are currently greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find points in common on the issues that still divide them.
Filed U.S. document portrays Moscow as corruption’s paradise
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", leaving a portion of the bribery and protection money to come directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle enormous blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical authority,” takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleansing since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several litigation lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he said: “It’s madness, a pattern, a hassle.”
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it’s unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it’s unheard of that it’s the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow City government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the statement said.
“The criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means ‘top’ or protection) that crosses through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow City government bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow.”
“Luzhkov is at the top.”
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are at the second level.”
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS raises money from larger companies, and that the police target small.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the money collection is complete, the protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy’s note reports of men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent poll on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked in place 154 (country are ranked at least to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late in the evening Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure, and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a concrete classroom weakly illuminated, with stained and scaly walls, High School Director Anlong Veng recalled the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves Ta Mok.”
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," Sreng Kor Ma, 42, said.
Known as "the Carnage" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmer surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Khmer to the sons of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first sentence for a former member of the Red Khmer, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among the Red Khmer veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating their efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to desert towards the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting the trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the earliest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Red Khmer officials retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying down their weapons, the Rasus soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have gained little after surrendering,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the utopian agraric ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised without any concept of doing business.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Red Khmer was fine,” he said.
“Ta Mok gave him food to all.”
“But now life is difficult because we have to self-supply.”
The current Red Khmer court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve as much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district leader in the Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent bitter afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden balls on a land road in the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows over the grasslands, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She said that if the court called her, she would not appear.
“Cambodia is in peace and stability,” he said.
“If there are more trials, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to the Khmer, is to re-unite the broken pieces,” he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces together so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Red Jemers, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s secondary school history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Red Jemers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Khmer, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
19-year-old Toque Valeak, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But her parents reacted with skepticism when she took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they’re not sure about how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
In any case, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hollow covered by an oxidized ceiling.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone seller on the edge of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handful of ripe bananas in the hope of having good luck.
Belarus to renounce qualified uranium reserves for weapons
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will give up its reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the remainder of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to a official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement was "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for arms) and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... we will not manufacture dirty bombs, and we will not sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with a low-enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence” that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of qualified arms uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential distention.
“While progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not repair the CIA flights
The Spanish government has not stopped CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo by Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in documents filed by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish Executive to be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft travelling through Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, including Spain, a meeting was held between the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council report "had taken the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no warnings to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “unattended,” Aguirre reports on a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest profile possible, although, by being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
For his part, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to ask for the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminatory elements or any sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the disclosed information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the US ambassador and the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are rabiosely jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expressed his concern for the PP’s action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government.”
The parricid confessed complained in the network of the "agony" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is “Muki” on the net.
With this nickname, which she has used since childhood, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the town of Coruñés from which she is originating.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies from their relatives.
The young woman, 30, started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tunez, an industrial.
It lasted one year.
When they left, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never allowed him to get a DNA test.
He soon met another boyfriend.
The chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But by the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance broke, they broke.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosquitous, because I have come to work."
“When I told him it seemed good, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
Then, she talks about a mobile message she just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child.”
She complains, “If I don’t like to leave the baby with my mother, I’ll pick it up when I come back,” she says.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I am going there, but I will only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job not to lose it."

The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view put in the general elections because, whether advanced or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes this formation gets in those elections usually doubles to what it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomous elections of 2006, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this trend continues to rise, which has been nourished by a swap of votes from the PSC and the fidelization of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose one member – now it has three – while ICV would stay with one member or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar isined, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular may also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four province capitals and in its relief at the head of the City of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populists agree on the possibility that the PSC loses the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or a possibility to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unfortunate that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it needs to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the role in the turn in the Tarragonese capital, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has situated only 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros,ins very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular has also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner of the Police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, among them "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the author of the last of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Interior Ministry has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with the “Operation Kampai” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level has been “weakened” and, “thus, its operational capacity.”
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "combatants" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence in the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the territory of the EU take place in the coming days strikes similar to the developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another operation was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were those who directed the cell settled in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network – part of which was struck in 2009 – robbed mainly tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called “World Islamic Front”.
That is, the documents should be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
According to the investigation, no data has been found to link the arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the recipients of the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the life of 106 people.
Police have seized a lot of documents.
The PP demands that Mas park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas her conditions to support her investure as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and prescinding from philo-soberan adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that it gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections of last Sunday, more than enough figure to be wanted, since the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain from the vote of investorship.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but for the time being, the conversations that Masins these days with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as far as the PP president is concerned, to support an investment "it will have to park all the sovereign and independentist discourses", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the converging leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to weakening the political apparatus of a very swollen autonomous administration and the elimination of the succession and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas’s investment will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their cellar killed more than 11 elderly
The responsibilities of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was there employed killed at least eleven elderly who had to his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center's lawyer, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility obliges us to assume the process situation of civilian responsible".
And it is that in addition to the social depreciation that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the caretaker in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the families of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the case that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - ancient patients of the geriatric - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by phone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday rotundely denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
The La Caritat lawyer added that "there is no single indication in the case that there has been an imprudent action by any other person other than the accused himself."
He confessed to 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he killed him by stabbing him a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is complicated to control that the staff of the center has access to the medicines.
Insulin punches and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to ease the suffering of the internals, used to kill them.
But the analyses that are being done in the laboratory will have to clarify whether Vila doesn’t lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them laxity as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the celator, not even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that it has to change its way of proceeding after committing, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say they are put at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s yesterday’s threat that warned “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral differentials have closed strongly and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What has occurred yesterday is characteristic of an illicit market that, as it collapses, recovers but is motivated by closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB called us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the government’s debt purchase plan be terminated for ineffective and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be removed on time, leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
Just like in their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and collapsed the markets, tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May it announced the bazuca on Monday and on Wednesday it said it had already bought a lot, provoking a new crash in the market.
Yesterday, the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, versus $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment following Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still has not enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension in the face of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for a aid plan would be an autoimmolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available the triple that in March, at very expensive rates and you close access to the markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar’s wife, “besides being, seeming.”
Take courage, we can.
Eulen's president will challenge the Vega Sicilia board requested by his children
The storm does not affect the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null of full right", the judicial board of El Enebro of the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to make their majority and be made with the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are finishing the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding to the company does not seem willing to give in his litigation to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
He was dismissed from his board by five of his seven sons who were appointed managers at the shareholders’ meeting on 18 January this year and whose complaint is listed in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, called by the magistrate of the Mercantil Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of the thunderstorms within the family Álvarez.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the applicants their five children to, by means of prosecution, in clear law fraud and abuse of law, try to validate and sane the radically null board of 18 January", according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for, once the board is held, to proceed to its contestation by considering that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, already tried without success that the magistrate called in June a board.
In El Enebro, patrimonial society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This issue is the substantive question that the judge must decide once the appeal has been heard, for which there is still no date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selected universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, nobody took into consideration the options of a newly arrived scooter and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship all bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari.
Without dismissing the ability as a driver of the finally champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far from high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft, or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’s industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in his Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and bring to effect “in a few hours, almost in real time,” the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the scooters in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles during each season.
Red Bull’s team today employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of modifications in the bolides.
Siemens's chief explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull's bolides with the exception of the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from the simulator’s virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this crazy technological improvement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as much as possible in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered “high secret.”
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including his two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull’s Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists are hidden whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety is zero.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the factory, said five years ago that R&D advances in wheeled cars contributed 50% of victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology makes up 85% of the success, while drivers make up 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing as "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to install 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes in Barcelona.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, put as an example the remodeled store located in the Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to place 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible opening, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HP personal systems director also assured that the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and highlighted that the exclusive network of shops aims to “improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, attention, after-sales and even packaging.”
The store in Barcelona includes a space with a worldwide pilot program that solves possible problems with HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracts for technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell plans to steal one million customers in three years
More optimistic than other managers, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially disclaims a new liquidity crisis and triggers the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it predicts a collapse of interest margins, which will be attempted to compensate in part with commissions and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new director plan that will have a three-year validity.
The goal, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to the public aid of the FROB, is to gain market share with the acquisition of one million new private customers -700,000 if they discount those who can leave the bank -, its large subject matter pending, since until now it had mimicked more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges the bank will expose when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare these days to set goals and make them public since the financial crisis has shattered all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima director plan, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it expand a further exercise.
Customers who let escape the savings boxes will be their primary target.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of liabilities – which penalizes margins – is reducing, the price of the risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their emissions to get liquidity are already moving to the price of credit to offset the fall of margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
“We haven’t closed the fence, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain “bigger sizes will be required.”
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
It says capital needs have "goed up a lot" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution will enter red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supplement the market in the capture of funds before new recapitalizations.
Having assured that Sabadell can survive the temporary shutdown of the markets, he rested importance to what some bankers already vaticine as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through rest, which lowers the crisis.
The CECA excludes a second wave of mergers in the box
The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a wave of savings funds mergers will occur and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the process of concentration of the Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Coins (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations would take place.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol to the group of Banca Cívica cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated very much too," he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executive of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta exposed that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the greatest speed possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is going to occur in the terms that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he stressed.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volumes to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no precedent in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta recognized that "there are a series of opinions quite unlucky about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who put it on trial a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings boxes, a system that has undertaken a "important" concentration process and that "goes at the highest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well standing from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and the 30% of State Lotteries.
Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Keep in mind that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which collides with the preservation of the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible outputs to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now looks like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressors, possible suspension of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government took out a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (planes for fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second in the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the decision to rescue Greece.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and public opinion were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that enables those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries who violate will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive foreign balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has dominated Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The sending is clear.
And we would hurt not to understand it.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence leaves way for more tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with large companies and the announcement yesterday of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn’t seem to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, the possibility of leaving a monetary zone too full of unserious countries cannot be ruled out.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The alleged expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether such behavior is anti-sports and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the match (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when drawing out all sorts of shortcomings to provoke the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In that way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of their group, both players will meet the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against the Auxerre, and can go clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team’s coach, José Mourinho, with two matches, and the players involved with different financial amounts.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate arising in the case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and which in past occasions has fined its players for analogous acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds an episode more to his dilated history of technician histrionic and provocative.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions are committed law fraud; since, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulation, but they seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question goes to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that the sporting spirit comprises is the physical integrity of the opposing players, aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that is referred to by the clean game is to prevent the team of the offender players from taking advantage of the opposing team unfairly, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as a trap or law fraud, because their violation of the rules was not done in hiding to try to avoid the sanction, but that precisely their action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and accepted the punishment.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders get in the deliberate misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to see that the rival is not placed in a disadvantageous situation or gained in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it’s not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won’t be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated at the first changes, and in addition with this performance the players meet a penalty game and pass to the second card cycle, in which the suspension for accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, from going through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor taking the most out of what the rules allow.
In the case that occupies us, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing out the punishment or escaping it.
Although the boundary between ingenuity and law fraud is diffuse, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the directive of provoking them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture group Christmas dinners in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the days 16 and 17.
They proliferate celebrations self-flagged by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turron and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the group dinners before Christmas also return, which continue to exercise as oxygen balls for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive of adjusted prices to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and sector associations interviewed.
To complicate the accounting, the calendar of this year (at the fall of New Year’s Eve on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of reservations of dinners for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the stage of weak cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
Not to mention the tradition, many workers keep it paying from their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some and others demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the patronal, to date, does not dare to vaticine how the celebrations of this month will be.
“People think about it long before booking.”
“He wants to leave but has the alerts on the price issue,” he said.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and reminds that customers tend to drop a ladder with the crisis, so that the range around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a poll in various central establishments, the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th is noted.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is an authentic boom of applications for that Friday, with the pretension of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the context, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most potent groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since early November.
“We have done the impossible to keep the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
In AN Grup, which leaves El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a rise in turnover from the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The group’s sources point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the parties.
To their six group menus they have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat greater.
On the part of the patronal Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, confides in starting to see the end of the tunnel andins that together the reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is, the illusion for the celebrations has not descended, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises U.S. concern
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filed by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program provokes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, instead of increasing, “decreases,” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country in the world.”
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that weapons are not assembled but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for disregard in Washington.
Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson said in a report before the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and motive to keep the guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with U.S. counterparts.
The most novelty of the documentation filed by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly diminishing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high pace of Pakistan’s production of nuclear weapons.
A statement from the embassy in May, which described the communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers are either left unanswered or discarded.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistani Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
The Chase of WikiLeaks
Obama has appointed a senior anti-terrorist officer to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, it’s November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the recent leakage of more than a quarter-million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens’ lawyer said that “the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.”
It was on the 20th that the international police body based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
The 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "in view of his interim arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization, consider the so-called network notice free way to proceed to an arrest -- which must be undertaken by the national police body -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder's willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, who is compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the world is looking for him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange remains in an unknown, but not silent stand.
On Monday, he gave an interview to Time magazine director via Skype from an undetermined location, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to emphasize Assange contrasts with opinions these days proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or help."
Far further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should “be murdered.”
“Obama should turn it into a target and use a drone or something.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of betrayal and anything other than execution would be a too kind punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with scams to Carod-related
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to sort out the ninth internal revolt in the ERC ranks, without north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation shutdown is insufficient for those related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that in no way can cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the Leader of Esquerra will try to win the new critics with cheats that allow him to blind up to the municipal elections.
Puigcercós announced that more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to speak out on its continuity in secret.
By paper, not by raised hand.
If the carodists want to vehiculate a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without precising percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The next to Carod demands from the president something more than putting his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But as they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap from here to May.
To do this, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the document of strategic reorientation that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for promising to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already gives for granted.
The leader of ERC recognized that the “polyphony” damages stability and that its goal is to make the organization able, once and for all, to wash the dirty clothes from doors inside.
In this line, the article that the conseller in functions Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the titular of Innovació gave for granted that the leader will be voted "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, to “recompose” the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militance, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second one may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly as a functioning mechanism.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already battled in this sense in the last two congresses.
Indeed, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the charge to the leadership to review the assembly at a specific congress on the reform of the statutes.
This appointment remains pending, as the internal tide of the last years did not advise to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors to the axle, it may be a good time to resume it and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the millennium count, the state of Mexico recorded a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the murder of three women and the discovery of a pair of sealed bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, there were 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gun shots and grace shot in the head in addition to the legs and hands tied with cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the hood of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán Colony, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On the morning of Thursday fourth, exilers found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, over the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway, in the section that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.

One day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was killed by eight bullets after leaving his home to start garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were ultimated with a bullet impact on the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the forehead was found the body of a man on a solitary path of the Colonia El Naranjo and beneath the body found a shell struck of a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the colony Playa Golondrina.
Emergency bodies carried out a thorough search for the other members of the body, but they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the finding of a corpse that was in the Peña Colorada area, which was tied with hands back and with the head wrapped.
The man had a wound caused by a gunshot in his neck.
Half of the month was the execution of two men, who were wrapped in cages and abandoned in the cage of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda fraction in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of warnings of death.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony he was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of his body with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two women were found without life in the Zoquiapan town in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning was found the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow cage with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executors left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with firearm shots in the neck, the body without life of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman’s skin were detected tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as collars with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec was found aboard a car with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their head and a message were found in the community of Ponte de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said: "This happens to those who don't align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied of feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was captured in the Colony Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and along with a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in streets of the Colony Juárez.
Next to him, the officers found a cardboard with a message.
China holds targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The country’s representative at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China remains committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals, but will continue to work jointly with the international community on that matter.
China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institutional building; and support for pilot programs.
In all these areas progress has been made, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reduction of gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he noted that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to energy savings, energy efficiency and emissions reduction targets.
In addition, various multiannual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are in progress or have already been concluded.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent focuses by savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government’s scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historic contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the past five years and plans to do another so much towards 2020, he said.
Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former leader of the panista is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what he is right to agree.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former panista leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is in his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case Espino’s expulsion is a decision adopted in the local area.
“This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission.”
"Mr. Espino has the right to go, if necessary, via a claim to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that he has never been on the negotiating table for an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional will come out strengthened from the next internal election on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was a approach for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he said.
The panista leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we do not fear the internal competition; we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said that without a doubt the council will know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
“I have that absolute tranquility and openness, any of the five would be proud to give him the office of the party president.”
He predicted that the rebound that registered the party in the past elections of July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming competitions, although "it is not time yet to think in 2012."
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this framework, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are put in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the priists to reflect on the sexenies of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they leave the closet,” he said.
He argued that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no murmur or much less censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps an open cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with the senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," she said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block voting on any legislation unless the extension of the Bush era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects can be set.
“I think there’s a lot of time...”
“We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year.”
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "debat closing vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But the supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at times when party organizations of the project play an intense battle to ensure the approval of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Therefore, the Dream Act supporters require several Republicans to join in the event that other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most voted Republicans are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but have declared that they will not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants made a gala of the narrative
"This of The Sex in the Language I understand but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature and this time used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to The Sex in the Language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "it puts us in tightness," the Argentine writer gently spotted the public, mostly young people, who met at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would define afterwards as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "crash" is, goes from physician to physician, of which she does not get answers although she does find clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist she comes convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scarring."
The protagonist suspected relieved and concluded “from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist”, but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must go very well.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delightful narrative he titled Elogio de la invención, where the finger in the wound is not named but at one point is discovered.
With brushes of magical realism, the account of a famous witch, who also played clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a maid, a narrative that turned to talk then America, the great novel to which he did not miss from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the captains conquerors.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the fake witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise he would never have come to tell the history of America with the imagination he lacked until the pudour."
However, he highlighted "the crazy and the embroidery are the ones who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that of the narrative belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogee.
It is called the “Cervantine Tradition.”
“By his inheritance we are what is counted.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montero applauded and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the FIL’s invitation with her round table El dedo en la llaga.
The Cuban-Portorican woman pointed out her own toward the great wound of social violence that travels through her country – and shares Latin America – product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs enclose a tacit commitment that, of course, is not premeditated,” he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a “chemical reaction” of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "this finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciences that he redundaces in dogmatism, forgetting “that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes”.
“To be masters of our thinking and to be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times putting the finger on the wound and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and bothering also the powers who prefer a world in white and black,” he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romero wins his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had highs in his career, but has been able to reach the decisive series in three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had highs in his career, but has known how to reach the decisive series in three occasions, although until now it has gone white and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian has ended up consoling himself with the sub-champion medal, has stayed a step behind the winners and curiosely with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The santista came to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open tournament, when he was holding the reins of the Morelia with which he fell by global 4-2 before Toluca; subsequently, in the 2003 Closure also came to the decisive duel and also lost it with a global of 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a reversal, as his team ended 2-2 against the chorisers after 210 minutes of game, but in the penalty round was put in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players his failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, he seeks to get rid of the malice and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an affair to which I owe and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," said the lieutenant when questioned him about the numbers he has against playing the finals.
Very valid has the previous final, from which, he assures, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee silks the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the race, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already prepared to go out running and I think that is a teaching, until the game is not over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shots, something that doesn’t bother him, because he trusts his players: “One never seeks to get to the penalty quarter, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad game the fate, sometimes by the nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it went to us, that left us something for this final that we hope not to arrive at that instance.”
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion technician and to test for the first time the glory that titles give.
Changing the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals will have to go to the Visa Applicants Service Center before their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for obtaining a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC) before their interview at the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for aspirants, among which are:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment for the appointment, another payment for processing the visa application and another more for the messaging service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their footprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay at the ASC for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA announces finding of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce on Thursday an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented at a press conference on Thursday at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as being in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present “a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” which has sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures like us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will reveal the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartidism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc arose in Congress, headed by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared independence, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartidism' to the Chamber.
Before starting the session of installation of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'trunked' against the reform to the Organic Law, as he excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts the 'bipartidism', because now two people, of the same number of parties, will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in their character of vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms in an institutional way it constitutes the political marginalization of part of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk with the PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be avasalled again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition was ended.
"Here it has come (the opposition coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, of any decision, not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be permitted, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopoly, now be "duopoly".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 lawmakers, and they are talking with other colleagues and colleagues so that they are more, the convergent abundated.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a 'botin' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
“Before it was just one game, now it’s being divided between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked respect the personality of the deputy, give him his place in the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, let out 5 that we probably go to make 9 deputies, save the five that see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the topic that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform."
Selling $200,000 more for the “supplier”
The City of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
A cheque more for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electric material company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the municipal transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to pay".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this provider, which was observed by the Superior Auditry of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you’re just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and this last, November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Journal, as the Law marks when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer assured that they have not re-used their services.
The previous, after that on July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the Municipality to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Emergency to tourist sites
Lament tourism businessmen accident of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Comerciants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is cared for and reversed the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and take the turn to the nearby.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a company one day and have no idea how much money is lost, or otherwise they’t do the works in this way in such a long time and without proper planning.”
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from passing again, how to do it because of preventive maintenance and not falling only into the corrective," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area it must beined, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.”
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlán.
“Today, in order for the tourist to come, it does not depend solely on promotion, it has to have a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions,” he said.
"The due attention has not been given and this type of fact shows something that is notorious to everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, expressed that it is urgent to rescue the tourist sites of Mazatlán, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be put on line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
“Fortunately Mazatlán offers many sites and historical and cultural sites that will have to be ordered first, cleaned up and put online to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.”
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the state executive claims the Mazatlán business sector, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces large problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature was installed, composed of seven political forces, 19 MPs from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one more from the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and engagement with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly premiered 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to protect their own interests and become carnival comparses of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Therefore, he spoke that they must certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to take the Governor in turn forward.
"We occupy them to come to do a dignified work and above all to be committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow foster job creation.”
As for tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give it the weight it has within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
“I have understood that it is the second secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruent as important economic activity and generating currencies and investment and that directly competes with the agro industry.”
In addition, it is necessary to label resources to detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and to update the Alcohol Law that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a Magician King
Puppies, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For her parents, the next King’s Day will be difficult to please her illusions, as her home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a whore.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and live on a daily basis because the father has no fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and papa ... in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her 3-year-old sister, Isabel, wants a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long sought to have a monster car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster,' but I said to him 'let's see son,' because he was very dear," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Miguel, 8, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of five-and-a-half size or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Seek a Magician King, donating a toy or cash at the reception of the Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested, facing various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in the courthouse of Sherbrooke in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," Ruel said.
About 70 officers from the Strie Security Investigation Module of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
It will be possible to combat illegal migration.
The conservative bill that, according to the government, should solve the problem of illegal migrants, will surely face a large opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
“I am primarily based on the letter.”
“I find myself here with a party that has created the granite you’re treading,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly meeting of the Caucus.
The liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow arrest for up to one year for anyone coming from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong blank.
"We are against and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will already see what the government does," Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“Neodemocrats agree that measures are taken against those in charge of clandestine patrons and that’s what we’re aiming for with another bill, the C-35,” Ms. Chow said.
“We don’t support the conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the party of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MEPs that they don’t tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and that they treat the country as if it were a felpudo.”
“They expect Canada to take firm measures,” said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote so that each MP who will oppose will explain to their voters afterwards.
The Council fails to unanimity.
Although the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit had been announced by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the matter.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Thus, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It must be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never debated despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party that deals with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as “a rabbit pulled out of the joke” and as “a last-minute messy solution.”
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ president Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public poll.
"The more Mr. Charest obstines in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
“The only way to have an investigative commission is with Jean Charest’s resignation,” explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead spot, he suggests Quebec to grant a special mandate to the interventor general to conduct an investigation into collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the interventor general,” he concludes.
He also considers that Quebec could grant the interventor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the heart of the Charest Government.
Quebec is also asking Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in this type of investigations.
Federal Public Security Minister Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to the moters groups, although the criminal code had not been adapted, 131 people were detained.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under Extreme Surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, an earthquake occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a precautionary measure, two houses were evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, various regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimeters are also expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain.
Given that these precipitations are added to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued warnings for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a precautionary measure, 10 homes have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the flooding of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Center, for its part, issued on Wednesday announcements reporting the strong grows of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly blamed by Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reversal before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements about social assistance and about Haitians, as well as for his rough language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inexact information on social assistance, an undue negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day.”
The Council has also indicated that debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints in connection with comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable data that does not lead to deception.
In relation to the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had manifested that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have come to the conclusion that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life’s problems.
"Most of the Committee considers that the episodes put into question of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a delicate issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any guilt has been rejected in this regard.
The latest dispute referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had aroused numerous reactions.
The host of CHOI stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know with certainty if the needy would really receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an undue negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already fulfilled my three-day suspension there up.”
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the emission of rude language.
In any case, the radio channel CHOI-FM has collaborated “even more than required”.
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of highest audience within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealese of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai boxing,” he explained.
“I’m currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China.”
They will invite athletes who have finished among the top four places in the last world championship in each category.
In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto.
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve been progressing in every competition.”
"At this step, I will be the first this time or next year!"
San shou or sanda is a discipline originating in China in which you are allowed to strike with your fists and feet, as well as throw your opponents to the ground.
Fighting originally takes place on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of fighting is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to maintain a competition in his career, he will surely go to the big "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” explains the sympathetic boy.
"It's like the equivalent to Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium)".
“It was an incredible experience.”
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“He who has won me is a real professional,” he said.
There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).
"The winners of the semi-finals face in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
$450 million in non-procurement
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this more than 100 contracts lava is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior bidding the most important contract, the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the recourse to consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition.”
“That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly,” Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard said in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that a collusion with this contract had occurred.
“I started to get tired,” he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted “unhonestly” and “with a lack of rigor.”
He said the “minimum” would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a bidding for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition coming into play; it has been a negotiation.
Furthermore, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir last week, the formula of the consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at the Quebec Commercial Register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
This way, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, that is, Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has highlighted that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular dynamic of labor and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
“If you respond to an auction and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the industry and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory deal and with a good price."
"H, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, it amounts to $449,783,344, including the $295,131,1564 contract with Énergie gérance.
Sylvain Simard has said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let down that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before precising that it is rather about its leaders.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption: The “green” label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
Quebec consumers hardly trust the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse.The consumer is submerged in a media universe where messages pulse that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even brakes his commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of the same, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that carry the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsible," the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the dubious character of the information cause 46% of consumers to reject this option.
This is the second barrier identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebec residents say they are also suspicious of the alleged yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
Moreover, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have preferred shopping in their neighborhood stores and preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
More green and responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points above a peak of a hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be outdoors (of their car): in 2010, only 28% of Quebecians indicated that they had used public transportation or shared car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, supports bicycle use and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex with the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who expected a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return to him their true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they were asking.
The government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be, in fact, lower than the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been reviewed down.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to the Minister St-Pierre.
He submitted a last report about a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation should be completely rejected.
Remember that the Association of Proprietors of Cinemas and Cinematic Complex Quebec opposed a direct state investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are demanding considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried for ten years the load of the author's cinema in his premises of the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had fidelized its clients.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are launching a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way to the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to project films on eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th, projecting Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the lower proposals they have received.
The Canadian veil is lifted.
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with regard to the Americans, but reflect at the same time the sentiment of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they’re going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get their 2009 budget approved!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer more juicy details than substantial content.
A cable from September 22, 2008, that is, during a full federal election campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the U.S. ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
“Per political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent in Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the free trade campaign of 1988),” he writes.
Consequently, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "stunning silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, she thinks, the ability of a candidate, of a party, and even more, of a party’s leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This sense of importance can also be observed in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business officer in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will contribute to ensuring the government’s survival during the February confidence vote on the federal budget, through which Canada will record deficit for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion,” writes Mr. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington of the increasingly negative image transmitted by the dramatic series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or even the kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
During her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended “on each case.”
At the end of the meeting, they wrote “he delivered a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
“The Secretary agreed to review the file.”
Finally, we can mention that the animosity in connection with the WikiLeaks site has been heated.
Tom Flanagan, a former counsellor close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the man responsible for this mass escape should be "assassinated".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is in charge.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a amount that corresponds to virtually one-third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of large concrete projects that the UN expects to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.800 million tons (Gt) of GEI emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GEE emissions from 53 to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this quantity should still be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from uncontrolled.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorescent compact bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced even more than twice.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostates and emit very little heat.
They do not contain mercury.
Several experts have expressed concerns about compact fluorescent bulbs, as they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emission on the planet are not fluorocompact bulbs, but coal-fired thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, these power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages this international program would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the immediate publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential elections, as the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent election commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed the deadline of Wednesday to midnight to pass without the results being published, three days after Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the CIS president had commented on television that the commission “still worked” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, requests have multiplied around the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo’s side has the constitutional council’s cancellation of the “fraudulent” votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed September 2002 coup.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivory Coast president's campaign, said the FN's voter-intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
Now, Gbagbo’s opponents consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from spreading the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday should have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday the political class of Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on mainland territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, a 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and a 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and look for employment or not.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a new rise in unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in a year), that is, 482.000 people over the age of 50, a figure that rises to 6.6% with DOMs.
The unemployment rate among people aged between 25 and 49 years was only stable, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Investigated and Arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a director of waste treatment companies and brother of the president of the PS General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, malversation of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reproachable acts, another thing is to prove them," her lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close friends, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done is take care of the landfill he must manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the literate Simon.
In the framework of this case, Daniel Pinna, former general director of the services of the Aubagne urban agglomeration, has also been investigated since Wednesday for malversation of funds and complicity, but he has been released conditionally and has been forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
“My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached to him.”
“The instructor has taken into account the explanations and has released him,” said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with “influence trafficking and passive corruption.”
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "sustraction and malversation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and "complicity in the malversation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering the abuse of social goods.”
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
The researchers suspect that their societies have a service to whiten the capital of the big banditism.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research notes that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has had the public in France on the lookout, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of American diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée has explained its strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by U.S. justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar Al-Assad, had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on August 12, 2009 in Paris was titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases."
The Elysée adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
The French method is used.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens detained by force in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate release”.
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discrete channels are exhausted, “silence will not solve anything”, the Iranians are “experts in dilatory manoeuvres”.
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a usual Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a lot of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he notes that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that “will increase.”
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is sought by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The US embassy, as well as numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to the Iranian clandestine networks of procurement of material for the nuclear program, the imprisonment of Majid Khakavand constitutes bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Will Iran be liberated in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that it was not so.
The Elysée, he says, not only “has been enormously surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the decision" of the court, he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the “strict” surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elysée counselor makes a phone number, hangs and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not escape efforts, uses communications and organized “leaks” in the media to make believing that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a “important” and “influential” role of “mediator.”
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and prove that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions “the media ‘blitz’ of French officials.”
What is this “gratitude” toward Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praiseful statements, French officials admit in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The following document deals with the reasons that have led the Elysée to set foot on this fiction.
The large communication effort “has the purpose of validating Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which “in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been labeled premature and unmerited.”
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris tries “to show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The aim is also to “seed the seed of the discord between Syria and Iran.”
The US embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
“But anyway, we thanked him.”
“At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is in the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean government will adopt a law called “Cinderella” that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16, according to representatives from the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many kids play all night and then it’s hard for them to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
"We think this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law.
The government is also asking companies to limit the daily time of access to these games when the parents of young people so request, he added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request free computer programs that allow to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report on various events linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates organising countries
Amidst the thunderstorm provoked by corruption suspicions, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appointed the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to prevail over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation expects to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a debut on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that formed part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions behind the scenes, therefore, may last until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two CE members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the fireplace on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential CE members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the British officials, who have thrown into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the successful coup done by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 JJOO.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain England’s brightness before the CE?
It is unclear, since the Spanish-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World Cup 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could throw their ambitions down.
The possible retaliations against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the only thing they can do is give points to Russia, which has become an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadions, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the British press against the members of the EC.
“They are shedding out their dirty clothes, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
As the world’s first economic power and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fiercely desired by FIFA, would cause Asia to be left without chances by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weak TV fees paid (depending on the hourly difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Part 2: The Test
De Gaulle had doubts.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he had doubts.
Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest doubt.
Nicolas Sarkozy is still less.
One mandate in the Elysée leads to another.
The current president will be re-elected in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear to be doubtful.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, even if they didn’t believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed he didn’t rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take his decision "at some point in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with UMP deputies, on Tuesday night in the Elysée, the possibility of “two terms” has provoked a certain uproar.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It just conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
It’s not the first time he talks about the presidential elections, with a jokeful tone, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: “Don’t think I’m not asking myself what will come after.”
Their statements of yesterday do not bring them closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the talk that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Rather the opposite; the fact that their candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people from the PS to claim that the battle is organised earlier than planned.
On the other hand, bad surveys.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject in the UMP," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he thinks he can lose, he won’t be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
The ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to clarify the ways to get out of the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end by the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institution will not be able to afford to be so perentory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
During a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the active role played by the ECB in favor of the solution to the European debt crisis.
He did not want to say whether he considered the central bank should do more, for example, by increasing its government bond purchase program.
“I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues.”
On the eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, the ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent in terms of his intentions, indicating only that the secondary market letter purchase program "continued" and that "we will already see what we decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to close to EUR 1.350 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday it would have bought Irish and Portuguese bonds again.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased bonds worth €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that they will follow the purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant change in direction.
Although more than three-month lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still carries out unlimited liquidity allocations on favorable terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months.
“I don’t think I’m going to change your program substantially.”
“If not, it would risk provoking new short-term tensions,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at the Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that a progressive outcome announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur,” said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
by Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds so that the market remains stable,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It must compensate at any cost for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that it prevents a marked rise in yields paid by the most fragile states,” said a leading bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are put by the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government capes the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation slightly improved yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the exit of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as “indecipherable” and that a “unpredictable” weekend was expected, statements later dismissed by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQ) had risen to 263 points, provoking a certain upswing in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "turbulence in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to deal with its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (from 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for a sum of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted,” said Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have said for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian manager at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem is political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Representatives, after which elections could be anticipated in late March.
In such a case, a period would open up unfavourable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms for fighting crisis
Christine Lagarde said: “I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone.”
Although it was relative, yesterday’s relaxation in European state bond rates has pushed governments and the ECB.
However, we can not talk about a standardization principle yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent white in speculation.
"Like in May, there is really a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on the banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
“The political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying the debates to reinforce the mechanisms already existing to get out of the crisis.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on track.
And this taking into account also the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures supporting the euro area countries in the market colimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has begun a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it prepares the ground.
The first issuance of EFG bonds is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are added to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before applying their own budget corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider indispensable to increase trust in a lasting way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, question the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back out of the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe an additional €100 billion would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, currently endowed with €60 billion.
A advice that could undoubtedly examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already in orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snow falls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snow slightly on Isla de Francia.
A layer of between 2 and 5 cm, puntually between 7 and 10 cm, is expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Island of France and Lemosin.
The snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been banned for heavy vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, traffic in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it not be driven except in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transportation was banned in Picardia.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture “instates all drivers to drive with the utmost prudence on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.”
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris’s Roissy airport on Thursday and 10% at Orly due to planned snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transportation on the island of France has reached its peak, billions have rained.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the $23 billion for the Grand Paris subway to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4 billion euros.
Theoretically, this amount will allow the SGP to subsequently obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
We finally have the first accounts.
The rectificative finance law of 2010, examined in the National Assembly’s finance committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first portion of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is “in favor of the public institution Société du Grand Paris”.
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The output of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists “to modernize it, increase its product and destin this increase to the Société du Grand Paris”.
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows .
There are no figures in the text.
But it’s far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that the fiscal resources will be added to the €4 billion of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the exhibition of reasons.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explain."
"It will be registered in the budget and will be used according to the needs."
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4 billion dollars are not in the credit, may provoke a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avengers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it uncovers an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears to be a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let’s go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars, or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unprecedented research (or do not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who are dedicated to occultism do not just trust what they already know, which confirms what they had already learned.
This is the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The same applies to secret records.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, the editor of the Libération) is lazy (or has little anxiety), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
So why have the revelations of these records caused such turmoil?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, namely, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of States can call by phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become centers of espionage.
Anyone who sees research films knows this perfectly, but we only appear that we do not know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly breaches the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the “verdugos”.
But let’s get into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, at Orwell’s time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, motorway taken, the citizen was thus a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as is now the case, that even the crypts of power secrets cannot escape a hacker’s control, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and turns circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can one withstand a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is evident that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like publishing it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it’s also obvious that, with current technologies, you can’t expect to keep confidential phone conversations.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of his counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for now, my forecast is science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as much as possible, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked cages: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a cable telegraph (telephonic).
The video (analogous) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, advancing and falling back, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to advance or fall back from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the normal that politics and communication techniques take us back to the horse cars.
One last comment.
In ancient times, the press was trying to understand what was secretly handled in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s hats on its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the promises of rapidly unlocked funding (so-called early starts) made by developed countries have been met.
And the French chopsticks were uncovered.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.260 million (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast-start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation resulted appreciable and was appreciated for what really is worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same thing and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what “new and additional” means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that most suits them.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: international funding isined and 150 million in three years is added in the concept of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, it does not refer to the expenditure of previous years or the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funds.
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowed equals one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to emission reduction that are based on more effective technologies), it is false to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a donated euro... As a lot, you should only compute for your commitments the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (i.e., the equivalent to an interest rate).
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it with your own eyes.
It is the only country in the EU that uses this loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with a 100% donation.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
This is a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions in time and, on the other hand, in relation to real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation by the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has taken care of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The early financing chapter is a detail, relatively short-term, in relation to the whole of climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope it is not so.
Anyway, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect its commitments and in the same way as the rest of the European Union countries.
But, in particular, France could advance the debates on gambling in relation to long-term financing (another key chapter that is currently being discussed): we will not get rid of the question of the “additional character” or the method for computing loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on other issues.
Therefore, we have the hope of the new Minister of Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast starts and its vision of the “additional character” and the use of loans would contribute to improving the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results “do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated,” acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a ten-year-old child usually consumes in four meals and one tentempié a day.
These model meals, which comply with official recommendations (five portions of fresh fruits and vegetables, three portions of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as sweets, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
“Al, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumers’ exposure to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about a dozen residues that can damage the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a tentempié for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya’s green Jews, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
Furthermore, Russian filet, tunic, and even the bar of bread or cheese were wrapped with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chlorine.
At dinner, the salmon roll was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical waste detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave wasn’t completely clean.
The final risk generated by these “pollutant cocktails” for consumers is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
