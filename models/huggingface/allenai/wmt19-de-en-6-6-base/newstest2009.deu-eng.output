The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into a minus against business closure.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the very beginning of Tuesday ’ s business, the Prague Stock Exchange linked to Monday ’ s slump when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the slump was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market ’ s reaction to the outcome of the vote by the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is evident.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was able to compensate for some of the losses later, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the Chinese stock movement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell by 3.6 percent according to the local index.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, the chief monetary authority in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its own monetary policy, regardless of the central bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush ’ s call to support the plan.
Bush ’ s view is that the plan would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, America ’ s shares had a bloodbath, and the main equity indices recorded the largest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, with a similar slump last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any evidence that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives.
Congress Confessions: US government allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
This is to be voted on early next week.
American legislators achieved a breakthrough in talks on the adoption of a bailout in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressmen must negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank told the Reuters agency.
According to different data, the Senate could probably vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication that the plan is being adopted should be the first major psychological factor in stimulating financial markets.
After that, however, there was a 'disillusionment' due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package should look like to stabilise the market, "said Nancy Pelosi, a democrat with the Bloomberg agency.
They say that a final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of legislators met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from the financial companies, which plunge financial firms into serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The recovery plan needs to be continued, but I think we are at the end ", says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of Nevada ’ s Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is because it is intended to reassure investors of business in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a Congress decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not yet quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations could fail at the last minute due to a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it feels that the program does not fulfil its function, with another $100 billion, and later with the final $350 billion.
Bush favours progress in negotiations
The President has a veto right in this decision, but Congress can overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We have worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday ’ s progress and “appreciated the two-way effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy. ”
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and establish a committee to which the supervision of the fund is to be entrusted.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance ’ s chief economist David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because one does not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses, "said Marek to the iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not decisive, Marek believes.
"It is much more important that congressmen agree to support the plan and adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on adoption is the most important thing at this moment, "Marek stressed.
Messers Duel: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
Whereas almost every mobile phone can play MP3's files, no MP3's player can call.
So, of course, it looks like it is better to buy just one phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why you should get an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Sure, it ’ s hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc ’ s latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
But if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream at least of one.
So this is also with the music on journeys, that is with compressed music, simplified expressed - music in MP3's format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but just as a Pink Floyd supporter will hardly cope with headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The service life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do is not even hint.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephony and simulation, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you include the smart phones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle, because no fridge can grill and no television can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more frequently you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are much more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect cheap phones to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you then call from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for security - this also applies to more expensive devices.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have USB termination, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be ready without any reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library by themselves, arranged by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When selecting a specific device, you should particularly inquire about the service life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
For you, music is above all a backdrop and listen to it every day only briefly in the tram, for example, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is sufficient.
What really almost every mobile phone can.
You also do not have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most popular, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can in itself be a striking argument for why you should get a music handy.
Unfortunately the offer of the providers is bad and limited mostly only to fast radio bits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of the mobile phones carry with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music handys will be the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is their ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the formerly normal cassette recorder or for example the record player is obvious.
There is no danger of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmission.
After which device you should now grab
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But respect.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Are you among the more sophisticated listeners, take rather specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use is so close to that of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery lifespan (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) afford you MP3 and players of the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Perhaps
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer practically all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Perhaps this one will not wait long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, there is probably a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a battle announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile providers like to denounce the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
The Chair of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ) often agrees with Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (by the way, it would probably find hardly any frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which then also the classical mobile providers had to react.
Even before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
But it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don ’ t need to look for examples for long.
In February we reported about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers, making it the fifth largest supplier in the country.
The Penta financial group, which owns U: fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can concentrate on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
You do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually distinguish themselves as low-cost providers - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobile king in Poland shows, it can also be a good move to put on a non-clichéd target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
Difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could take root in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the services offered. "
In the Czech Republic, the mobile providers say
But it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
It will rather lead to a market entry of mobilking in other countries of our region, "says Jana Studničková, press officer of the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile phone provider has long been demonstrated by the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering not only fixed and mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already achieved progress in negotiations with some of them, "said Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson for the group.
Perhaps better times are coming now.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not assume that there is room for a fully-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has addressed us ", says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other providers point to the specifics of the Czech market.
The press spokesperson of T Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 declaration: "So far we have not found a viable and mutually advantageous project on which one could build further."
And she adds: "By the end of the year, hardly any virtual provider will appear in the net of TMobile.
At this moment we would have to have a concrete offer already, in order to be able to think so in the short term. "
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open for negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we regard as the best from the customer ’ s point of view.
Vodafone ’ s main strategy in this area is to search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. ”
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U: fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ at the moment, when U: fon came onto the market, came from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTU websites.
But just U: fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive field of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on his services. "
Given this approach by mobile operators, however, the absolute disinterest of Czech regulators is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately, unlike Britain and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in Czech.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem to his quite typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile operator would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential prospective customers was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical providers ", said Kristián Chalupa of the department of external relations of the ÚOHS in his answer to our request.
Representatives of providers would not surprise such a formulation.
This is more than questionable from an authority that represents consumer interests, among other things, to ensure that no one is abusing its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
But probably the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely identical fuel price at the filling stations is surely only coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of action against competition in this matter, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably missing from the telecoms regulator, "said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
None of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position on such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the cellular operator has - logically - a monopoly for its net.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if one does not go along with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile providers are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a quite common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS dissociates itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act, it has not been possible to enforce the extension of the competences of ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's already possible when nobody looks
Nevertheless, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider remains, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partly public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected ones.
The joke of the thing is that the company acts as a classical company customer vis-à-vis the operator, who orders a large amount of SIM tickets.
As an important customer he receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which can lead to an end to the cooperation with the corresponding company," answered Martina Kemrová on our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not get around with those responsible for mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, they may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, they do not derive any negligible profits from the activities of these companies, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
Furthermore, they must accept that the SIM debit card does not run on their name in their phone, so they cannot have it fully as normal customers of mobile providers. "
But this alone should at least happen strangely to the ČTÚ.
There is also another question for ÚOHS.
Do mobile providers close their eyes to such a procedure, why are they blocking a virtual provider?
It should be added that ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to contend with the declaration of providers that they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been pointed out several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers resulted in a significant price decline in the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classical providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened precisely at these moments, which did not attempt to safeguard the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Be it through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator emerged, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are throwing themselves into the whole case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But let us not throw the gun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon emerges, the Czech mobile market may soon be set in motion again.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, ÚOHS will not remain idle when it comes to refusing (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best out
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech State Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a ceremony the new recordings of the national anthem Wo ist mein Heimatland.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
He had already told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo versions, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that the text can be understood well, so that a harmony can be achieved", says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was performed for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Ständetheater in the originally Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained it even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
On Wednesday, Prague ’ s transport services will also be transported on a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in the history of Prague ’ s transport companies as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will enter an underground train, tram or bus.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or yearly coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time put it on their chip card, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the website of transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the U Bahn stations, where they had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played onto the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, a desk with trained staff is also available to travellers who advise interested parties on the purchase of the Internet and also put the coupon on the map", says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the Opencard on self-service machines, which are installed in some U-Bahn Vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket valuers, passengers may have noticed them already in the underground stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrný adds.
Controls the coupon instead of the driver's machine
Operating the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to insert the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"On trains belonging to the Prague integrated traffic, the train attendants have read devices with which they can check the validity period of the coupons by time and zone", explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid the ticket control. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the ticket office with the driver.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the Opencard must be placed in a marked place at the side of the checkout.
The driver controls the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons, nothing is easier than to ask the driver for this information," said Drápal.
A passenger who does not use suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon will end can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans had asked in 1945 for the integration of the Bohemian Forest into the United States.
This emerges from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a desire some groups of Sudeten Germans should have turned to the US president in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words, "People to whom the fate of the Sudeten lies at heart".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans to suspect - in knowledge of the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protection over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are referring to a state that is foreign to us, which is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies," reads the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubts the attitude of the Bohemian Forest German aristocracy, it is sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau about whether the inhabitants would become part of the USA or want to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today ’ s knowledge of post-war history, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, however, it provides a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that they would negotiate their deportation from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a German Budweiser at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and he was taken to a POW camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would suit them," said Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Do not think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign addresses motorists
Most adventurous action for safety on the roads in Czech history.
This is also how the emotionally charged media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday, could be characterised.
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The 150 million crowns campaign will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take drivers away from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to harness before driving.
The campaign mainly wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Above all stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign testifies to this:
Do not think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in uppercase letters on a label.
And in a bloodshed there is the word "pay".
This means that you can pay a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can see quite normal pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick for motorists
"The motto for the drivers is carrot and stick.
Carrots means that they save time, for example when driving red.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk ", said the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Kořán hospital.
This is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, even less effective are panels that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow into the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out in favour of the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highlands, if peace with Palestine and Syria can be concluded in exchange for this.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to assign a similar percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce part of Jerusalem," noted Olmert in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work ", he continued.
Withdrawal from the Golan peaks
Olmert argued for Israel ’ s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians know all too well what they need to do without in order to get back Golan's heights.
They will have to relinquish their current relationship with Iran; they will have to relinquish their relationship with the (Shia) Hezbollah Movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shia) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al ‑ Khaida and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "the Prime Minister concretized.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus the circulation is not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk around while driving on the bus.
"If we strictly and formally wanted to comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport", said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a twenty-two year old stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
At this moment, the young woman was sitting next to the driver, in the least secure place in the car, although she had two more places at her disposal.
But a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment when the steward carries coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays, whether the bus is equipped with standing places after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided in the bus, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency have no standing places; the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not agree first to the movement of travellers.
Later, this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat, "he said.
The law knows no steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport knows only the term vehicle attendants; however, it does not define its rights and obligations, "the spokesman of the Hanzelka Ministry adds clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus has standing room in the product approval.
That is all, "he emphasises.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permissible speed and seats, which are equipped with safety belts.
As in the aircraft, the expert says
Jaroslav Hořín, a specialist in road safety, sees stewards moving on board a bus as no fundamental problem.
"In the case of a fluid mode of driving, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can kick his head. "
"If a bus brakes sharply, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations ", he says and also means that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider her profession to be risk-bearing even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers upon boarding.
This would also reduce costs, "he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of stewards in his buses. His company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We have no stewardesses, we resist from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident, "he had said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had an accident that had worked for two years for the company.
The Slovenian truck was probably without blinking from the stand and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two places for the stewards had been sold.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company intends to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but will also expect financial compensation from the culprit.
A legislative amendment?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the stewards movement on board a bus could bring a legal regulation, on which a thirty person expert team of the transport ministry already over one year works.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda either, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving ", said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that could significantly jeopardise the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, where the control of the safety of buses lies in the competence of the police and occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of great words in the WestLB ’ s letter to the House ’ s staff.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka -Bank "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen -Finanzgruppe" could arise, it says in the letter became known on Monday.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the national banking sector.
So it reads, if a board wants to demonstrate in difficult time ability to act.
Because WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the state government of North Westphalia recently made clear, urges the time to find a solution to the future.
However, WestLB has for some time been talking about a connection between Deka and Bank, which savings bank customers know about because of their investment funds.
He did not see any sense in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB, when he presented the half-year figures at the end of August.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each half supported by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbänden, has instructed the Board of Directors to hold talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about capital market business or parts of it.
Nevertheless, the talks have only just begun, it is said, at the financial centre.
It is not the first time that we have heard about Deka and its 3000 employees, one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deka's bank could merge with Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
But nothing became of this three-alliance.
Hardly had the plans become public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba ’ s participation in it.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
Landesbank Rhineland Palatinate instead went to Landesbank Baden Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a link between Deka and Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to mature that the coming together of the various houses of the public legal sector is in need.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, the first link between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden Württemberg could be closer.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, you will gradually assume the partners for it.
In the south, it would only be more junior partners, although it has so far gone far better through the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Savings Banks and Giro Association of Hessen and Thuringia, which holds a stake of 85 percent in the Helaba, put a stop to a meeting with West LB.
If necessary the Nord LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the crucial question with which business model the future capability of the Landesbanken should be ensured had not yet been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end there could also be a dismantling of West LB, which is, of course, not desired there.
In the letter of the local board, it is also mentioned that a "total solution" for the house is in any case sought.
How this can be reconciled with the merging of individual units with the Deka Bank is still to be seen.
The second meadow weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the "Five litre beer barrel" of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bear tiger and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest's traveller, what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a flap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus park next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses start this evening at 11.45 p.m., "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for the Italians, in one bus only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans sing beside their flag already, they celebrated already at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that this is nothing for Italians.
Marco, wearing a long coat with fur lining and glasses with wide silver straps, belong to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Oktoberfest, back at 22.30.
Staying would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome drink with emperor beer, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - inclusive.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly it becomes quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they will still need their strength.
It will be held in Bressanone and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian registration plates will take a break on Highway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives at half past seven in the morning in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to it the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it is called!" Marco calls into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, distribute in space!"
The measure, roars Marco, cost 8,25 Euro.
And tip do not forget.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone! "
Thirdly, "This evening, point half past eleven will come back here again!" Understood?
And already it goes to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to the signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
One wants to be prepared for the retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as "Italian weekend".
There are no precise figures; there are 50 000 people who are heading over the Alps and who come into the beer tents; ten per cent of all visitors are expected to come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a nation-statistics, in which the Italians take first place in front of British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical services.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, said the Minister of the Interior, Peer, only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also that the German banking sector is not spared the crisis-ridden developments.
This has now happened on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in Dax, receives a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, lending amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to interest the part it uses.
The money comes from both private and public banking.
Background are losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financier had refinanced himself extremely quickly - which is now no longer possible because of the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank ’ s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly decreased from 1.6% to 1.45%.
Ongoing income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared with the same period of the previous year, income from write-downs on receivables and certain securities, and from the dissolution of provisions in the lending business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursement of downstream billing costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax code and from business management for Group companies, the earnings minus of around 16 percent had still been moderate.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former public financier had speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been dispersed in Aareal Bank.
Because they earned too little in classical public finance, the Depfa had then increasingly engaged in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to make write-downs that will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss statement, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been cut by two thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely dried up, as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing for part of Depfa ’ s credit portfolio – some EUR 50 billion per year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financing needs of the group will be covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company will be "shielded from the influence of the currently largely ineffective international money markets".
It can be heard from other sources that refinancing is secured by the end of 2009 thanks to the funds.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This stands for the Bank ’ s shareholders and creditors to hope for.
But, given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that the funding should not be used in full.
But even the opposite is not to be exploited.
After hearing that the bank was still facing insolvency on late Sunday evening, the at least provisional rescue cannot reassure the minds.
The share price falls by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
In contrast, the bond rates are quite good.
While the primary debt is barely moving, the prices of the subordinate bond yield more clearly.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are particularly affected and understandably the maturities exceeding 2009.
Once a speculative investment alternative, hypo is a real estate bond, its value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharp worsening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments, and less troubled commercial banks are still ready to support the system, pensions can be expected to be repaid in due time.
Or else, what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But, in view of the reports about partial nationalization, the likelihood of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This should prepare long-term believers in particular some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors can nevertheless use a line to make a loss lecture for future remuneration tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana Highschool, the girls begin to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange Log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Already before the school trip I had Bammel.
I live at the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I did not run away.
The beginning of the course does not seem as strictly fixed at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive from eight o'clock, until at twenty before nine a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lessons began, I was in my turn to introduce myself.
I am not at all the guy who likes to talk to people, nor in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, along with blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have my birthday in a week.
At the moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all clamped, layered and waved and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute, sweet '.
Then I quickly got into my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she found it an honor that the student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stormed.
All talked in confusion and giggled and asked holes in my belly - it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of them took off their bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is something different than the desolate German snack bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Usually I have no pale shimmer, what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is certain that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums perhaps, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-prepared Bento to to a boy, which she then creates especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely with the Pausensnack.
I read comics of this in my manga.
I am curious if I can observe this here.
'Why Japan? 'my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I have been reading mangas for years.
And to help me understand the comics and culture better, I also started to learn a bit of Japanese at some point.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a passion for tradition, customs and customs.
And one attaches great importance to this.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I didn ’ t feel lost here, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I ’ ve ever seen. ”
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in danger, that means that she also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how could one check if they feel the same when they behave like us?
The Internet publication "Edge" has published contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of sensation or generally of consciousness, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it turns dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists discover a comparable subjective experience.
I do not believe that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated almost always with the human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man even differs from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity might lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, one could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, probably very different from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could study the processes of consciousness of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts rather to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: Both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasises the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the creation of visualization.
What results in the sensations?
I refer them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the immune system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and, in particular, people.
Combined with the linguistic nature, fine gradations of sensation arise, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states, in order to attribute them to ourselves as well as others.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, says that sensations from more primitive activities in the body emotional regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in intergenerational sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict this, but consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears like fear in rats and people is likely to feel the same in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees in danger if she also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioural similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
While the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain strains, scavenger do not even have a brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for sensations?
And even if one could prove this for the human being: How did one prove it with rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I didn't know how to prove that.
And because their sensations probably differ fundamentally from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is waving at the neural level, provided that the same is measured for rats and people.
As I do not research language and consciousness in rats, so do not sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than running constantly against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the European Championships together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries. "
The two hosts are lagging behind on schedule for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Perhaps even the number of European Championship stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can no longer waste time.
We now have to work at maximum speed, "said the Ukrainian Federation's President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa's president Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several first-graders were sentenced for manipulation alone last season to a forced descent, after all even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about private things in an interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood's star Meg Ryan outet her expose Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
The foam - and strikes back.
Late Rosenkrieg at the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant quarrel with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud was experienced only after the divorce.
Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" was the reason for the soul striptease - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid ’ s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “It ’ s outrageous, ” said the 54-year-old of the“ New York Daily News, ” that “Meg once again chews and seals the history of our relationship. ”
It is also "regrettable" that the 16 year old son Jack, together, is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that constitute a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his insertions close with the sideline: "My life goes on anyway.
I feel happy that I have a wonderful family that works best. "
Prices for flight tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights became even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant decline in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, the overnight stays in many places have already decreased.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities investigated rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a reason for this American Express sees the weak dollar course, which led to a "decreasing travel experience of American tourists".
Financial centers such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in the first quarter also showed an upward trend in flight prices:
Due to kerosene prices, travellers in the economy had to pay an average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for Economy flight tickets declined by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First Class price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices collapsed even more than in other European countries:
Prices rose by 11.9 percent from January to March, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, prices have even halved on domestic German flights.
The reason for the collapse of prices is, on the one hand, the decline in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market bröckele.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure through the open-minded skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1: 0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburger SV is the leader.
With Borussia Luhukay still does not manage to find a working elf.
From Kristoffer Klein enlarge break-landing for Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, and she was persuasive about his lips.
He simply knew that he was right.
"We need the second gate," hissed Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburger Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades; he enjoys a higher reputation than many of his actors.
And so his request was heard in a responsible position.
Assistant trainer Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, head coach of Hamburg.
His command will have been similar: Her with Tor zwei!
Implementation did not stop.
"Not everything was nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have wished it to be "more relaxed".
The hamburgers owe the 1: 0 (1: 0) to Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon the spectators already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as class primus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate record is more for the league ’ s unpredictability than for its HSV ’ s dominance.
The team with their late entries - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Torschützen Petric as well as the FC Bavaria cast Jansen - finds themselves slowly, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," said Jol.
After the vote
On Wall Street, fear is changing.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points within one day in its history.
Later the Dow caught something again.
Around 20: 30 o'clock the world's most important stock exchange barometer listed with a good five per cent in the minus at 10,579 points.
At more than seven percent, the Nasdaq technology exchange was down 1548 points.
At that time, the biggest loser was in the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could be won.
Bank Goldman Sachs ’ shares declined by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
Under the rescue plan, funds will be allocated for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage securities.
But the sum is to be paid out not at once, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option notes from the financial companies, which could be redeemed with corresponding price developments in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Share prices in Europe and the US in downward swing
The billions for banks in Europe and the US do not resolve investors' doubts.

The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000 points of the mark and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Equity markets all over the world have fallen to their knees.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government ’ s $700 billion bailout could not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first trading hour to 10,809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the index of the German Stock Exchange initially decreased by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan ’ s Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial wins.
In Hong Kong, the slope of the Seng index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed the 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused perplexity in research: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing and maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein ’ s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of soon freezing fuel pipelines now threatens her cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing and anomaly.
The Swing -by is a flight maneuver of space probes, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European American research probe Cassini and Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what the researchers have been surprised about for years: the missiles do not behave 100% as one would expect according to the ancient gravitational law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing and Anomaly.
Some experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton ’ s Institute for Advanced Study continues to firmly believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing and anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously assumes an attraction whose effect can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter accounts for a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt kidnapped tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
Six hostages are said to have been killed in a shooting before release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
ransom negotiations are already to run.
Again and again Germans come to the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are obviously free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media converging.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We are currently reviewing their state of health, "said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed surprisingly six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom, "said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a prison sentence of six years after he had been in eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he regularly captivated his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle died in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes before he performed sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
The court learned, however, that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time on a voluntary basis for the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been an eager surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she has killed herself by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I used to tie her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for their victim it must have been terrible, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still, it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so. "
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephen's father and mother, her deed over the years on her daughter.
She would otherwise have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman. "
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June will be charged under the "Public Security Law".
The man was a member of the Ministry of Defence when he lost two very confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no reference to criminal intent.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named is charged according to paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police should be charged with the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he moved contained classified assessments of Al Qaeda and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies consider B & B costs
British housing companies could cost more than £80 million after rescuing Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley ’ s 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley ’ s loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is accounted for every year by those 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now being called upon to pay some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudently.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to raise £81 million for interest rates in the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Societies, told the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the property recovery are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates are due for a full year, which could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both non-shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk will cost five pounds per litre
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five pounds per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting firm were carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the Jersey Milk wholesale price changed last year.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladesh court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ’ s bail application, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused bail concerning the indictment to have blackmailed 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina ’ s long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Avami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government should first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that, although their detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, as part of their release, whether they will continue to remain at large when they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court ’ s decision.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says that she does not have to get a deposit because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique and Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court. "
Their lawyers argue that they need bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17, said an Awami ’ s coalition leader of the party on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army had taken over the transitional government, which had supported the army, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated in Afghanistan ’ s recent anti-polio initiative because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations implemented a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban ’ s promise not to attack or hinder the vaccination of the thousands of workers.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Court of Competition ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share was distorted and that it could have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB ’ s purchase of the shares in ITV caused doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication office Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it would abandon its voting rights.
New investigation in the US Public Prosecutor ’ s Office
The American Prosecutor General has instructed a specialist investigator to deal with the cancellation of the nine prosecutors in the US in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and the former Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Specialist Nora Dannehy is now supposed to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation have appealed to investigators to hinder the judiciary.
Serious accusations, including criminal actions, have not been fully investigated or clarified, said the inspector general Glenn Fine in his report.
The vocation of a specialist investigator with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine US prosecutors from its offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak labor.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleges, which led many observers to regard the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of senior Republican Congress members, while others had refused to investigate allegations of Democratic electoral fraud.
US prosecutors are charged with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has been fired for the redundancies and has ultimately resigned.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also quit.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has critically addressed the role of Gonzales, bearing the 'main responsibility' for the redundancies, 'abandoning' his leadership role and 'extraordinarily disinterested' himself in the process.
Other officials, including President Bush ’ s former chief adviser, Karl Rove, were criticized for their lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music award ceremony "Q Award".
The singer, who next week in London will accept his special golden prize during the ceremony, said he was honoured to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track for Meat Loaf ’ s 1977 Hitalbum.
"Coldplay" lists the nominations for this year's award, after coming in four categories in the narrower selection.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such material as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute larynx inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal bracelet.
Obskure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others only convenient.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants extra place new paving to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the long-standing neighbourhood, which says it is fascinated by the short lane simply because it is one of the remains of the house block ’ s past.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the Committee for Land Use of the municipal council this month, representatives of the municipal administration and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district administrator in the municipal council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would be repaving and setting up new seats for a café where the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but did not want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the building protection department, said that it was actually the city ’ s desire to sell the street and stressed that the department ’ s task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colourful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Lawsuits: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying out city"), published part of the conversation about Extra Place, published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow impasse, which even remains dark during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rains".
With a few exceptions, the street looked just as recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the rear part of the street, not far from the door, which used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bunch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be somewhat polished up.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' positions for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Scientific Assistant in Caliphonic Studies and Senior Director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as one thinks: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama ’ s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama ’ s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than white students ” - which is true.
To close this gap, Obama ’ s educational plan specifically recommends a bilingual transition phase in education for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, Obama ’ s question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take "Sixth Street Prep" as an example, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent fourth grade students passed the state examination in math at a good level.
Also surprising were 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year in the English exam rated as good.
This amazing success was achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school is practicing the approach according to which the training takes place in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly what Obama is supposed to take into account, according to the head of the school Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialized teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, said to me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize him.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
School performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (national image associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama ’ s answer uncertain.
While agreeing that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can get Spanish".
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply, owing to fears that even the American bailout for financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
In the morning session, crude oil futures at the New York trading exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by financial turbulence on Wall Street and by strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell this month to almost $90 per barrel, and then again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were already worried, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend that should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the current last chapter of the growing crisis, Citigroup is to buy up the banks of the Wachovia Corporation, according to a government statement on Monday.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place this weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts have written in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates, and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank ’ s analysts have revised down their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and reduced their forecasts for the 2009 oil and gas price by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Shaun Ellis thought he would have seen everything after running more often than anyone else in the Jets jersey over the past eight and a half years.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumphal procession.
"I have never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touch down, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which slipped one time as an outdoor defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't make much effort," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He is a super player.
Our vote voted, no matter what people think. "
While Favre and Cole were playing, the defense took Kurt Warner apart.
Outside defender Darrelle Revis caught an accident litter and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with still 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third quarter, because the jets scored 21 points without a single one.
A lot of points were scored in a short time. "
Rested Gebrselassie beats its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to manage the 42.2 kilometres course in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59 Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2: 04: 26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear, perhaps exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he has registered for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railroad runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya changed to long-distance, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo since Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2: 06: 05.
After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and could therefore not train a week.
Obviously he has refreshed after a break and has not returned rusty.
"I am so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great. "
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he orchestrated his races excessively, avoids many world best marathon stars in general, relies too much on the race leaders, as if that were a track race, and places world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie had reached the center of the course in 1: 02: 04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the Tempomacher had left behind.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie has made his last step to separate himself from Kwambai, who is second in 2: 05: 36 and has improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2: 07: 48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2: 19: 19.
Paul Radcliff from Great Britain holds the world record of 2: 15: 25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improved her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has skillfully planned her run by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take off, but overtook after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third in 2: 25: 01.
The pride and the strains in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the excesses of the amusement parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of Afro ’ s American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city she describes - and which made her a tourist destination by taking her up in the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the federal writer project at the time of the depression - is and remains in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what escapes him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a parish member of the oldest church in the city.
It must be right. "
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Floridareiseführer changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the locations of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville ’ s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the road to the left," she wrote, "there is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new widow Dash's husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever fits with the hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson's maidens who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty, full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a lively eccentric woman who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers, in a city that even today imagines something on its venerable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he was rocking in his chair, on a backward terrace facing Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960 she was poor and her books were sold out.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big commemoration, no large public readings.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"During this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the off-seated people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car. "
In 1955, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request to force integration by calling its decision against the School Council in the Brown case "insulting rather than respecting my race."
People today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember - by hugging their teacher in the morning and hugging their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped to make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who overlooked prejudices as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements like: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand. "
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston ’ s nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves and once again made it part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came exactly at a time when Eatonville ’ s most famous daughter once again stood in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a saviour.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road maps.
"The plans of a five-lane highway animated the city, accelerated it with top speed, awakened genuine citizens' pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city ’ s self-image.
There were more and more visitors, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past anew.
Eatonville was incorporated into the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a peculiarity in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlando city centre, it can sometimes feel like a backstreet in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews a permit is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and represents black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that Hurston was becoming bigger, a higher degree of home pride was born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as much as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed like any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin ’ s nephew, the 18 year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or with the police who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most of the people who only pass through here will think," Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others, "said Alondra Kenon on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York we speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from newspaper booths and huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-like offices with glass facades, bankers, and hedge fund administrators who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst day of horror work since the 1929 stock market collapse.
The suppliers still push the metallic teas along sidewalks with loud clappers and transport trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still wander between apartments, like human packs loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for their breakfast bagel on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 pm and 7 pm.
It didn ’ t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon, owing to all the world ’ s deadlock.
Although I had decided to put my mandatory course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the money switches to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to the department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I queued.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks, and local savings banks, which have branches only in one state, and say that they treat their customers as families.
Last year, 15 of these banks went bankrupt quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion investment bank, went into bankruptcy administration, and when New Yorkers went home over the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion worth of savings, was looking for a rescuing buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shop staff who stood before me brought their bares to a bank considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial latin in recent weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese parent supermarket referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50 year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has come off our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I have changed, I no longer enter a risk."
Muslem graves desecrated during rightslide in Austria
Heinz and Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian Right Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accused right-wing extremists of desecration to a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend when extreme right-wing parties were making significant gains in the country ’ s parliamentary election.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this to be an attempt to disguise the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the grave desecration that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan was coming to an end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria, after the country slid to the right in yesterday ’ s parliamentary election.
The Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two right-wing parties who received almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their electoral claims were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz and Christian Strache, chairman of the Freedom Party, who won 18% of the votes, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burkas and even made known his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the building of mosques and minarets by arguing that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, stating that the extreme right is the country ’ s strongest political bloc, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who worry about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel lock for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam Rockstar who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Last Thursday, the Kent police were granted to impose an international travel barrier after presenting evidence to judges of Glitter ’ s criminal penalties for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
EIn Spokesman of the Court reported: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police requested permission at the Ashford District Court to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present. "
As required by the register for sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases or glitter ’ s possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in that country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimise any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the District Court of Uxbridge in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to demand that he register as a sex criminal.
Glitter had previously been detained in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, interior minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character ', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers, who renounce concentration and dedicate themselves to the interpretation, in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
Artists on the one hand
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen gaze or expressive strength of the hands concerned because they will not enter the stage.
The German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists in his project 'Flamenco -People'. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of photography of the flamenco, 'reflects the international importance of flamenco, which from day to day is increasing,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'flamenco peoples' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer will notice that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience on stage.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, one does not have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera '.
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists and dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the available material, images were created that recall classic photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, whereby the image is given the modernity and the idea of how the peasant Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots, which changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something, which becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the near future.
Well-known people in Flamenco, among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others, belong to the close selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago again and to realize it as' portraits of the veterans of sport '(' SportARTproject ').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco's people' are different, the photographer admits, 'I like very much to photograph people, to get to know them and to move me into their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas. '
The collection of flamenco portraits of today, entitled 'Flamenco', is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is just writing is' a boldness'.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project with which he deals is' a boldness' and 'everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
"If I had thought, I wouldn't have done it, but I'll do it and hope to end the novel sometime," he concluded his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and to whom most of the participants gave their voice, is compared with the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, which noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to be able to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, who want to experience from 'extraordinary lust for adventure', from 'pleasure in reading' and from 'more than before' emerges; how he writes and 'preserves discipline' to 'supplement the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentaries, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and which 'memory images' it is that form the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American novelist admitted that there is' no way 'to measure what and where to know whether books change life,' but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience, 'Vargas Llosa stressed who claims that it' produces effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers' not to leave themselves to lightness' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation '.
At the party in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfights partially failed.
After the announced bullfighters discovered that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the bullfighting test, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be concluded, was moved to yesterday morning.
With the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting test.
Thus the feast was exposed to unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfighting event could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El July, which went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience reacted in his second fight with Buh.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Morning: five minutes before ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, after which they took the flight.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officers of the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N1 and passed through the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car in order to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometers. At that moment, the drivers left the car to flee a country road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to the precise laboratory analysis and weighing of the bundles to other police stations.
Furthermore, the officials found that the number plate was' double ', so it did not match the number plate specified in the motor vehicle documents, which is why an additional arrest was made for forgery of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation in order to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station for questioning. He will be shown to the prison judge in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear were arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she tried quite strangely to get out of her parking gap in Montecito, reported California traffic police spokesman to the magazine 'People'.
The witness explained in detail that Locklear 'pushed through the gas pedal after 4: 30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and when she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses several times'.
A little later, the witness, who had probably not seen the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'fear of Locklears'.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
'She seemed to be unoriented ', so they took the policemen to a special drug and alcohol centre to do a test.
According to a reporter, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'Following the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined, and sent to a local detention centre at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian United Left is responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and United Left MP, today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the Seville City Hall, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take over the responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out what approach the party must have towards the one who, until now, sits as a councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the Chair of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations into the regulatory violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should be given maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has' a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
'Sangre de mayo ': Heroes' Book of Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' is the revised version of the Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in film photography, with about 15 million euros of investment for filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried 'to present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci today explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
'Sangre de mayo 'with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and will be shown later on Telemadrid as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that his' childhood dream 'was fulfilled thanks to this work, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second centenary on November 2 in Madrid. Especially because the story is based on' Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming offers Garci, as he added, the 'unique opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding garments to depict the image of 'confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight because the people had been lagged behind by the fight for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to calculate the financing as with 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost all his career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual way of working: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom one must first rehearse before one begins to shoot and for those who had not done a casting he appeared 'humiliating' and giving respect, 'a part of the profession of the director of the film consists in providing help in the theater and in the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar ’ s candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represented Spain this year in front of the Academy of Hollywood is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' nor, finally, the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'In the beginning, you believe that you are working for the offspring, later you realize that it is only for prosperity, and now you are satisfied when you have produced another film, 'Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville venerates a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first female fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and stood up for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón fascinated the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me. '
'We don't try to tell about her life, but to keep her Esprit, 'said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, 'The Dance of the Butterfly' seemed to me like Guajira, or 'The Dance of the Serpent' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area, 'she claims.
The production anticipates two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel once again at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco champion Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work together with one of her former pupils.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work and I feel very honoured. '
The production also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes on the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in whom he constantly falls in love.'
In this work, one also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
'I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular epoch and whose works nowadays nobody knows more and therefore she appreciates even less, 'Bayón claims.
The performance will take place today at 20: 30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of the two.
Thus, 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house of the museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez and Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez:' Aquel chopo de luz ', which opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and will be presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez and Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian poet better known.
The USA can imagine itself badly without Paul Newman
'Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them. '
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'SensationsReporterin', and from the then prevailing performance of the American cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America until Newman came with his inspiring performance and followed her.
Look what it cost him to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew that he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow to everyone.
'What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a big friend, 'said Robert Redford weeping,' my life and my country were the greatest droppings of his life. '
Nobody was afraid neither to make themselves ridiculous nor to exaggerate.
As the 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and market collapse prevails, in which the US Americans' crushed self-esteem is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people remain who can be admired, you do not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied quasi a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and, like various losses, suffered both profits: from the Foundation, which has dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of trouble for it to prevail against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of astonishment beats haushoch over Hollywood, regardless of nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have all left the greatest of us, 'affirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high standards of righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced one time and was then married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who he was faithful to, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a fillet at home? 'he often chastised himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters have the same opinion on earth as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud of any as of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandpa and the philanthropist, 'they say.
The streets of Madrid are deficient for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
She was called the perfect street, and according to my assessment, she was the worst street with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if we were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could examine it, that would clearly not have happened.
But, let us go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the ticketholes that allow you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you do it, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams).
So not.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going there only because of that) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it the case that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So well, things like this are a little bit compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks behind, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
Furthermore, in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the outcome was stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect street, this street would never come to mind.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time to come.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and the human interaction, an entity of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however able to perform some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft that is a route planner to move on the campus of the company).
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place those present after the conversations in groups.
In the presentation video 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not belonging to the group that leads to her conversation and that no company employee is.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things that it can focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft ’ s change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial trash, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or another feature and 'Tools' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right that the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google appeared on the net, Chrome was part of the theory that it was Google ’ s first step to compete with Windows.
Many people pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That is true.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his' death ', not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention each time to the operating system, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the 'windows'.
What is the half of the computer used for existing applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate its online banking services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt. I bring a small example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the soft drinks machine a sign is attached: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for research on the net.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 is delayed.
It will be released not at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the option to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark simultaneously.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start to list the countless stars' appearances, we can fall back on the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard that had lifted heavy weights in a travelling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English speakers call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of his great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend tells that the origin of the name is connected with sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel 'overlooks all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex trim and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable), which these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, T-shirts with stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is a pity to use them as underwear.
They are very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate '
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicate, but full of joie de vivre.
The brothers and sisters Gruz are currently taking their new fashion activities very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her domicile and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion, which the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn / winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, as well as the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You are working for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50 and 60 years; there we find many ideas.
I like going through a city and watching women dressed in clothes, combining their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many things in common.
Since I was a little boy, I was thrilled by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to rummage around my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in classes and rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good at the same time.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real role of actor.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you have become 30, did you not fall into crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty year old, I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I am not afraid because of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was small, and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, do you think about becoming a mother, or not?
For a long time now, I have known that I am becoming a mother because that is what my body demands and I also want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not concerned.
I will convey great happiness to my child and educate it with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and which were shot last year.
That is exactly the way it is and I would very much like them to be presented to the public.
As a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago you appeared on the walkway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Is good, say something like that.
It is not that I went to the walkway to dress.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothes from our collection for mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People do not know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they are not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to attend the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can be relapsed because of the alcohol level, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installs in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office. According to her, it is a pilot ’ s project, which will last for a year.
The purpose is to rehabilitate the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Prosecutor General ’ s Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of drivers, who were reported more than once because of driving under alcohol influence, sat back at control.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhausted air and prevents autostart when the driver has made alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the US in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices will prevent up to 65% of breaches in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a regular reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law, which is necessary for the law enforcement process, is required.
The device is not yet available in Spanish markets, even though it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers ’ Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without peep toes'
With British punctuality, at 17: 40, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, traveling with the prince and princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but her rays still forced her to use her hand as a parasol to see the royal couple leaving the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other Authorities
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can take at the airport at this time no people is from here or so
No, she is the Spanish, but she has lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh so, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the naval, who surrender Ehrensalve.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps she was informed that it is expected a thunderstorm in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, awaits a reporter from Mexican television, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no much outstanding fashion designer and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton and Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, yesterday saw her drawings in the shop window of the Mango store on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m ².
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have happened which are connected with the fact that one would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairman at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by pain because his brother died recently, teased himself together. He dressed the suit of the fashion house and dressed some jewellery of ELAH, which were breathtaking. He held on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a Cavalier, so that he ended up with the baron of Rotschild without jackets, because they borrowed jackets to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hastened to the shop and had a pants and a shirt which she herself modelled, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got into excitement, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us her son's photos on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not 1000, but a way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, they are all collected in a book where it says how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that the current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of turning off from the world of work.
But the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress means' 1001 possibilities to relax 'and so comes the rest, which mediates the book, into the bookstores of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Whoever thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods offered are how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes proposed that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline no longer rises in your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, switch off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occasionally occur (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often relationships are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for that.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fibers, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one quietly speaks in individual words, whispers or it can be quite an opposite (cries, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to get advice from a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus comes about.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it, it is connected with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to raise the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When speaking occurs in your sleep, you try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will remember nothing that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
If you think about it, if it shows itself scared after a pair of appearances, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child has for fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
Thus you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that they are careful about the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn ’ t tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes much fear.
So, don ’ t worry, it ’ s nothing bad, that ’ s a moment that takes only a few minutes.
Illhäuser... finally
After a long thirst course, Illhäuser is finally on a successful course on the pitch.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks gained numerous scoring chances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers had trouble showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot passed just past the angle, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a long-distance shot, then brain with a high-pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the center of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with two chances of scoring won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who stood exactly right to take a ball again, which had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the illhäusische goal shooter should not be able to enjoy his luck long and about twelve minutes later to be sent to the bench, whereby his team mates had to continue playing numerically inferior.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face major problems for an illhaese-like elf, who only withdrew a little to 'consolidate' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, where the ball passed very close to the latte after a great mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to visit the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President ’ s visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee set up by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in the face of the extreme increase in diesel prices, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesman for the Elyséepalast David Martinon, 'the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive again and to secure the conditions of employment and the pay of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by fishermen.
Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused congestion of almost ten kilometres in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle and île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was bordered by a barrier.
Already on Monday, the seafarers expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire and Atlantique dissolved in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
The from Boulogne censored Mer decided to wait for the meeting to take place on Wednesday in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
Indeed, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee must decide on the responses to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not yield to any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 due to the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinematographer and the committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer anticipates 215 aircraft delivered, despite the impending recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world ’ s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
The aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft in the first half of the year.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday issue, the American International Group, which has been financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering spending more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that it has received.
AIG is ready to steer the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its life insurance at international level and its pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
One of the assets that AIG could possibly separate from is its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of reinsurers Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT continues to explain.
With regard to these sales, no final decision has been made, the FT continues.
AIG must make sales as quickly as possible to repay the loans over 85 billion approved by the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning of the meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic fall in prices on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives rejected Paulson ’ s plan to rescue banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Dow Jones 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final results, the index is down by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, mainly in technology, and the widespread Standard & Poors 500 index has dropped by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Following the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the Bank Rescue Plan, which was supposed to restore stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been struck at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 for it the deputies refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the means, for which he had asked.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here a bad picture is circulated, which represents the Congress as unable to accept a plan ', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan, 'she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come' too late '.
"If the project is indeed doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the Fed ’ s task (the American central bank, ed.) and other central banks to get a grip on the crisis, which would even more restrict credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, emphasizing even more the sense of extreme urgency that 'every day that goes by brings with it the ruin of a financial company' in the United States'.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to purchase the banking operations of Wachovia by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing 'not just an American but a global crisis', added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the state treasury within ten years has decreased Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and the revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in the first television match
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the Republican and Democratic elections in this television duel, which should be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain ’ s performance, although highly appreciable, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in electoral polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup institute, of which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to which Obama is at the forefront with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat is clearly making the better figure.
With 39%, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls among the still undecided voters, i.e. those that matter now, while, according to an CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his competitor Joseph ∑ at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Trudeau
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts', but warned this weekend Bill Clinton.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to focus on his undeniable experience in foreign policy, clearly underlining his opponent's' naivety 'with regard to these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... 'he stressed several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself in a short and precise way, without letting himself be removed from the text.
He focused on his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
‘ McCain has still not understood, Obama on the other hand ’, this weekend, a democratic election spot opposed, in which Republicans were accused of failing to grasp the full extent of the crisis that is burdening the ‘ American on the street ’.
‘ During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you, ’ Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words' middle class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage, which the Americans consider to be the most appropriate way to save the economy even on the brink of abyss.
'Next week could be a decisive turning point ', estimated yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama ’ s ‘ good economic instincts ’ with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is' the final share of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain '.
Having reiterated that he would probably even manage to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, Illinois Senator pointed out that creating the country ’ s potential energy independence and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, would be his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant from 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates were mindful of the issues raised by the plan to rescue the financial market of more than $700 billion (€470 billion), passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that an election took place in Minsk? '
Young people and opposition activists demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations in the Minsk Market Square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they did not even choose: 'What good is that if they do what they want with my voice anyway', says a young person.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to the foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, is prepared to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the non-granting of visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting ', regretted Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006 and leader of the Pro-Europa Movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and in our case that is the executive.
When members of the opposition enter Parliament because they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent '.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that turnout figures appear to be too high, and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Did you notice that an election took place?, asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
Nobody was in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to respond to the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night lowers again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From the blood that became safe again
Yesterday, Hema and Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of their foundation, and their president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema and Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained public confidence, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross ’ s blood donor service were contaminated with the HI and the Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched in February 1994 a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to report, several provinces set up a committee at the time to develop a new system to manage canned blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to reports from Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema and Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and Canadian blood society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
'In 1998, when Hema and Quebec started their work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood canning system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence, 'she says, before she proudly stresses that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population had Quebec's confidence in Hema.
Dr. Décary, however, maintains that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new species of Creutzfeldt's disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its foundation in 1998.
'And we did not have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we referred to one of the main directives of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is evidently the case with the Creutzfeldt and Jakob of the disease, which manifests itself through a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, blood was not assumed by people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more precise method of detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which allow the detection of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period, which takes place between the time at which the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not see it, was substantially reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV infected blood.
In other words, this means that 12 million canned blood would have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema and Quebec distributed between 400,000 and 500,000 canned blood each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case where HIV was transmitted via a blood conserve occurs.
I think you can feel comfortable nowadays when you get or prescribe blood transfusion to restore your health, 'says the head of the Hema department of Quebec.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
One never knows which pathogens can enter the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya -virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil -virus, is transmitted through insects through the blood.
We need to continuously monitor ', continues Dr. Décary, before she stresses that, in addition to a safe supply, Hema and Quebec must also provide adequate supply.
'Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
As treatments to combat cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebecs suitable for donation. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and fulfils the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted, for example because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from donation for one year.
'With these 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of stocks are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network when they grow older and can no longer donate blood.
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep it and make it become regular donors.
Today life is so hectic that one rarely finds the time to spend an hour donating blood, 'regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema provides Quebec not only with blood preserves, but also with human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are almost exclusively used for serious fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema and Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank Quebecs.
The umbilical cord, which used to be considered a biomedical waste, contains abundant blood in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousands of umbilical cord blood samples, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
"We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it ', because Hema's Quebec lack the means to offer this complex and costly program in all of Quebec's hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in semifinals
Yesterday, thanks to a 3-to-1 victory (4-to-3 with all goals), Montreal ’ s Impact qualified against Seattle ’ s Sounders at the second and decided to play the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the total score was the final round of the USL ’ s first league elimination games.
Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half without goal for both the one and the other side, the leaders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who set out Matt Jordan for the sounders.
Remember that in the first game of the pre-season and re-season series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattles had brought a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-final Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday night Thunder was able to compensate for a 3-to-1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4-to-3 victory, but the whitecaps nevertheless entered the semifinal round with a total score of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are fixed today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The Canadian team ’ s number one trio is ready to tackle the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed ahead the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire, leading to a 3-to-2-victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this winning game, the fourth of the tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shootout.
'I am not yet ready, warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable. '
'He has fixed himself too much on it in the first half, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause. '
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party came to an end, Jean Charest went to Quebec yesterday, after Jean and Talon, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in today ’ s partial election.
'Move the course of our last major border in the north ': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis by visual means, following the guidelines.
During his lecture a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens turned spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large resources such as during the parliamentary term.
Incidentally, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned recently in the Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is' a jewel with enormous potential ', but did not mention any date, investment amounts or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At most, there are some views of what could be done more: in particular on hydropower, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, benefiting from the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest, the North possesses' nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This' area twice as large as France '' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is in us, 'he stressed, as to show clearly that he is trying to realize a national founding space.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It's ours, it's our future, 'he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is there, I will resume this position on behalf of the government ', he said.
Furthermore, 'with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the North', he said and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be passable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister says that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the indigenous and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very cautious about them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PEK MEP of Ungava), have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) occupies an important place, has started the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'create a common vision'.
Furthermore, the development of the North will be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan Nord will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
'Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development ponds.
This was, by the way, one of the repeatedly raised topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage ’ s takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power station to Adélard ’ s Godbout dam.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro's Quebec, through Lesage, who has achieved the silent revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who has made James's Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future, 'said Jean Charest.
To the press he referred to another, this time conservative, project, namely the programme 'Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Hydroelectric Dam Eastmain1a and Ruper, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
'That remains among us, but I plan to be there, 'he entrusted to his party members, which caused by those suppression storms.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that in 2008, and certainly in 2009, there would be no elections, has not yet excluded the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible to him by law.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform of nationalistic plans, above all 'objectives concerning the Constitution', which were easily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the 'peculiarity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition was sceptical about the guidelines of the North Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has revived the policy for the development of the North of Quebec, which the government of Landry introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, 'we would have been much further today', Mrs Marois judged Françoise Mercure at the side of her candidate for the election in Jean Trudeau Talon (where the election is taking place today).
The ADQ has expressed its support for the government ’ s adoption of a plan north.
"But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea," said party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A Distinguished Land
Mr Vic Toews, former 'Justice' minister (what irony) in Harper's cabinet was it that last summer allowed itself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only government that has not brought home its compatriot caught in the Guantanamo concentration camp from all the countries concerned.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things he was accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, is breaking its word and allowing a child soldier to vegetate under inhumane conditions.
The only one to descend to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to them that, after so many years of torment, a young adult will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but here we are witnessing a treacherous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', that word that Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and that sounds so vague from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no longer any morality: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, at the mercy of a head of government who until today is only supported by the minority (may he belong to the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they can find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this slogan, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice Director General of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold.
It confirms, and pursues an Orwellian logic, that the world ’ s largest gold extraction company sought a libel lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small medium-sized publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘ public transparent debate ’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of libel actions, but on the law.
As expected, Mr Garver completely concealed this fundamental difference.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin everyone who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
No matter how the trial proceeds, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal battles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable regulation, which makes the opposite side mouth-dead and also deterrents anyone who dares to deal again with the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick works gold, debates are usually conducted in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through blows.
It would therefore have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent audit teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, while disregarding the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, this word in the vice-president world only includes the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is prepared to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gagging complaint (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just made a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she demands that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom to conduct academic research and the truth that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate lawsuit by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this type of unjustified lawsuits.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans, and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main issues are: better control of Members of Parliament over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of public funds used, new orders to curb the number of houses paved for payment arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the management staff of the supported companies.
The American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative, Senator Judd Gregg, who was present at the negotiations announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective ', said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
'It was all about protecting the real economy and the American people from the curriculum crisis on Wall Street, 'the democrat said.
‘ This is the fundamental point: unless we do, the trauma, chaos and unrest in American daily life will be enormous, ’ said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were late in the negotiations, were more likely to be supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to hit them in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain orders to the agreement, especially those to allow owners to keep their homes, and those that affect the salaries of senior employees of the state-rescued companies.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is not what you could congratulate.
But these measures are necessary ', he said on American television channels.
When he was asked on another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The principles that I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable, 'he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using taxpayers ’ money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and eventually led to a freeze in financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MEPs who failed last week the first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies should only be secured and not bought by the government in distress, the impasse is believed to escape.
To round off the perspective for everyone in Congress, a decree has also been added stating that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it would then be able to levy new taxes to reclaim its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by the Congress in a new vote.
In return for its help, Washington will receive shares in the supported companies, which will pay dividends in the case of profits, and which it will be able to sell again if the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the seizure proceedings concerning the apartments linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for the repayment and severance payments paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate to vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
Indeed, more votes were raised yesterday against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
'Clearly Washington does not understand us,' said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, to his constituents.
'Yes, we have a major financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not that which consists in asking taxpayers to pay '.
Democratic deputy Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucus of skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four-hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: we ask Congress not to be pressured, and carefully consider which path to take ', he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe have once again been shown that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who has been in great difficulty since she lost EUR 2 billion (US $2.9 billion) in the crisis due to high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
We have a right to vote and influence in the bank to compensate for this.
This is exactly what savers and households value, now that uncertain times are coming. '
During that time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British Government was currently nationalizing another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank ’ s branches and customer accounts.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to nationalize the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was long his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and obvious talent have kept him from a position of power that brings the really terrible monsters into the world.
But what a long time ago!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 as a result of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the canvas, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blowing of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality feature.
After all, it reflected a whole country that fell in love with the self-made man, with the fighter who was injured in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 50's and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon also in the cinema.
This same man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, who became second in 1979 at the 24 hour championship race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a flagship education.
With him also the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and oversensitive star in the glamour of the show business disappear, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman ’ s death put the cinema lovers in turmoil this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing with him.
Then again the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Katze auf dem heißen Blechdach, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter past memory (1990) is awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean after whose death he was resumed and which made Newman well known in 1956.
This likeable Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through time was he.
Still he.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth know him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of a hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen in 1994.
With a last role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinematographers who withdrew early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, its assets, its pomp and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him as a living challenge to underplaying, not without humour, when he judged his overly expressive achievements.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time only so.
But he played Sunnyboys more rarely than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or despair, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping off and his rebellion.
As a director Newman revealed unknown pages of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness to him in 1984.
During the flood of honours that flowed through Newman yesterday, his close friend and former weapons companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared extremely moved: 'His presence has improved my life and that country.'
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the drifting down of Hollywood, is now moving.
We often saw him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, sauces, pastries or other foods, and we thought this was quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his Foundation for Children in Need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman was engaged until the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and until the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honour to be here. '
And for us it was an honour to persecute the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the billing factory of Zuschlag & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations begin in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The accused are accused in particular of participating in organised crime, as well as gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including counterfeiting.
According to the public prosecutor, the funds raised from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered by counterfeit invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to have partially been channelled into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private coffers of individual.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tendering funds were received, and the clubs should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices are said to have been falsified.
The billing blocks were bought by Józsefváros at the market, the circular seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue invoices was decided on that round trip north of Lake Balaton to which István Lados was sent by János supplement.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He demanded invoices for consumption in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, as well as the self-government of Budapest based on these templates.
The majority of these bills are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the Constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "Exploration Tour" was a beer bar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company states that such a large group would not have all at once integrated into the restaurant.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious defects in form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed according to the bill.
There were apparently no limits to the imagination of the counterfeiters when it came to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in whose accounting documents the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not appear at all according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told the hvg.hu, he immediately realized that these were fake documents when the prosecutor submitted him documents during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrect on the stamp".
And further: Apart from faults in form, the fact that the company is supposed to have accommodated one hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people was also wrong.
The restaurant had also been mentioned on the invoice catering, and was no longer in operation for a long time.
The diligent counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted offers only travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary ’ s travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company ’ s accounting practice.
Furthermore, as was known in the course of the investigation, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel bureaucracy services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The total value added tax was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company charges only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and employees only issue machine invoices, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "accountants" was that in one case they had indicated "goods transport" as a rendered service, although this is not offered by the company specialized in investment advice, the prosecutor's office informed.
Further formal errors - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be unmasked as forgeries.
Likewise in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose managers asserted that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made by the counterfeiters of the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass lawyer therefore stated that he did not issue the invoices himself.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, in an amount of about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, persuaded Collab Kft. to issue fictitious bills.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with the contract and Co. In 2003, the company is said to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which related to unperformed services.
However, there was also no payment transaction, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which the data subjects have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants comprises persons directly associated with the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of IT components in the total value of HUF in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigative authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has stood during the investigation to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent value.
The companies Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos -Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatov's explicit wish.
In reality, however, none of these companies was active, which according to the accused was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company ’ s foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million to the organizations on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor ’ s office assumes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice amount as well as VAT.
Kubatov is even said to have misused Szi and Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were settled by Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts in an expedient way.
To cover up this, they submitted five fictitious invoices from the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
Incidentally, these invoices were secured during the search of the Árpád Kemecsei office in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to confess the procedure of counterfeiting, which was already made before the prosecutor ’ s office.
A sensation could be, if the main defendant János supplement to a comprehensive confession decides.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had already promised on several occasions to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether, in return, the contract is prepared to assume responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that the supplement now plays the "offended" after his requests were met with relief from the detention and house arrest on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage and have not compensated for it, stand at large, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The Psychology of Surrendering - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the file offering.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play Lotto while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent's overbid plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have carried out additional investigations into the pursuit of money.
In this case, three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their inserts.
Another group was also promised $15 reward if they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis was on one on winning, while the other on losing.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "anti-losing" playing group were ready for higher missions than those in the control or "gain" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviour observed at auctions with the pleasure of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready "- said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor visiting?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated at one hundred thousand in Germany, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, vaginal secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to vaccinate against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two or three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die annually from hepatitis B, much more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people are in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen secretly destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20 to 30 years.
Timely prevention, such as regular inspection, is therefore essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
As the disease is already detectable during routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognised in due time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time by patient representatives worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
The latest research shows that religious faith acts as a kind of "painkiller", which is supposed to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: The British newspaper Telegraph reported on the extent to which faith in God influences human pain.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
With the help of a brain Scan technology, it was even proven that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which not only scientists but also philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
When the test subjects were tried, a sparkling device was connected to the left hand, which released the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a painting of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci ’ s image because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt reassuring.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and in that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were supposed to see either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared for", and they had felt "calm and peace".
During the viewing of the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo ’ s work before their eyes.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be caused by other strongly acting images, even among atheists, but one would have to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practising the faith should change our personality and do so in many cases," Wright said.
According to these outstanding results, the only question remains is what effect a Madonna ’ s image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you communicate about you
On the occasion of their tenth birthday, Google is right to say that it is in people ’ s pockets as well as in their heads in the sky: it knows where people spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And with that still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managing directors of Google.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets align: These would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google ’ s main goal was to collect even more personal information about users, bringing them closer to the company ’ s original goal of “ordering all information from this world. ”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of global change, Google was still only at the beginning of information gathering.
When asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet search the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses, from which was searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and to use it later, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and based on the same logic also the so-called "Recommendations", with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services due to the earlier preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in the case of data abuse - "If you look at what I am doing" - some people are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the company ’ s represented potential power that is frightening, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or rebellion against power that many Internet users encounter with rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an event, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google presented information to the Brazilian government collected from the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of paedophilia.
However, users with personal rights could still breathe in May, when Google successfully brought the FBI to justice together with the civil rights organization EFF: hence Google cannot be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request with any point of the constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago. However, the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms list, was withheld retrospectively for two months.)
So Google ’ s image remains controversial: those who refuse to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google ’ s services, scourge the company with the indignation that is due to the conservative companies.
Indes sees the American "Geek's culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both are struggling for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes for its users and makes its services available free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet in a razor-sharp way - a relationship that has been put into focus, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, that is, users deliberately leave traces behind and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average adolescent can manage his profile simultaneously on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect to each other through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. Moreover, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries geared to Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos last night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend enjoyed herself, or the employee is dismissed because he makes air in his blog only too honestly his anger about the management - one thing is certain: The term "privacy" has meanwhile been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he reveals of himself - one could, for example, formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And who tries to keep something secret, or even to bypass Google ’ s monopoly, can do that gladly – like Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google ’ s search engine, but deliberately leaves no trace.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but also the online application of Google, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
Public opinion, however, waits until Google shows its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca ‑ Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords / AdSense ’ s advertising space threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, and the services introduced more and more quickly are causing headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the management of the company rejected a protest by the employees completely after the fees of the company ’ s own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive. However, all this seems almost mild against Google even kneeling in front of the Chinese government in 2006 and agreeing to an agreement that all dissident hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again strongly change: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project now assumes proportions that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the system "health", which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, physicians and problems.
And the fact that Google is building up a genetic database already delivers the stuff to the next generation of Sci and Fi authors - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian manner a future in which a human being becomes terribly close thanks to Google related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd to eliminate traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people suspected of helping to remove the traces, the spokesman of the Borsod Police Commissioner announced on Tuesday.
The young people were constrained and are currently charged with the aid.
According to the news agency MTI, they are two girls who defend themselves at large.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed.
The investigation revealed that the 23 year old had owed a 53 year old a larger amount of money.
But the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a premises in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden on the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon of the crime and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around EUR 200 million or 5 billion Czech crowns for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange shares.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the securities in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", Poland's offers contain the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5 billion kroner.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-worsening international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European papers already spoke of the "second September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American President, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to unite his own party in favour of the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the milliard-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11."
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush ’ s plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not have any political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air, precisely at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, for example, the Geneva "Day Scoreboard".
While some countries could still provide rescue packages to their troubled financial institutions, and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers ’ money.
But if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, the EU ’ s member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weaker financial institutions, recalls the Viennese "Der Standard". Moreover, according to the newspaper, the concerns are more and more realistic that after the Americans, European taxpayers now have to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
The "saviors" would not have to "wave" immediately with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to maintain in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention if not to imitate the obstacle to sensors from nature?
For example, that of bees.
An amazing project was presented at CEATEC in Japan, where the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in the creation of new accident avoidance systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology and PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it were not so, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The entire process must reflect the bees ’ behavior when they evade other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to bees, dodging cannot take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, namely only in the direction of the twisting of the tires.
While the bees are open to endless possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotary motion or the acceleration and braking of the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium and polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy-efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium and ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on data processing, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process some inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction by means of previous maneuvers, so that it constantly takes only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which, according to Nissan, will be standard in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS ’ s satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinner child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion bailout package is in place, which will be applied in several stages and aims to buy the banks ’ bad loans.
In the first passage half of money should be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, the congressmen after multi-day debates on an agreement on the 700 billion dollar rescue package, reported Reuters.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Chamber of Deputies, saying that the agreement must only be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - supported the compromise reached on the bailout package.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. ” According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about overthrowing the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not trigger a flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the bill for stabilising the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on its turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, Speaker of the White House.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush Administration ’ s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on buying lazy, load-bearing securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion dollars will be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday, which will be spent on buying credit burdened, bad securities, and a further $100 billion will be decided by the President.
The programme will be reviewed by a separate Commission, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the Congress.
In accordance with the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: at the same time, it can buy bad loans, mortgages and securities burdened with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be done both in an auction and directly.
The law enables the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds, and companies pay corresponding fees for the damage to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the funds needed so that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for large-scale purchases of bad funds, their insurance, or avoiding a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, says Paulson.
But the leaders of the troubled banks, now dependent on state aid, can expect the government to cut their clearance payments, which are called "Golden Handshake" in overseas Slang.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry is bought at an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed, unless the retired bank manager is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of bad loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managers ’ salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake agreements are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers ’ salaries are regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank are better off.
The draft law stipulates that the President will have to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
But there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were driven forward by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices up further
Like the Central Statistics Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1% higher than those in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% compared to last year ’ s prices.
Due to domestic and export price changes, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices rose only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Also the selling prices of the processing industry rose only little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily in bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, and in shoes prices were 2.5 percent higher.
Higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials considerably increased the prices of chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
The price decrease was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the processing industry year-on-year, crude oil processing prices have risen most (32.4%).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11%.
A price decline was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic market, the highest price increase (0.7 percent) was recorded in the asset goods sector in August.
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices were 0.3% higher, while in the energy and processing sector they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sector (16.8%) compared to the same period in 2007.
Sectors producing consumer goods have seen a price increase of 6.8%, while asset goods have seen a price reduction of 1.4%.
Industrial export prices measured in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decline of 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency grew weaker by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, 7.1 percent to the dollar, and, compared to August 2007, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and even 15.9 percent to the dollar.
No longer a visa to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American Visa Agreement to enter into force around 12 January, as the Secretary of State told the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in good time."
However, she also stressed that the new system will not provide entry permits, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present the "Mid-Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
The congress and government representatives announced on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the banks ’ rescue package after days of marathons.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain – both claim to be better suited than their opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain ’ s High, which gave him the presentation of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Trudeau after the Republican Convention, has also melted away.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported with.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete".
In an interview given to the broadcaster ABC McCain explained: "We will all have hard to jaw (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative".
The Republican senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a supervisory commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of the clearances for top managers - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas Obama was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so comments "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine located on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's Revolution exterminates its fathers".
In the opinion of the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber duo took over its offices.
The Christian Social have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as for Angela Merkel.
The CSU ’ s disaster did not come quite surprisingly, but something came to an end on Sunday, which, however, had already emerged quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 per cent and fell under the fifty percent mark for the first time since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in other words in the much-cited Stoiber era.
Last but not least, the modernization carried out by the CSU in the federal state has wiped out its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time had a considerable rate of appreciation. However, the secularization, the educational success, the admission of East and North Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria to the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain without effect.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and unconventional.
What is striking is that in recent weeks the classical groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with high school leaving certificates such as university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU decreased to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily Wiener Tageszeitung reports in her article "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained on coalition issues" on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the elections.
The Left Party wants to negotiate with the Left Party.
The Liberal Party forbids the Social Democrats from interfering in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussion in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly let their cards look into.
Speaking at the head of the coalition, Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the coalition party.
The Left Party wants to show that cooperation between both parties is possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question as to whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current Federal Chancellor ’ s chief vice-chancellor.
As he said, voters would have voted off Molterer ’ s Bowl.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
Molterer has however reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in the inner concerns of the Left Party.
Whether his party goes into opposition, or into coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, organised this year by the EU Presidency of the Council France.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz, MEP of the European People's Party, drew attention in particular to the education segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of the law affecting Roma children, and was also the biggest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by French Employment and Social Affairs Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the EP press office reports to Fidesz, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, the Roma are being driven out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education only a small part of them can achieve a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right that has a key role to play in asserting other human rights.
Investments in early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU member states.
In the view of Members, it is important that these connections become aware of the widest possible circle - that is, Roma and not Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and VAT they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be stopped" - said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach by the European Union is needed to speed up the desegregation process in the education sector, and to that end proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give children Roma the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," said Járóka.
Since last year's congress in Berlin, the Summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace for Time
End of October the fate of the fallen duo Huber Beckstein is decided
In spite of the election debacle, there are no heads at the moment; the personnel debates were postponed at the head of the Bavarian CSU.
Head of state Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17% loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
But the much-peeled duo already let us see that it does not want to stick to their armchairs.
With this they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career high point - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "single government" in Bavaria, generating 18% of German GDP.
Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party ’ s internal restructuring, the potential successor of Hubert, vice-president and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst ∑ will also be involved in the exploration team, which conducts exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing “free voters ”.
One irony of fate is that with the list of "free voters" Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-German Stoiber appearances the Huber and Beckstein duo first exploited, in order to then mercilessly smear the purposeful politician.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has hitherto pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role. Former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman of the Council called 28 September the "most bitter day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made some poisonous remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a great deal to success at national level in 2005, is not resumed with a joint effort, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the CSU ’ s loss of territory will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
But what is relative is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946 with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110's 0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MEP made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that it is illegal to count the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
For decades, the legislature of the ten million inhabitants of the country has had no opposition. Nevertheless, before yesterday ’ s elections, the counterparty gathered under the name “United Democratic Forces ” (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, this time would“ allow ” some members of the opposition in Parliament.
That is why the ODS has even withdrawn from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on Russia as a result of rising prices in the import of natural gas. Indeed, credit has even been absorbed to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the country ’ s leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. Thus, in the context of the opposition ’ s expectations, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have embarked on the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections caused a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was more on the positive movements, rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - and therefore opposition figures are not likely to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
In spite of all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners, for example, were set free, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces South of Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federative state on paper, has regarded the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich said to our paper.
In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid of even leaving only one opposition member in parliament".
The opposition does not plan any protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have many problems to contend with here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities set us in the way of selling stones, but nevertheless I see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich in allusion to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the" social security "which is reminiscent of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," said Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the actions, not the words." Therefore, the lack of the opposition is proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
From today on, the measure against which those Schlaumeier will enter into force who first stamp and then go coffee drinking during working hours.
The new anti-laziness law was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
">" Rotating doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services, "said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism ", Brunetta underlines once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during working hours; stop with coffee or croissant.
In this regard Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracles".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
of Rome the minister announces that "within three months the absence of civil servants has been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60.000 people per year are more present at work".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italian public administration
"Their wages and dynamics - according to the Minister - were twice as large as the private sector over the last 8 years and well above the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to work against the Brunetta Decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for the Civil Service profiles himself with figures about lower abstentions at work - so writes the Consumer - the people of the 'active laziness' continuously grows.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree. "
In particular, there is a fight before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the obligatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day 2,500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain lifelong invalids.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th national day for victims of accidents at work, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data distributed by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is", confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention of jobs, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of victims and to raise public awareness".
"An outrageous" Basta "has risen up to this; understandable in the case of tragedies that, in terms of their magnitude, trigger some vortices in the media and public participation. However, the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of the school framework on the part of young people who nurture the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness; we must put in place and improve a legislative norm.
On the one hand, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths is an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards firm rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high", emphasizes President of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this" positive tendency "to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you believe that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary - according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already beginning at school ".
"A further effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is needed towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency ".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for workers' victims" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which from time to time are decided by a legislator".
Mp3 -Player under indictment: risk of hearing damage
Listening to lute music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cited the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU in a report published in Brussels today.
"The report - as stated in a note - makes it clear that 5% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years weekly longer than an hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - it is said on the part of the Eu - there is a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information common.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology ".
Brussels had appointed the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists, concluding the EU Communication, confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the Commission, together with the other members of the Eu and those affected, will now investigate the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices".
At the moment, there is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, the concern about the damage that could result from too much noise.
One can very restrict this damage by using solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of noise exposure.
In its report, the Eu's Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to loud (louder than 89 decibels) music only five hours a week, the statutory limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
That is 5% to 10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We are starting today, we are due to be over in March, and we are due to take stock in June.
This is the procedure laid down by Kapitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome. This morning, the Commission met in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spa.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the city council and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it", - stresses Alemanno. "It will offer proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose politically responsible the city council and the council remain.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will be dissolved again, as such a project must have a temporary end point.
In June - as the Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work carried out by the Commission ".
Anyone who questions the Commission's competence, given that it is not binding, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, it delivers quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view, so as to work seriously in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city ".
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to specifying the following: "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think. It will employ the best heads of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to allow our city a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step towards the future".
According to the Mayor of Rome, a future that "will not only be confined to the current municipal borders, but will look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama - the First Anti-American President? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who is keen to be seen as independent, has written: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the economy of the USA by his decisions, and who maintained relations with the hostile Islam (and still does this as a private man today) ".
The attacks on Obama are becoming increasingly violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will have the highest position of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators! ".
Actually, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: it is only in the election cabin that we will know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here a mentality of the USA appears, which until the last time was kept hidden.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our cross, whether for Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before - only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the weak point for the majority of Bush.
The one who will take his place faces a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers one can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control over the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the general credibility of the information on competent persons.
They do not feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Added to this are the major problems caused by the cuts made by the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved - according to the interviewed journalists - if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive senior press journalists believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the Executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine what direction the web is heading in.
The most important publishing groups are paving the way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they want to join the new technology in the hope of "bringing something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between newsroom editors and reporters who work for it.
56% of editors-in-chief at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety in work".
The plant managers, who are afraid to lose their work within three years, amount to 47% at national level.
It is 30% for journalists.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", ed.) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it is the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, employers offer as it is popular to them and so it will be a matter of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief very often gets very high wages, the editor on the other hand can sometimes only get 10000 euro per month, in addition to pension and insurance funds.
As far as holidays are concerned, it is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they admit, are often "sick" during the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: JUSTICE IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Trial Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is investigated against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the takeover of Unipol.
During the trial against him last week, his release from house arrest was transformed into a duty of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to move from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such remittances (against which the prosecutor ’ s office had pronounced itself) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to reach him with evidence.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was already revealed a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House ’ s $700 billion austerity package: a large part of the Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday ’ s edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis is dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly dividing itself into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those neo-conservatives who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and who, in particular, win voters in the south and at the heart of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise mainly to the voice of what I mentioned above.
This example is, however, only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the US, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond it will be affected.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events, which finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties with foreign countries and at the same time manage a vast amount of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: how to behave towards the families concerned, which also represent an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been disconnected and lost its right to speak: the EU has given clear proof of this, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects their own state to intervene; rescue plans, new rules, and, most importantly, distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became ever more serious, only the US has to save itself in the economic situation without foreign aid.
And in addition to the means they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two conditions that cannot be overvalued - under certain circumstances - which otherwise probably no international organisation and no market will be able to resort to in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the national element of the state is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that is recently associated with a closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered into a networked whole empire, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we have to realize at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, but are nevertheless extremely connected to a strictly circumscribed piece of earth - a territory.
Therefore, the one who possesses such a territory is advantageous to another who lives in an area without harvest, without water or free from oil.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, presupposes a brief insertion.
Who says territory, who government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaders, especially those of the economy, which turned out to be insufficient and full of shadows.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, still worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, intolerance, an image of inexpediency, a sense of distance, all aimed at a whole class of Western leaders.
In this way, the conviction among large parts of the population seems to pave the way, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content represents itself to the majority as increasingly foreign and more traditional.
The demand for leadership thus nourishes underground a branched but powerful movement of disempowerment of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the unmediated upswing of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of American deputies against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectuals, creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West, and which is being intensified and driven by the financial crisis to the point of over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached its destination.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 sqm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon and nanotubes.
Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta explains, "The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of spaghetti arranged tubes."
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass teflon and grinding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the reptile feet and at the same time "easily removed from the wall", according to Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
TO MAUERN DANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a transient adhesive", Liming Dai adds.
For example, how Spiderman goes up on walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could be space travel.
So the superheroes have to wait for the moment.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH - also the University of Berkeley, California, dedicates itself to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibres that clean itself from dust like hair by moving on a surface and thus always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never use fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin wealth, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medications, since they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices in conjunction with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again raised the alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN GEFAHR - The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago against the dangers of this mix, and stressed to pay attention to what is drunk in conjunction with means such as diazepan or metadone.
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano, said: "Such results are usually immediately passed on to the various international manufacturers who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, to have no fear of having a pharmacist or physician to ask, "emphasizes the expert of the ANSA agency.
Nobel Economic Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economic Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neo-keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush Administration ’ s greatest critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in an editorial of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that received little polemics as an answer and that was maintained years later by the economist, but now proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The date of release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both freelance and public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft Office.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now Spartan designed start menu, now finally a completely guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is reached, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also on compatibility with Microsoft ’ s Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
In this way, "hybrid" pdf files can be generated which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe formats by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by several users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, a frabe is assigned to each processor in order to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which is located since Friday on the mirrors.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if freedom of cost can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also particularly in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed the big throw: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training offers, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at displacing Excel; Impress, for creating presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the better known Access; and last Draw, a graphics module.
The objective for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads - a target that can be slightly exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also Kohl tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case with the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, the third classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by L'Equipe on their website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who was positively tested for Cera, the third generation Epo. Prior to this, Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli from Italy and Stefan Schumacher from Germany had already achieved this.
The analyses from the blood samples of coal are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay laboratories.
If the other samples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Anti-doping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest and, according to the Associated Press, notify the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME INVITATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with reluctance.
Is this a nation of racists from Belpaese? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the theme of racism in Italy and based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, born in Burkina Faso, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls "the paradox of the north": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrant sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only that.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which the Pope and the President of the Republic also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 Euro per room high rental prices
The market for housing for students knows no crises.
According to the latest survey by the union of tenants, Sunia, a single room can cost students up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits. Whole crowds of students are thus effectively losing their right to study, as their families are unable to support them at this level" - said Laura Mariani, the head of the Sunia - "in these cities the great demand on the part of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rentals include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rentals.
For the Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices through a revision of taxation.
On closer inspection of the investigation it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the district Brianza is needed approx. 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the quarter Bande Nere) and ends at 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the quarter Vittoria.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350 / 400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students are concentrated in the neighborhoods around the university, 250 / 280 euros are for a sleeping space of necessities, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the neighbourhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300 Euro 450 for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 Euro in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250 Euro, a single room costs at least 350 Euro.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25% to 30% above average are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema - the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long run death for the one-room cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the traits of a cultural crime.
The film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who 20 years ago brought him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the vast amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these mines paid for most of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are multiplex cinemas, because they are precisely these three regions in which the largest number of modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy lists the lists, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia and Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all the preservation of the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are ready to visit instead of the old a multiplex cinema in the periphery.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association external eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to approx. 10 million euro.
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between EUR 16 and 18 million a year would be needed ".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to have decided to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec because of the fears surrounding the old cinemas; it is the first such agreement in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the foreseen measures are tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as advantages for the public in terms of public transport: it will be permitted to drive into the traffic licensed areas of the center and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a good initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore. "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside in order not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the Antimafia District Authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia affairs, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, then to a compensation of 10 million euros.
"Any kind of moral and legal norm disregarding", the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"Thus it was made possible for the mafia group - according to the judges - to penetrate into the town halls by official means and to co-determine the politics of the public administration."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organized crime." There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest. "
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration - the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, was elected head of the Mitterechts coalition after the May 2006 run-off.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He then referred to Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political strategic reasons. However, in connection with this morning ’ s arrest warrant, the judges declare that the Piromalli and Clan had even dared to apply for a change to the A3.
From an interception in connection with the investigations on the Dal Torrione case, the willingness has been shown to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - whereby the measures of the public administration became identical with the interests of this clan.

When the energy springs from the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a never-ending source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet ’ s surface, and only now does it seem to understand the world ’ s major energy companies.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking for, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; not accidentally, these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed in 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now environmental organisations and the rise in oil prices are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world ’ s energy demand could be met by ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power stations.
In addition, there are the currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract to build a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now focusing on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies," according to the spokesman of a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the possibility of working with us. "
This is about obtaining an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being extracted by the US, especially in Alaska, and that President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
Besides Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are not known, as observers talk about an increasing interest.
Technologies that are yet to be improved.
Experts are talking about technology that is still in progress, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipes.
Until now, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for the state approval. Part of the energy gained could also be used for military installations.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a shopping cottage and a park set using undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorization to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Recovery Research, a particular interest immediately deserves the potential that lies in tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more trustworthy power source.
Tidal energy in particular is what led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to already invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
