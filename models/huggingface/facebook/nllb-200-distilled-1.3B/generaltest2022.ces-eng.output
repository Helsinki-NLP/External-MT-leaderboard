The big comeback of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a rough patch in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be in the starting lineup and could soon be in the goal.
The former goalie of Lithuvínov, Plzeň and Chelyabinsk, Russia, was injured in training for the NHL in October of this year.
He was replaced midway through the game with Vegas, and he hasn't played on the NHL ice since.
The incident occurred as the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel French will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury", Denver officials announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended for over two months.
On Sunday morning, US time, he was called from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He's got 94.5% of the AHL's interventions.
The veteran of the Pilsen hockey team wants to finally prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had a hip problem his senior year and didn't catch a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, he's caught 36 games for the franchise, and his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles putting on Camille's Christmas veil, William and Kate posing in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas wishes this year.
Prince Charles also shared his wishes, using a photograph of his wife Camille helping to put on a headscarf at the races.
The British news channel BBC reported on its website.
They send greetings to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte is wearing a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt, just like Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate have not said, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas photo in front of a pile of wood in their country mansion in Norfolk.
A picture to serve as a Christmas greeting was also shared by Crown Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot Racecourse in June.
Charles, wearing a top hat and a veil over his face, helps Camille to put on her colorfully matched veil with a light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbrou a million for the title, which Tvrdík denied.
Prague  Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr was supposed to get from Prague Slavie a million crowns promised for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He reported it to the efotbal.cz server, saying he had access to some police files.
The chairman of the board of the mountain club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that the red and white did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps featuring Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential Red and White official was in frequent contact with both Berber and former sports director of the then second-tier Vysehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Forensics reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbra had promised a financial reward for obtaining the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Prague won the first league title.
The police had knowledge that Roman (Berber) was to receive a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
The day after, according to the forensics, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors Slavie Tvrdiek.
The file doesn't say if the police are still processing this information.
The claim denies any corrupt practices.
In the years 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal act, tried to influence the referees in violation of fair play rules and have not provided any financial benefits to anyone in this regard", the claim for the List of Reports stated.
In the episodes, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players of dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations, including the FAČR's Prague headquarters.
The highest-ranking player in the affair is Berber, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad.
Helicopters, tanks and Bvp are larping the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but essentially of a worse type (the gunners must be from the armored cabin and carry the shells by hand without a cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus the Prague V3S has already been eliminated by the specialised units.
Airplanes: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and small types without combat potential
We don't have any missiles, but we do manufacture and export them.
PVO: medium - cold-war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I'm in a chase right outside the city.
Otters were coming up the river and they were damaging the crops, so I was sitting there.
And as I came, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sat there and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came up, but of course, the fox went away.
I let her come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his forehead all over the place, so I called him and said it was a fox.
He was gone by the time I got off the property.
I mean, even a meadow can be a Prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences to make something happen, you'd probably be seeing in the thermal imaging that almost everyone has today.
So, in plain sight, expensive stuff, put it in the sleeping bag and you should be fine.
The Prince versus the Hammer.
The inmates got respirators substantially cheaper than the health department .
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of dollars on their purchase in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of the various ministries and found that in a single day the cost of a respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities were economical?
And why did others buy the railroad?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking with the editor of the iRohzlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and armies (I'm not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that older generations have had), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from a compulsory war.
We don't even have a big stockpile of equipment that the trained can handle, we don't even have the modern technology for the existing professionals, and the modern technology is getting more and more complex, so the ability of the quarterbacks will quickly wear off over time.
And modern conventional conflicts, wherever they can be deployed, will be very fast, there will be no time to rehearse anyone.
And finally, the back-up/territorial defense is of great importance for countries like Ukraine where you go to fight mass guerrilla warfare and it's a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
The only way to fight in the Czech Republic is to fight a conflict of such magnitude and intensity that the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we don't have the geography to do it.
We don't have any individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them act like they have it.
Then you get into a situation where you look at a guy who missed a free throw two minutes ago, and he's driving alone into the field with two or even three Swiss, and you're like, "Wow, what do you think's gonna happen now?"
Well, of course they'll take him as the average taxpayer.
This whole "get the defender" thing is so bad, I find myself honestly surprised to see our striker get one of the other players.
The first swallows
The COVID pandemic is slowing down, but experts don't expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
The hospital surge is expected to last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course than vaccination or post-infective immunity from previous disease helps to prevent.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon has also entered the COVID equation on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, reducing the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and being treated at home.
And soon it will be joined by Pfizer's paxlovid, which has been reported to be as effective as 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for the incoming drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company was also the first to land on the map because the drug had been in development long before the current pandemic to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their views openly.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying, "how did our beak grow?"
You know, you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people would say no.
In the West, they tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks good in the polls, good in the west, bad in the east.
But it's really going to find out what people are thinking.
In France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both over 20 percent, according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of the units so that the soldiers don't have to relearn where what is, so all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum of the Hill, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the USSR didn't want to have a nuclear warhead on its territory either for safety reasons or for the speed of deployment of the warheads because of its western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree) only warheads were kept, not whole missiles as they say.
If the weapon needed to be deployed, a special unit would come and pick up the warhead and mount it on a portable device.
Apart from the museum maple, the rest are in a dilapidated state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was often too much of a show-off, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he was a regular walker, he was a regular walker, he was a regular walker, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was clean.
He went to school in the country, did all kinds of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never in trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, my siblings, the gypsies, joined the same class, different classes.
Shortly after, they beat up the teacher, often had police dealings, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sell something occasionally for advertising (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to trick me into the price, communication was calm.
I even sold my car like this, and a guy called a month later and said he'd already signed it over.
I tell myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or whatever, as long as they behave as they belong in a decent society (work, work, don't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But if someone comes in, reaches out, cleans apartments and houses, makes a mess, makes trouble... it doesn't matter what color it is, but I'm gonna care.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they get involved, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be there for them.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachaticku.
"The young woman suffered multiple serious injuries and despite resuscitative care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene", said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokeswoman for the South Bohemian Medical Rescue.
The driver who drove the girl was probably responsible for the accident.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot was driving in the direction of Žíchovec towards Bavorov and, for reasons that have not yet been established, he went off the curve in the opposite direction.
After a collision with a Skoda Octavia, a Peugeot ended up on a roof outside the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová said.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and he was trapped in the car.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in Český Budějovick in a stable condition, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from outside the EU, often withheld from customers
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mostly a collector of cards.
It can usually be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free, the collector approaches.
Since October, he has been charged a slightly higher price for ordering small consignments, and now he has to add VAT and submit data to customs.
He gets an e-mail saying the customs are expecting the package.
Then, fill in the details of the consignment and, if the trader has not already included VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the consignment and transport.
Where the addressee does not undertake the customs procedure himself, the fee to the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
But according to Lukas Neuheisel, the whole process isn't complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, I put in two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
New customs regulations have reduced the daily number of international mailings received at the international post office in Prague from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide data needed to complete customs procedures.
There are currently 30,000 shipments in the international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information they needed, and they did it on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you propose to address current inflation?
We're currently at 9.9% inflation and expect it to continue to rise.
What do you think the state should do to slow or offset this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, so I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford the basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get for a raise?
I've been given a 2% gross increase this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately, I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would someone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are sent to prison for only six months?
I just can't believe a court can send an animal like that away for six months just to do it again the minute he gets out.
Six months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention, the rape victim may never recover.
Wouldn't that discourage potential future rape victims from reporting?
The man from the grave burned his costumed girlfriend
The Tomb Man unwittingly helped the officers secure his nationally wanted Kostomlat girlfriend, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
He himself called them to her.
He went around the bend.
First he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after the 911 call and were not surprised when the alleged thief told them that he had made up the whole thing to get the officers to arrive.
In fact, he was just trying to advise the officers on how to report the crime to the Czech Police.
Then, when the officers were checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, they discovered that the woman was on a nationwide wanted list and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore being handled by the CPVO.
A question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally think we're not ethnically or culturally Slavic anymore, but I'd like to know what you think.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, of course, it's a shame Churchill couldn't secure the liberation of Prague from the USA:')
Of course, I'm not denying that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially be beneficial.
I personally would not consider that a true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, of something like ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say it's quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will severely punish you if you believe in another god.
Yet, in the tenth, it says that there is no god but Jehovah.
Would it not be more rational, then, to abstain from belief in any god at all than to risk making the wrong choice among the thousands of gods and being sent to hell or some other place for doing so by the one true God whom I have just missed?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent placement in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I guess.
X months of training (in different specialisations, X months in one) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
Any ACR unit could use something like this.
It could be done in partnership with the Defense University.
We can say this: there is a constant failure of cooperation between education and industry, there is a business hunt in schools and there is a kind of intermingling, where the workforce migrates from education to employment.
Not only as we grow up, but this process is constant, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one discipline to another, and so on.
A similar interlinkage should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or even Mongol invader will ever come here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is a stone carved thing, we have allies and they will defend us if something goes wrong.
Well, enjoy yourself, pal.
All it takes is one election in the US to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The British will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas and the Poles have shown once before that you can turn your back and take what you want.
The only thing that can guarantee independence in the long run is a heavily armed army and a population that can master the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot a remote control device, so what the hell.
We don't need border fortifications, which sucks nowadays, but a cranky teenager on a remote control can handle it.
How to Avoid Drowning in a Box Tsunami
You unwrap presents under a Christmas tree and suddenly you're home packed with boxes and stuffing?
This waste is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
So we've created a map of the stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillers to the participating shop (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
This will encourage small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging that is currently in short supply and also the money saved, as packaging cardboard has risen by 50% in recent years.
I'm also strengthening my brand in the eyes of environmentally conscious consumers.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-pharmacy and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are delivered to Popovek near Brno by individuals who stockpile them at home, but we also receive calls from companies with whom we have arranged regular shipments of cartons.
We'll use it to pack the shipments from our e-shop.
Through individuals and businesses, we work together to create a more compassionate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz does not only show the pick-up points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to dispose of anything (where to take your household trash, where to return expired medicines, tires, used electricity, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All the waste can be put back where it belongs, and recycled stuff can find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
It is gradually adding collection yards, reuse centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find uses for things that would otherwise become waste, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the Clean Up the Czech Republic app.
I think it's more of a bad thing that technology is so simple and foolproof these days that kids who use computers and phones play games on them, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple's photo apps or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying file system with the folders and put it all on one screen in the app.
They can use the technology from childhood, but they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency over the weekend  starting in January  and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, unveiling the presidency logo, calling for the protection of Europeans  at work, on the street  and mentioning so many events that they will be impossible to catch up in six months.
But French politicians like it, and the voters like it.
Macron's supporters of the split between right and left will agree on a few things, but especially in Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "a history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
Many commentators immediately rushed to criticize Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they're trying to prevent history from being rewritten.
The far-right candidate for president of France, Eric Zemmour, is currently running around France arguing that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler in World War II, was not so bad, and is having quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries are learning history more as a story of us versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs, they'll find out who beat who in what battle.
But unless they have an enlightened cantor, they no longer know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won the awards for directing and best actress Jasna Duričić.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he held the top spot in the audience rankings.
Anthony Hopkins won best actor in Berlin for his film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "getting the flu/being high" for a couple of days.
It was worse than the flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Just personal experience. I'm not saying everyone does.)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on December 20, will feature a traditional literary appendix.
And with it, cultural tips.
We're adding these books to this digital edition, so you have plenty of time to buy them as Christmas gifts.
Prozaic texts that follow on from the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another dose of world-observation and description of everyday things with unusual poetic attention, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer Šesták tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
A story of a return to the roots that turns out to be a longed-for illusion.
A bohemian and a comparator brings the tale of the Red Soup to the backdrop of a modern village.
Its brutality transcends popular versions and graduates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the road back to instinct is shorter than a man is willing to admit.
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a far less sentimental story of emigration than we're used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to put it into a life together.
Trains start running on new timetables, somewhere the hauliers change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway under the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet starts to run instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time and, if necessary, the route are slightly modified.
Dozens of new trains will also be on the tracks.
The airlines started selling tickets in the autumn.
The Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger services per day on the new timetable, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains per day.
The trains will travel some 118 million kilometres during the new schedule.
In addition to the national routes, the new timetable will also cover Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will be rolling out dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main innovation will be InterJet trains that will run on the Prague-Cheb lines.
The carrier will also operate new trains in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares each year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry on the R23 line Ústí nad Labem  Mělník  Nymburk  Köln.
The carrier will replace České dráhy after successfully competing in the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 daily services on the route, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance services between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesman, Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned cutoff work, the carrier tried to maintain the most similar running times of its long-distance trains.
Trains operated by Arriva and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional routes.
Changes are awaiting passengers, for example in Česko-Lipovo, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run instead of the Czech Railways on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use the single railway ticket in the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by inflationary 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's point of view?
We hear everywhere how hard they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, died.
I've never heard of a lecture from the slave party's perspective in my life or since, no one defends it, only condemns it.
No one even tells you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaveholders.
No one teaches you in school that colonists often bought land from Indians, but they tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while they killed each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in the North and the South.
I have not seen anyone intentionally withholding the facts, but I have heard this happen before and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the facts of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
Speaking of the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaveholders are quite popular there, but they had some good things to do, too, and I thought it absurd to dismiss them.
Besides, the North wasn't much better than many people idealize it to be these days.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner and they hated a lot of things too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and they don't even have our perspective (YT even had a video of a TV where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about the American schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought that some of the universities were pretty shocking, that these students were pretty radicalized, and the schools supported them a lot.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I get a little sick of this being the majority vote, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
I think maybe feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to do and it's not the same anymore, it's radicalised.
Today, feminists are defined as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore a basic biological fact, as do other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation on the other side, often leading to resistance to even reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more they're heard.
Anyway, in the end, I didn't meet anyone who judged me for colonialism or slavery.
I was more of a geography freak, but it was a two-way street.
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do by myself?
Moreover, I find the concept of nationality in general to be useless in terms of any personal identity.
If there's anything that connects me to people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always screws up some coronavirus bullshit that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there's the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they're Protestants, but they're actually born of Catholic modernism and they're actually Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to Hussite services because it's very similar theologically, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
The church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square is a Dominican church, and even Sundays at 3 p.m., there is a Latin Mass, as before Vatican II.
The Flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria.
Breslau  The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts didn't go to Vienna to pick him up because of the coronavirus pandemic, but this time they picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal  Breslau border crossing.
They took him over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem lights are a beautiful Christmas tradition that my band and I attend every year, and I look forward to it.
"It is an honor to be chosen", said Scout Amália Budikova to the press.
Whereas last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal  Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually, the scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes when it comes to the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the light of Bethlehem by train first to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The lighting will be provided by Scout couriers on Saturday, December 18th, traveling in select express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the lighting at the stations, which will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic and where the railways do not lead.
Again this year, the Scouts must follow current measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We recommend that both the courier teams and the organizers of local events wear masks, try to keep the spacing as small as possible, not sing to colleagues, just behave in a way that is as safe as possible, said Bethlehem Light event spokeswoman Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, the scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is supported by hundreds of volunteers, making the flame a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics background, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education, all of that money is being put to good use, but I don't understand why that money is being put into agriculture, industry and businesses in general.
As mentioned, it produces a wasteful product, and it crashes the free market and the "natural life of the firm".
I work in a factory where there are a million signs of Xy in the hallways funded/co-funded by Project Xy and this kind of company is just kept alive artificially.
This is not supporting a company that gives jobs to X people, this is a development block where this company just hangs around and takes contracts/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's gone.
I totally agree, it's terrible.
Even those born in the Internet age will occasionally fall prey to tricks or traps - especially advertising.
I think I'm not getting the internet ads, but then I realize that they've got me too - it's just so out of control that you can't always resist.
I therefore support the radical voices in the European Parliament who are currently calling for a total ban on programmatic advertising...
It's all bullshit, in the classic words - I would ban the Internet.
I have a feeling this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
"I will not believe in anything that the majority believes makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I prefer to believe in something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about it that I will claim is critical thinking".
"I'm not going to believe everything the media says".

TV has fallen out of the trend of Christmas movies, with 200 releasing this year.
Los Angeles  Movies, TV stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen behind the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will show a record-breaking 200 more.
It was calculated by the IMDb movie database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been gaining popularity in recent years, and the number of such films is increasing.
Four times as many Christmas movies were made this year as in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb only included the movies that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be a lot more holiday movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period, and worldwide popular films are also popular, such as Alone at Home, Love in Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom in Christmas movies didn't start until 2009, when the Hallmark cable television special was released, the BBC said.
Her advent project, Countdown to Christmas, was a four-film project and was a huge success.
This year, the channel began tuning in on October 22 for its Christmas programming, and will present a total of 42 Christmas movies.
Competing Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter so much, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing", described the genre in exaggeration Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours amidst all the holiday craziness and the world craziness we've been living in for the past few years", Gray added.
He said, for example, that Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end, some misunderstanding arises, which is resolved, and they kiss.
This is how it goes over and over again, and as long as all the films look and feel the same, people watch one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19, will not be involved in the final race of F1.
Only 19 drivers will enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not be competing until the final race of the season.
Haas's stable will only send one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he was supposed to attack for a better place from the 20th place he had taken in qualifying.
But the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not interfere in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for COVID-19.
With only 19 cars on the grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the front Max Verstappen, will take the lead in the final lap to face Lewis Hamilton in a head-to-head title battle.
Mazepin is described by the Haas stable as being in relatively good health and showing no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved", her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas won't send a reserve driver to the race, and they can't.
A potential substitute would have to qualify or ride at a different part of the weekend.
COVID-19 is not a first-time competitor.
Kimi Räikkönen was COVID-19 at the start of the season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You could go to jail for this, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds, the price tag of the most expensive sweater will blow your mind!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and the designer put in six months of work and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, my home never wore a sweater", admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
The silk was bought in Italy, the 24-karat gold thread in France and 2,000 ornamental crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
The women, the explorers and the drone pilots could be on the ground before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They're supposed to help their Polish colleagues with the border security with Belarus and the planned fence construction.
Poland has formally requested assistance from NATO countries in the wake of months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens from Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already in Poland.
Omikron mutation spreading to the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is looking into another case of the Adam's baby.
We've actually got another suspected variant in another Adamov kid, from prep school.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov School of Medicine has not been proven, said Ciupek.
Six cases have been reported in the county in the last week.
We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases  It is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Health in Prague, said the Director.
She added that the two nurses were from the same workplace at the Brno University Hospital and the two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old students of ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the Brno case and Adam's.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four are asymptomatic.
No one with Omikron suspicion has traveled abroad.
None of the individuals mentioned had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had they come into contact with anyone who was abroad.
The connection to the water polo championship is not in any of the above, Ciupek said.
The head hygienist Pavla Svrčinová said earlier that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, was being investigated.
There were players from South Africa on board and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California is restricting the sale of guns.
He wants to do what Texas does with abortion bans.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans Saturday to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state, using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after an embryo's heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement followed a Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld Texas' abortion ban, even as it went against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established abortion rights nationwide for about 24 months of pregnancy.
The Court of First Instance did not, however, now rule on the constitutionality of the whole Act, but on a technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was made public in this case, thus preventing the Texas Republicans from challenging it through the usual judicial process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas's maneuver to protect its law", the California governor said.
"If now states can block federal review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect human lives", Newsom continues.
He has reportedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures that would empower public officials to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is a term for homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to evade regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 in damages and legal fees from anyone in California who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost weapon" parts, or kits for their manufacture.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private prosecutions, then that's exactly what we should do", the California governor said.
California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to reinstate the ban using the Texas model, it would confirm the words of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue selected perpetrators in the southern state.
Every emergency vaccine has its public testing phase, where the vaccine schedule is gradually figured out and the vaccines themselves are also improved based on the results.
There are already large studies in Israel on the effects of four doses.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it will have its own schedule over time, just too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus is expected to be on the market soon, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times greater efficacy.

Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobr, the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers and stopped the disbursement of money to Poland because of a rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of a Polish plan to draw up a €36 billion EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail by vetoing all matters requiring unanimity", said Ziobro, the head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policies, which are leading to drastic increases in energy prices, added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland cease its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified, given that the EU is unlawfully withholding funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
The European Commission believes that the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobr's tenure are threatening its independence and subordinating it to politicians.
According to Ziobr, Brussels is imposing "impossible conditions" because its aim is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland.
Warsaw is facing "political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles", Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept concessions from Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony", he said.
But to be honest, at my place in Lidl, they have the same kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for anything else, I ran into this yogurt a few times, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, and after ten minutes on the dairy rack, I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector, all the select, less-common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and the lactose-free zone...
If there's a dodge, I'm not going to any more supermarkets, action, no action, the gold store in the square, they may not have that choice, but they usually have everything I need and they have some sort of order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I'm going to Lidl to take a vacation.

I was punished with a stove as a child.
It was never about grades, mostly just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was mean (she read instead of going to bed, argued with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, with my mother always threatening to hit me if I did it again (sometimes even after another "grab", she would just bring the stew and put it down for me to see).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few blows on my ass (over my clothes).
I personally believe that physical punishment (when reasonably applied and in moderation) is beneficial because it is more effective than words.
I think the warning part is important because it kind of gives the child a choice of either disobeying and getting it or getting better and not getting punished.
In the end, I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
Defence of the system
When prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl was asked in 1999 what the Czech Constitution meant to him - a sacred document on which he swore and which he learned in school from an early age or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he decided to go for the former.
We once agreed in the Constitution on democratic rules for our lives that define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes, it's better to save.
And think about it: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as the Czechs like pork and cabbage dumplings, Vojtěch Cepl voted on the question.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
The flight is tested by situations that its creators (among whom Vojtěch Cepl was) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about these documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, and only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of governmental order consisting of individual rules that set the game for politicians.
We're afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie politicians to bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid is not choosing, FN Brno is fighting for the life of a few months old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with, especially recently.
We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults, Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and Masaryk University Medical School, told Novinka.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often asymptomatic.
However, there are children's patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in recent times", added Dominik.
The doctor says there are dozens of children in need of moderate supportive care.
It's set at the infant infectious disease clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with the coronavirus are only recently at the ARU.
The children with post-covid syndromes were in the ward continuously for the entire year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, that is, pneumonia requiring a resuscitation bed", he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and babies of several months old in addition to adults.
There are also children in hospitals who are in a critical condition due to the coronavirus.
"We are currently seeing a child, a few months old and a teenager", said the headmaster.
She is, however, happy that the FN Brno Children's Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths from coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital  not only in the coronavirus ward  is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
It also highlights the fact that, as in adults and children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"We therefore recommend the use of the vaccine dose in children", the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They're on a tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the field).
Skiing/biking in the forest off the marked path is not allowed unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
The music is in my head, Josef Kurfirt laughs.
He's a fan of the Liberace opera and originally played the forest horn.
As a singer he can sing virtually all repertoire and as a conductor he performs not only in the Liberec Theatre of F. Šalda, but also in Pilsen, in the Theater of Josef Kajetan Tyla.
He collaborates with the Prague Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression that the disease is under control and that the authoritarian regime is better at dealing with the crisis
Sinolog Jiroush: China is building the impression that the disease is under control and that the authoritarian regime is better at dealing with the crisis.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing faced criticism for failing to stop a disease that has become a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increase in infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in many places to fight the coronavirus, including the worst-hit Italy.
How do we see Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and says, "Hey, you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
Wife likes him because he mows the lawn, he washes the car with a mop, the kids play with him.
Oh, that's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: Let's clap, this is gonna be great...
After a while they meet and the buyer complains: "You man, what did you sell it for????
The lawn's cracked, there's huge shit everywhere, the car's broken down, the kids are scared of him, and the wife wants a divorce.
The seller says, "You talk badly about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that"...
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
While sovereign nations are equal, they are the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works towards its integration.
It is still functioning at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
I personally think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe by mid-century, the mood will be different and we'll get there.
I thought so, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'll just spell it out.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually includes two different units on the same plane.
I'll borrow an example from another commentary on Spanish oranges and mandarins, where it's clear that they're both from Spain, whereas Spanish fruit and mandarins are not so clear that they're from Spain.
Furthermore, I base this on the fact that the sentence applies to all US forces, including their weapons, and that I know that US facilities are operated only by Americans.
So in other words, I expect that this is already covered in the broad term and there is no need to specify it further for the US forces.
But again, maybe just a wordsmith:
Either way, it's a pointless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the cosmonaut monkey Milly
The chilling footage shows a frightened monkey curling up in a toilet bowl before its callous owner flushes it out and laughs at it.
The Dutch monkey also fed hot dogs, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from raising animals for life, reports The Sun.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen an alien so terrified.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehab at Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week suspended sentence of one year's imprisonment at the Gwent Magistrates Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from raising animals for life, and ordered to pay court costs of 12 000 crowns.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue".
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She would crouch and hide from anyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement would make her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, after she's settled in and is content with the male, the sight of new humans can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will stay with her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's harassment came to light after Gwent police discovered horrific footage on her wife's phone after a raid on her apartment over drug charges.
The footage shows Milly using vulgar language.
In the next video, you can hear the Dutch monkey offering cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
£1,600 worth of cocaine was found in her home hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given 20 months' probation.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that ancient age three times in a row as you boldly leap across the entire 20th century?

I'm a big fan of the big picture, and the fact is, people don't want or need it.
And in that moment, it's useless and you'll never get it in anyway.
Part of it is learning for the many people who are going to need that thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need all this stuff to stand by the machine, I meant it very seriously... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the point where not knowing is the mark of punk.

The marriage at first sight, the war of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away", Andrea responded to the questions of curious fans on Instagram in Stories, which disappointed her so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Kadri and Andrea have been at odds since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she was adamantly against it.
And as you can see, not only did their relationship not end in love, but it grew from disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! He was upset by Kadri's turn in response to Andre's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's supposed honesty, now that his ex-wife was gone, did not sit well with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally comment on these things, and even in my family, we never said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly insult and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't stand it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
I'm even more sorry to read such false information that's probably taken out of context.
I wish everyone knew Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrey's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what's written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and we know the truth and we know what it was like, she added vaguely.
A drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You're not gonna believe what I did.
Chao started his robbery on a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than climbing up to the fifth floor and going through an open window into the apartment.
He stole two bananas there.
A security camera then caught him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and he called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day of the charge.
And since he needed the money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and in effect is tied to pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Isn't that enough of a reason?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
In the Saturday municipal elections, more than 60 percent of the voters turned out.
New representatives were elected on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Libereck and Rovna in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has been reduced below the number established by law or the elected representatives have disbanded.
A total of 99 candidates were in the running for 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
The results of Saturday's election symbolically close a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to the municipal representatives and especially the closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place, said vice-president of the CSU Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding on equipment and staff security.
The election was won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member House of Representatives.
STAN's candidate won 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means she's gained two seats.
Two seats in the Chamber of Deputies were won by Citizens for the Commune, with 18.52% of voters casting their ballots.
The former mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromní, was elected again.
One seat in the Chamber of Deputies was won by Comenians  independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters turned out.
In the village of Rovná on Pelhřimovsk won the association for Rovná.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Independent Candidates Association 1 and one from the Independent Candidates Association 2 have been elected to the municipal council.
The turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lužica on Mostecku were again won by the Association of Lužice and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member assembly.
The second place went to the candidate of the People's Assembly, which received 43.27 percent of the votes, so she will have three representatives in the House of Representatives.
Voter turnout was 76.7 percent.
The election in Nová Vesla in Liberec was won by the independent candidates Hope for New Village ahead of the YES Movement.
The Independent candidates' association won 59.88 percent of the vote, winning four seats in the seven-member city council.
Yes won 40.12 percent of the vote and against a fair election in 2018 it strengthened, gaining three more seats.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the Code of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all about what people write here.
You're just playing dumb to get someone to "quibble" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic standpoint (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, I'm concerned about how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raised, suppressing science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-old
You may believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together.
The man fell headlong from a height of 40 feet.
He survived the impact.
A man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall on Sunday night, when he was rescued by the Regional Medical Emergency Service.
Around midnight Saturday, the regional operations center received a distress call with initial reports of a man falling from a height.
Two ZZS medical and medical crews immediately arrived at the scene.
When the paramedics arrived, they discovered that a 27-year-old man had fallen from a window about 40 feet [12 m] and hit the concrete head-on!
Coal is stuck in the Vítkovic.
But not the way it should be, and the fire department went into action.
When the emergency services arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The doctor injected him with a breathing tube, provided artificial respiration and, after further measures in the pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava Traumatology Center, said Lukáš Humpl, spokesman for the Regional Health Service.
I'm more worried about the inadequate response from the public and the authorities than the coronavirus.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the frontline of the fight against the infection is primarily doctors and healthcare staff.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We're asking the army doctor, David the Butcher.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala night full of interesting results.
Because things were happening at UFC 269.
Outfielder Julianna Pena has defeated legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who has not found a matchmaker in seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight division did not hesitate, he showed a great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a victory, quickly knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
He also beat his opponent Sean O'Malley.
A surprise no one expected.
That's what the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena brought.
The American entered the battle as a fictional dwarf, as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was, moreover, in the spirit of paper presuppositions.
Nunes started the race very aggressively and even gave her opponent a push kick that knocked her to the ground.
But Penny was not forced to make any more mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack herself with a lever in her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents were honored with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
And the penny also got Nunes to the ground, where she started strangling her.
She must have given up and knocked off the attack.
The American woman has shocked everyone by becoming the new champion.
The highlight of the gala night was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the cards began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active, Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on the arm.
He didn't do very well, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, hit his opponent on the back and gave him a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third lap, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to unlock the strangulation.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost two years later.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed a sovereign victory, using a hard right rear on Raulian Pava in the first round.
He then beat him with a series of precision-guided blows and scored his 15th victory.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrand.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, now she lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and so there is no problem in determining whether they are masculine, feminine, or middle.
There is also a fairly large group of nouns for which the genus is not established.
Nouns like that fluctuate between the two houses.
When tilted, they then become double-edged and in some cases remain untilted.
For example, the words svisel or kyčel are masculine and feminine, in the former they are pronounced according to the pattern maschine, in the latter according to the pattern written.
For another group of nouns, the forms are different even in the first case of the single number, for example: order/order, kedluben/kedlubna or pambor/potato (in the sense of food).
The two forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example okurka in the Czech Republic and okurek in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, as are other Czech-Moravian word pairs: příkop and příkopa, kobliha and koblih, etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were initially unpronounceable, but gradually they have taken on Czech endings.
A typical example is the word image, which is both masculine and feminine, or the word bufet, which remained unpronounced in the middle gender but has endings in the masculine pattern hrad.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation on the Greek border?
Tensions are high at the Greek-Turkish border over the rising number of migrants trying to cross into Europe.
Thousands of people have started heading to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are pledging support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to make the uncertain journey?
And what's the situation like on the ground?
"We hadn't seen the blue sky in three months and were choking", says a Sydney reporter
Australia's devastating fires, now in their fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of acres of land.
How are the authorities and the people coping?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects that critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the face of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking with Sydney reporter Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone's always in the papers.
People are uncomfortable with the way sexual violence is in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to make it a problem.
I don't know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I've seen how these people are often treated by their neighbors or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
It's become a trend that victims are finally opening up about their trauma.
Too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who make false accusations.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping the sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is flooded with houses, families can't afford to finish
The price of building materials has risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got in trouble for that.
She has no funds to complete the single-family homes and banks refuse to increase her mortgage.
In addition to material prices, the cost of construction works is also increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete single-family homes that have already been built.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
At best, people move into unfurnished, unfurnished homes.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage and rent", says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three single-family houses a year, and 50 percent of them are done.
For us as a construction company, it's hard to keep things in the contract even when the material is priced higher.
So we work without earnings", said Zdeněk Slivoň, owner of a construction company.
A lot of people are gonna have financial problems.
If they were counting on the house costing five million to build, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait", added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction companies also struggle with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic is lacking in graduates in construction and the influx of foreign workers is being slowed by the pandemic.
The only situation which is more favourable at the moment is the situation regarding the granting of building permits.
The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, almost 10 percent more than a year ago, said Křeček.
We're having a good time, and we're gonna have a better time.
But the real vision is missing, says commentator CRO  my Voice
The traditional celebrations of the new year have been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and ANO President Andrei Babis and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What crucial information have we learned?
I'm a graduate student, I have my own subject, I'm a graduate student, I always do it all year, and then in a week or two I write the written part.
The state's women are perfectly cool with us, unless you're a total monkey and you've got something in your head, then this committee won't suffocate you on theory for nothing.
I was in law school for a week, and when I was at the end of my days, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical conclusion that I could see right away and I was right.
And other than those projects, I know people who pay someone to do a semester project for them -- we've done it a lot of times, really rewarding, they learn a lot -- and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great to have an exam at the end of the class that reflects the knowledge you've gained from the project, not just the defense.
It's all right, but don't listen to e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pooh Bear.
You should put it in a way that he can touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks at artists.
Once you don't put out stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach drops to the absolute minimum.
Plus, it's always changing which feature is more important, like, comment or save.
It's been really bugging me lately, so I might have to reduce myself to a tick-tock, where a lot of artists in my field are successful and they hardly let it happen.
And finally, I might even like to see something that's more user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Declaration by the Donbass Workers' Party
Union  yes, broken  no, opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in this picture.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
In the Belovsk Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the openly lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.
With one stroke of the pen, they destroyed a vast country of almost 300 million people.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, tens of millions of ethnic Russians found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Even with the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed in one sitting in the Beloveg Forest what had been built in the previous 70 years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialized, they curbed agriculture, they cut off the world's greatest power from 14 republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we look even deeper, we see the depletion of population, the collapse of the economy, the science, the military, the rise of crime, the inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO eastward, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria -- all the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There's a term in political science called a power vacuum.
Everything that was hastily betrayed and abandoned was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980's and early 1990's.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs $1.50 a pound.
I'm gonna buy it, but I'm gonna put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to $0.99/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which this meat changes its price to become a burden on my digestive system?
Or I wait until Thursday and the meat is going to be discounted to $50/kg the day before the expiration date - how would this be different from the meat I bought on Monday for $200 a pound and left in my fridge for three days?
I'll answer to myself - nothing.
This bullshit about something being cheap, it's guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or low-quality is really retarded, to tell you the truth.
I was in Brno on Hlavas recently and in the hallway the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take this stuff to help the guards, they can't throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of peasant wisdom and conservative views of how the world works, but nothing about God, so I was confused, but I knew it was going to be some kind of agitation.
I read it, found out who published it, and eventually it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like it was a good piece of junk, full of totally useless instructions, like washing up and not being a bitch.
Too bad about the paper, it wouldn't have to cut down the forest for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to accommodate that person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment early, she cried and begged me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
One year it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by and she started getting beat up.
Then I ended it by telling her I was breaking up and lying to her, but we could talk about it next week to calm her down and keep her from going crazy again.
Such a person sucks the emotions and joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurance companies are raiding the place furiously, buying up a cloud of tests and chasing positive ones who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if they didn't get tested.
All we're doing is making it more difficult for companies, carriers and others to get their employees in the random number generator to spend five days under house arrest.
In the West, they've given up on the clownishness and recognized that it's no use trying to treat a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Warlock is new and he has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing a buzzer.
I see we're getting our old junk back.
After several years of suppressing and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is once again in full swing.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first year at university), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly morphed into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring people and talking.
When the first money came in, it quickly became clear that if you wanted to make money, you had to buy a few products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profits, so you felt like a house potter.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, a lesson you learned not to jump to every detail and check the information thoroughly.
I wouldn't put them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even helpful to people, but they certainly will not brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen a lot of this in my corporate life.
HR is cool, managers are minding their own business, and they don't stick their noses in our business.
So, the regular evaluation is something that happens, in the form that it's done here, it's quite good (set some goals for next year, next year we'll see what works and what doesn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we're also a little bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're some kind of near-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us too much until the results come back.
The Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly 10 days, British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, December 12, the resigned Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradishtsko was found dead.
British police have unfortunately confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech national.
Cause of death is under investigation.
We're not going to release any further information on the case, due to family concerns.
"My condolences", Kulhánek tweeted.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on a bus on her way home from work, before she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began a search for her, and Interpol listed her as a missing person worldwide.
She's also been listed in the Czech missing persons database.
Police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
What role he played in the case and what he suspected, but she didn't release.
The four municipalities were allotted new seats by the end of the year.
On Saturday 11 December, new local councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradiště, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Libereck and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has been reduced below the number established by law or the elected representatives have disbanded.
The new elections saw 99 valid candidates contesting 28 seats.
The turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62 percent of eligible voters voted.
A total of eight women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidates were registered for the new elections in the four municipalities.
The 28 seats were contested by 36 women and 63 men.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72.
The results of Saturday's election symbolically close a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated municipal elections were held in the city, and the most watched election was for the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which made it more demanding to secure equipment and personnel, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last count was done on Sunday, December 12th at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Law Collection.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we had a pretty dangerous infectious disease in the very beginning, but it went without much fuss.
I have a problem with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population at all levels.
I'm looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidential office and his ability to regain it.
The chances of that actually happening are, as others here mention, very small.
Besides, I'm not sure if scrapping the file would even be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who do not have sex for a year is increasing
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
The majority of these are religious, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the percentage of people under 35 who gave up sex rose from eight to 21 percent.
The number of women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported having no sexual intercourse in the past year is higher than ever.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But the presence of the media, social networks, and video games that make sex a lesser and lesser priority for young people may also be contributing.
Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged 18-35 who report having had no sex in the previous year has risen rapidly, said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to have sex, with only 5% of them reporting having had no sex in the past year in 2021.
For single people, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married couples under 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided on the issue of premarital sex, with about 30 percent saying it's bad, while about 70 percent think it's okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is reversing this trend", Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious establishment.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the less religious, the trend has gone from 10 to 20 percent", Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during pandemics.
The study also found that people who were unemployed or had lower incomes were less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seem to reduce sexual desire.
People are spending more time online, which makes up for this need.
This trend has been particularly strong during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole COVID-19 vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a segment of the population to behave in ways that they don't want to, but that could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, but one that I'm most interested in personally is the question of social conscience.
I mean, for example, if we don't order them to do it and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, who didn't get a good explanation, who heard some misinformation, and as a result, didn't get vaccinated and ended up getting it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think we're responsible for the death of a staunch anti-vaccination who is here, alongside the SPD and the CCP, shouting about bullying and the totalitarian state.
From the statistics I've mentioned, it's pretty clear that most unvaccinated retirees are probably in the latter group, so they're really going to be able to do it themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter help combat drought?
This winter has brought one of the lowest snowfall rates in the Czech Republic in recent times.
The ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, and the weather complicates the preparation of the Jizerské pades.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about a pimp.
One day in high school, my teacher took us all over town to the boat yard so we could go boating on the river.
On our way there, we passed a rather wide street, and we don't see anyone in the middle - the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
Luckily, I escaped, but a friend of mine got into a conversation.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul", she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the docks.
We're so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozović
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations", Morawiecki told a joint press conference after the meeting.
The EU's foreign policy has been a major factor in the recent crisis in Ukraine.
The Chancellor said the crisis caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Norman Group" of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially triggered a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we are recording hundreds of attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He and the chancellor were discussing further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its Kremlin patrons would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of refugees by the Lukashenka regime.
A drunken Polish nun blamed the accident, tried to cover it up.
The car returned to the scene a short time later, but the driver was another nun who tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving priority and leaving the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted to hitting the car with another nun who asked for help.
The police came for Sister Celestine.
They gave her a breath test, and after finding that she had more than two thousand miles in her blood, they immediately revoked her license.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing what he can.
But Yuri Shaymovich didn't watch his movie.
Czech family comedy creators have seen eye to eye with American stories about pet dogs.
But they forgot one essential thing: the legality of the film industry.
After the quirky movie F.B.Gump, the dog that taught people how to live, another movie is competing for the audience's emotions in theaters.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmović Jr. is a loose follow-up to his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking badger Hugo returns to the stage with some famous characters around him.
Julia and Ivan, the owners of the Shumava boarding house, who are dying, and so they start inviting dog lovers, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She's not a little girl anymore. She's a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Shaymović (who is also the film's producer) had already struggled with the narrative procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were amused.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of awe and a sense of embarrassment.
Let's get this straight.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to the dark delusions of desire for a child and when the right constellation comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), veteran Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julija) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family is taken to the hospital so that the miraculous healing process of the dog can take place in the heart of the jungle solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the amount of content and imagery that was needed to convey this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dog show, a wild charlatan, cops coming to the show looking for drugs and discussing over herbs the fertile power of bone meal, which the baked family at the boarding house, of course, drinks.
When the heroine wakes up from a severe coma and then sits waving and smoking a cigar at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and flaccid as a cured vegetarian, she cannot help but laugh.
And then the director explains to the audience that sometimes this happens after a coma.
Shaymovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to expose supporting situations, sense for characters and the point and directing.
The acting is uneven, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is stained.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their party together, they don't have much to play for.
The only thing that remains of the film are the poetic images of the nature of the forest of the cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of badgers.
It is not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog sayings, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions the characters use.
It's not even a long-term membership in the Badger Club, as in the case of the producer.
Good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog must be accompanied by knowledge of the craft if one is to tell a believable story.
That didn't work out in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of genre sensibility.
Even as a canister therapy commercial, this amateur piece wouldn't have made it.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from the very same morons like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and here's how you understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer is always no.
If you listened to that kid all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case, a payday.
The Middle East has been plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual", the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term rainfall in November.
So this week's two days of rain was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It's also the perfect Christmas scene, said Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and it is intermittent and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fire.
Not only forests, but also drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been overflowed this spring because of three recent rainy winters.
The level has been dropping ever since.
Water officials warned of drought a long time ago.
Depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may be expected to decline, predicted Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies like desalination or wastewater recycling.
The economically weak countries are worse off, such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.
The streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, are being filled with tankers.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"My orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent this year compared to the previous two years", said tanker driver Imad Suleyman in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes have broken out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely drained.
The region is experiencing its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing for a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli Defense Minister said that the Vienna talks had not brought any progress and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Foreign Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a possible military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is based in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not brought "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them".
This happened to me about three years ago.
The lady liked me a little bit and grilled me during the interview to find out what she wanted from me.
I finally found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these tricks, I bombarded the young lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
You can call me a crook, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains for the weekend, with plenty of snow and nice weather ahead
The Czech Republic's ski resorts experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, snow is not a threat and some ski areas have now started operations.
The driver was not deterred by the requirement to show a Covid certificate on trains.
While tow trucks do not complain about lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people took to the trails and slopes in Liberec County over the weekend.
The skiers enjoyed the sunny weather and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out of that Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill", praised the interest of the Director of the Ještěd Sports Complex Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to the Autumn skiing in the first weekend of the new season.
For example, the Karlov Ski Arena or the Branné on Šumpersko ski resort were opened.
The weekend was very decent, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Walk.
Ski resort operators may only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or who are on the COVID-19 death list.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared and show the necessary documents, said ČTK René Hroneš from the ski center Špindlerův Mlýn.
"We've only recorded a single incident", he added.
Some ski rental and equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, the interest in ski rentals is there.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects more traffic during the ski season.
Also, the manager of the Snowbear company in the Royal Castle, David Shinták, feels that due to COVID, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
He said people have become lazy and learned to stay home.
On the contrary, the rental office in the Novako on the God's Gift area is in high demand.
The ski rental service started a week ago and now people have to order in advance.
We start renting the racetracks this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year, said the operator of the area Pavlína Nováková.
The interest, which is comparable to the pre-epidemic period, is also for the ski school.
If we want the rich and successful to stay away from going abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here as they would abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart, smart people go abroad who have no assets here.
A business owner doesn't just go abroad.
But I'm totally with the rest of you.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started with Orbán winning one day, he ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the election at all.
If it's a bad place to live, some traditional V4 nutcase might win.
The young and educated will leave, but there will be his supporters and people whose possessions cannot be put on the plane.
That's a scary picture!
Langmair in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the Island crew, led by 55-year-old J. Langmajer, enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is this a trial for the film?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very concerned about her", said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department where Srncova worked in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and simply want to know where she is", she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 on Sunday, November 28th and was heading home to Camberwell.
She was last reported seen on the bus about a half hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her associates.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a nurse's assistant at the Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petru, who is missing", a group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police", the statement continued.
Member of Parliament Harriet Harman has called for public cooperation. She spoke about Srncova's case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for days, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death", said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel we all have a particularly big responsibility to try and find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, working here for our healthcare", Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, police have not provided any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that much.
That's not "huge numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps saying that we're exaggerating the threat of invasion and they're getting tired of our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know how you can tell Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
Comparing it to the situation in '38 is off in so many ways, I don't even know where to start.
I can compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be.
Well, the pacta sunt servanda is a pact between...
New timetables in Prague from Sunday, mainly for suburban routes
Passengers on Prague's integrated transport (PID) are expecting several changes from Sunday, which concern mainly suburban connections.
New lines were built, some changed routes, and others disappeared.
Mladobleslavsko is a new member of the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, the express trains from České Budějovice stop at the station Garden City.
The suburban railway services are operated by trains S7, which run from Beroun to Český Brod through Prague's main station.
The newly commissioned Prague-Zahradní Město station will be the new stop of the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešova.
The PID will be extended to other areas.
Buses will run to Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Starých Splavů and Turnova, among other places.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including routes with connections to the Liberec and Královéhradec regions.
The integration will see 77 routes cancelled, 37 new routes introduced and 12 existing routes upgraded.
From Prague Zličín, a new bus line 405 will leave, which will go all the way to Žatka.
A new direct connection between Prague  Kralovice and Kanovník has also been established, replacing the cancelled train line S53.
The morning rush hour will be enhanced and the Prague-Krakovnik connection will be strengthened at the weekend when the new express line 404 will be launched.
The newly included PID system is the lines 400 and 410 to the Liberec region.
They leave from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubba and Česká Lípa to Novi Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburek or Cvikov.
The 410 supplementary line runs through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimona and Jablonný in Podjesštědi.
On the contrary, new services are cancelled or restricted on a dozen local routes in central Bohemia, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmital near Tremšín.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the railway's modernization, long-standing restrictions continue on the Prague  Beroun, Prague  Lysá nad Labem and the Cologne area.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled railway lines or a section is being extended on line 420 from Dobříše with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsk.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Hořovicka in the Pilsen region are being modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-to-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option for where to get food is to go next door to Billy's or a little further up to Lidl.
Since I have no exercise, no strength to exercise after work, I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'm in a hurry to get a pizza bagel and a yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: What healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Only the top of a tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're banning us from off-piste, but it's one of them.
I wasn 't looking forward to this at all .
Czech show business mogul has been living off the news of the relationship between Dary Rollins and Pavel Nedved since Friday.
They've been together since summer. The famous football player even divorced the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to her fans explaining why she kept her love from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not know that Dara caught a bear, so sorry, Nedvěda", jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But he said he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days of the spotlight, and although they're used to the public interest, they're not happy about it.
And here it is.
"What we both didn't expect, but we knew would happen", the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't care and it pops out of the can, or us, whose lives they're dissecting in detail.
It's like if one of you wanted to hear your opinion about whether you and your spouse or girlfriend were compatible, or you insisted that everyone know the details of your ex-partners and your list of mistakes and failures.
That's what you want, it's what's bothering Dara.
The two met in Italy, where Rolins was heading to work on her new fashion collection.
Nedved is also a long-time vice-president of Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife, Ivana, had been separated for three years, not married on paper, but only three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We're only human, too, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and just as he's by my side, I'm by his side, for better or worse, "Rolins concluded.
Hey, I think the other commenters have said all the basics, but I just want to say that the colleges are great for the beginning, and my classmates usually meet and make friends in the first semester or two, and then they find a place to live together, which I think is the best option, because you know who you're gonna be living with.
Apartments don't usually advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it sure doesn't hurt to look at the listing.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejla, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovska, Frenchska, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenic are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Vulture district is very student-friendly, the King's Field and it's nice in that direction, besides it's close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know exactly where you're entering).
I've never looked for a rent, but I'm a native Brno, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you still lack any information :)
That's an example of perfectly normal thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually quite okay that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either they can learn what they want and pay for it on their own, or they can go by the government and pay for it.
We can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to the full state subsidy and he can learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when written by a person who two days earlier commented on a petition to boycott the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've seen in cataloging/digitisation that (even long-time professionals) either throw it out of sight or write something in the form of xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it's illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I'd sort of deal with it in a note, depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a good, hardworking student, you can look up some character databases and find the one closest to you.
But since it looks like you're taking it from a book, I'd guess the author or printer simply created their own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Is it more like the Odrysian Kingdom than the Odrysian?
P.S.S.: Someone's already cracked this for you.
Check out that comment with Phil.
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea of them approving something because no one understood a text is ridiculous.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, and a basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, for building up high-level relationships.
And the English thing is pretty interesting, after the UK left the EU.
I don't understand the hat on Ceil.
I've been working there for three years and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive home from work at 10pm and never have a problem?
Only someone who's never been there before can say it's a ghetto.
Yeah, most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they don't have:D
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the city, I'm all for it.
There are a lot of newly renovated or newly built apartments there now.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemova as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle at the Advent wreath, but Felix Slovak did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
"I've seen a grandmother's wreath, and I'm sure Lucy has one too", said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patras's words that he visits her often.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after he left.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he's going to be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
But we kept talking, so Christmas never came.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy presents all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy something for Dad and Lucia, like perfume.
"I'm a gentleman", added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to play with, says the Slovak, who was happy to meet the wife of Luďek Soboty Adriana or the singer Kamila Nyvltová.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford to have no soldiers and no guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
The police are scarce and can't afford it, and the fire department, and nowhere else is the percentage of people with medical training at that level so high.
And the fact that our army is able to defend only Ostrava is a blow to the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
The country must not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
Scientists say that water levels have dropped in mountain and sub-mountain areas, and even in areas where there has been no need for moisture, there has been less rainfall.
Climate change is the cause of the drought in much of central Europe.
But the impact is also amplified by the way we manage the land.
What can you do to prepare for drought?
And how can we help nature in its time of need?
Yeah, I'm gonna be, I can barely keep up with the ice skates, I don't know what hockey is, and this tactic (I tried it on Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total delusion.
And whether you're a hockey team, "Bear Russia" or "China Lama", losing by two goals even though you don't have to win at all costs is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, I listen to Czech commentators who are pumping out, what the referees are noticing, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but it's like that with almost every sport, UEFA and "Italian players" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around, it's like always, and the fact that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more than it has won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs. "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of cases in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5,766 people in the hospital.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been reported.
It's the lowest number of days since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of Omicron infections, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Safety Authority, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be required.
Omicron cases are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
No one has died from omicron so far, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when the lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson's government has argued that the quiz was conducted "virtually", via a computer.
But it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the prime minister's office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: "Today two years ago, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as prime minister.
It's remarkable how quickly things have unfolded.
You want to turn around and save your own skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring elections that could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be an election of European significance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They're probably not going to be free either, because they weren't free in the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and does other tricks, big and small.
The last one sounds like everybody can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the contested districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it's gonna be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It used to be not whether Fidesz won but how much and whether it had a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a big unusual for Viktor Orban and his party.
Will they not play harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing.
A video of the speaker of parliament and Fidesz leader László Kövér explaining to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security was recently leaked to independent media.
Are these the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my parents, my mom's not very patient, neither am I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
I'm also very cholera-prone and I got so angry as a kid, I was on the floor in cramps and blue, and they took it out of my shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they patted me on the back, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency to do things with violence now, too, because I used to fight a lot when I was little, and now I hit myself in the face to get a kick out of it, and when I was younger, I would slap my parents on the hand, so I wouldn't get too hard on the mouth, so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine the extent of my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has a part to play.
I'm afraid I'll lose patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think beating kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at a time when it wasn't educational anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws up, I guess it's impossible not to screw up their kids a little bit, so I'm not gonna blame them.
I don't see why the O.P. should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call the people who make laws of this quality the Kundas.
Otherwise, I was wondering if you're not worried about a loss of income?
Can you really expect people to want and buy the product and you'll have the mortgage to pay for it?
The monstrous world of Kochner.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of the four accused in the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial will the process be for Slovakia?
It's the press that's responsible for this.
How is it that this petition got more media attention than the anti-petition from the deans of all medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got screwed and society took it back.
On Czech TV, he was dying of COVID six months ago.

The proposal of Minister Karl Havlíček needs to be radically revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrei Babis is over and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in selecting and authorizing a deep-seated repository of highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of consultation.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the municipalities concerned, which are members of the Platform against Deep-Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect the law to significantly strengthen their options in deciding on storage, as promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to rework the bill in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The proposal from Minister Karl Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is particularly criticised by the municipalities: the proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for the storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in the locality.
This can be ensured by requiring the warehouse administration to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposed draft terms of reference almost completely ignore public participation and make the citizens of the municipalities virtually mere extras in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a systematic set-up of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of finding and selecting a site for storage, its authorisation and operation.
Under current legal standards, local authorities have little real choice in defending the interests of their citizens when they are looking for a storage site.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their observations or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be granted.
Any action shall not have the effect of suspending the performance of the exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of local authorities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal firms to draft legislation.
In the present case, the contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. was concluded by SÚRAO and was a follow-up to the contracts with Jan Zemánek.
The total amount of these works is almost CZK 4 million, according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of Cejle from the village of Hrádek and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Waste, said: "After the ministers of industry who only deferred to their successors the alignment of the position of local authorities with the state authorities in the search for a deep-depth storage of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We're offering a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which sees the problem of insufficient rights for municipalities in such a major construction as well as the municipalities directly affected in selected locations.
The Anti-Deep Depth Repository Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the State's approach to spent fuel and other radioactive waste management that is not limited to deep-depth repository.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the location of any storage site be made subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) lost 200 pounds because of fear.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, doctors eventually frightened him.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 200 pounds [90 kg], half of his original weight of 400 pounds [180 kg], reports The Sun.
He boasted about his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat kid from the sitcom Roseanne is a whole different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth", the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to take it slow this time.
Moving, working out.
"I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still", said ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you are and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, like a college text, I'd probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more than one kind of boss for everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls, etc. has multiple bosses, right, so "boss" is something like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated at all to complete a game or level, but are often even more powerful than a standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player doesn't actually play them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
Well, then there are the mini bosses.
It's impossible to translate boss into a single word, Czech and other languages don't solve it.
It's simply a story or game in general, it's significant, it's computer-controlled, it's an opponent stronger than anyone before it, and it's guarding the completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for Peter from London.
The Czech police were involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Peter Srncova since December 3.
The Czech police have also joined the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradištsk has been wanted since December 7.
It also assists the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petar Srdenica was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow notice.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
'The Czech police are working closely with the British police,' confirmed police spokeswoman Katerina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case", she added.
A search warrant for Peter has appeared on the police website.
He says she's 5'6", thin, brown eyes, and long straight hair the same color.
She should be from Uherskohradištsk.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as she's very unusual for a disappearance like this.
The search for Peter has been joined by Harriet Harman, a member of the House of Representatives.
She was involved in the hanging of flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her", she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have arrested a suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it's not clear who he is or what he had to do with Petra.
The Czech Republic on Christmas Eve is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks increased significantly last month as the year drew to a close.
We recorded a major campaign involving Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is designed to draw the user's attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as a copy of the correction of the invoice for 11.2021...exe", said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored credentials and then sends them to the attackers.
The last major campaign was in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the holidays and the end of the year approaching, the attackers' activity is on the rise again.
The spyware Formbook remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November intercepted a campaign with a global reach.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously for a month, with increased activity on November 3, 10, and 15.
The formbook most commonly contained an attachment with the .exe prefix, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the receipt keeps coming up.
The Czech language version of the Annex may then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant drop and dampening of activity is being recorded by security analysts for Fareit, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had a major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the past few months.
The smart-ass demo today that doesn't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reports.
Based on the images of the march along the waterfront and my experience of the march, I'm not afraid of an estimate of 10,000 people.
The procession filled the waterfront, the bridge, and the opposite waterfront.
That's a lot of people.
The march of some 4,000 demonstrators is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passersby.
I'm saying something new is being born here.
That the continuing discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led them to find a common language.
Only anti-vaxers, anti-Russian and co. could fill or pay for a parade this big.
The "Stick the Dog" campaign is so popular, it reminds me of a million moments for reverse democracy.
Sometimes I get the impression that they're renting the same stage and the same equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement would pay off this discontent, depending not only on the money raised, but whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine becomes a four-dose or more vaccine.
It's definitely not a left-wing or centrist movement, I'll bet you that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because obviously we're going to have to get revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant scientific feat that mankind is rightfully proud of.
End of the trail, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister announcing change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has authorized the formation of a new government by Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November elections.
This has already led to the formation of a broad coalition government that should take office in a matter of days.
The country has been in a political crisis since April, when the previous government lost the election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties, who claimed to be fighting corruption and abuse of power, could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
From the secretly taken footage, it's a global hit.
Concerns have been growing in Britain over the weekend over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
The information about the employee of the children's hospital is being called not only by the police but also by her former employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very concerned about her", said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department where Srncova worked in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very worried about her and simply want to know where she is", she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 on Sunday, November 28th and was heading home to Camberwell.
She was last reported seen on the bus about a half hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her associates.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a nurse's assistant at the Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petru, who is missing", a group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police", the statement continued.
The amateur painter of children's rooms Zdenka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the pirate regional councilor) revealed anonymously that she violates copyright with her paintings.
But the court found that the murals in the Shumper rooms did not violate the law.
In the mouth of the Lab, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch fell for a month.
It was a matter of life and death.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the RSD, which owns the road, and since it did not respond, the hole continued to grow.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership and after a month the SSR began to deal intensively with the situation.
