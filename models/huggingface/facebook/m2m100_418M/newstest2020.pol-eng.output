Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white dress
He is a charismatic.
At the holy Mass he sent for liberation and healing the crowds are pulling.
He was a few years old when uninterpretable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience this.
The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
One day, the parents of a 7-month-old child had a hole of 7.5 mm in the heart.
It had to be operated.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
The doctors said: “Operation is not necessary, the loss is just 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In dreams, cleansing souls came to him and asked for help.
I was awake in the night and encouraged to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of a bad spirit.
And he had a vision of what is happening to a man who commits a deadly sin.
“My body has begun to change.
I’ve lost my human characteristics and I’ve begun to gain the appearance of the animal,” he says.
The invisible force brought him up, he could not get a voice out of himself.
He felt that he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“Down into the waters of the river symbolizing the holy baptism, I was released and returned to the human shape.”
He didn’t tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a calling in it.
He was 16 years old when he joined the French.
In the prophecy he did not just talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of the Renewal in the Holy Spirit
In the healing masses delivered by Father Witko, many people attend to get rid of the disease.
But the spiritual emphasizes that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not physical.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) afternoon, the team of Kolpinga FRAC merit was held with the current champion of Poland Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Super League of Table Tennis.
The players in such a personal list, which they presented with the grodishans, have no chances of winning with the league sovereigns.
It was a good match with Darth Vader.
The team is still missing, called to team leader, Chen Jingqi.
It may be the third in a row triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win with souls like Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most prospective Poles, namely Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellady was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorsky street in Jaroslav.
Both in standing with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class for themselves.
After three matches, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting, five-year struggle – Pavel Sirucka.
But then it was worse.
Gionis did not give Lei a chance.
It could still be hoped to win for two points, but Qiyao Han failed to Badowski.
There will be no additional studies for seniors.
Why ?
According to the announcement of Rafael Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive trials for seniors aged 70 and 80 should be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the acceptance of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tarification.
In the argument, the agency explained that the target group was badly performed.
“The above measures may even affect the detectiveness of individual diseases, which may contribute to deepening the difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort related to the false-positive results of the study,” it wrote.
The president of the capital does not understand the decision.
“The money is our, we predicted the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are examined, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is just about leading to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I don’t understand,” said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard for me to imagine that running specialists say: Let’s not investigate, because there will be longer lines with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, then I’m not surprised that the health service is in this state,” he added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that he will break any agreements with Israel if the future government of the country tries to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement on the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future Israeli government, as it will be formed, approaches the implementation of this plan, we will cancel all the agreements signed (with Israel) and we will withdraw from all the commitments taken,” he said.
“We will completely and completely reject the plan,” Abbas threatened with pressure.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – unimportant what the consequences of this will be – fully engaged in action for the implementation of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” the President of the Palestinian Autonomy said, who had already made similar statements in July.
Netanjahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, after the September 17th elections again received a mission to form a government.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won it, he will announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intends to incorporate all the Jewish settlements on the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements that the United States watched.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised in the United Nations General Assembly to hold general elections in the Palestinian territory.
The last was in 2006.
“After returning to the country, I call for local elections in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip and in Eastern Jerusalem, and all who oppose them will have to respond for their actions before God and the international community,” the Palestinian president said.
In his speech, Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, regarded as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to exercise the powers of “the full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader ended his speech with a call to the international community “to force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas’ speech, saying the Palestinian leader “will focus in the United Nations on the Palestinian Autonomy efforts against Israel, rather than fight against the calls to terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership.”
Danon, according to the agencies, did not refer to the Netanjahu's announced annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescue workers want defibrillators in newralgic points
The history of the border transition shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human lives.
The Military Emergency Rescue Station in Premyślu wants such devices to be located in the newralgic points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received grate diplomas from the Wojewódzkij Hektovij Ratunkowy Station in Premyslu.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officials of the Podkarpacky Customs Office in Promisel.
On August 28 they completed the service at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. a Customs Service official noticed a lieing unconscious man in the pedestrian movement zone.
A Chinese activist died in prison due to torture.
The rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, the secretary of the Communist Party from her family village called on September 23 to inform that the husband was just dead in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of his death, he did not reveal.
In the castle of Cao she saw the body of her husband massacred, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, his ears, his nose and his mouth were whole in blood,” she says.
“I was not allowed to take the cells with me, and there was a lot of police around that didn’t let me get closer to Wang.”
Police pressed to sign a statement that the husband was seriously sick and died as a result of a “unfortunate accident.”
$105 million for video games companies from the National Center for Research and Development
Approximately €105 million will be funded to gaming companies that create innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the GameINN III edition.
Nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR include the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on an AR game engine that creates a real-world map with an application that allows users to transmit data; a test-training platform for the verification of practical skills at work and professional improvement using VR and AI technology; an innovative game that simulates real-world production process management using an innovative game model based on the interaction of virtual world with the real-world using the concept of industry 4.0 – provided in the NCBR communication sent on Friday.
The goal of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video gaming industry in the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is growing at a rate of 10 percent per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was 1.85 billion PLN, while the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion PLN.
“The special prepared GameINN research agenda and the already reaching €300 million support for entrepreneurs within the framework of this sectoral program are a significant impulse for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” we read in the communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective exploitation of the potential we have in Poland.
“The government’s incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as B+R facilities, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by NCBR, drive the innovative business and enable them to compete more effectively on a highly competitive market,” said Vice-President, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin.
The head of the research department notes that the money for innovation is not only coming to innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefit from B+R in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of calculated costs related to B+R activities amounted to 1.7 billion PLN, which gave more than 300 million PLN of savings to companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three GameINN editions,” the Deputy Prime Minister stressed.
The NCBR director Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that in the two previous subsidy competitions of a total value of over 211.2 million PLN, 78 innovative projects were awarded.
The tremendous interest in the III competition and the diversity of proposals show that the video game industry has the ideas and competencies to continue to grow and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is pleased that among the outlet projects – like in previous editions – there are projects related to solutions not only for entertainment but also related to industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to 20 million PLN could apply entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial consortium and entrepreneurial consortium with scientific units.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total funding amount of approximately 317 million PLN.
The budget of the contest at the time of the announcement of the contest was 100 million PLN, but it was increased, thus 27 projects were granted almost 105 million PLN of funding.
Detailed information on the results of the GameINN III contest is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector program is implemented as part of the Intelligent Development Operational Program.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga acknowledges stealing Kasper Dolberg clock
The incident occurred on 16 September.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, noticed after training that his clock had disappeared from the closet.
It’s not enough because it’s worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Danish next day did not appear at the classes, interpreting himself with stomach problems.
It was mysterious from the beginning.
Players in the dressroom have private seals available, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga has finally admitted to theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other team colleagues and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danish to return the money for the clock.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most prospective young generation footballers in France.
He arrived at Nice at the age of thirteen to debut in the first team three years later.
He played in seven matches this season.
He has recently signed a professional contract, but – as the newspaper L’Equipe – the club is likely to resolve it with an immediate effect.
He has begun a disciplinary trial against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Check if you wash your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. when you come home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of the infections, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now when autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds to wash enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us wash it shorter.
It’s enough warm water and simple soap – it’s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even deny it).
By washing, we steam not only the legs and corners of the hands, but also: the ends of the fingers (connected or individually) – steam them with colistic movements to the inside of the other hand, the space between the fingers (preplate the hands, steam with the fingers about each other), the fingers – each stick we cover with the other hand and in such a cover we turn it for a moment to the right and to the left.
In an emergency (when you can't wash your hands) you should stretch your hands with a wet cloth, and then use an antibacterial gel (in pharmacies, from 5 pounds).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door or door with washed hands (recommendation from the Head Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them through a paper towel.
Iran's President says he rejected the proposal for U.S. talks, Donald Trump denies
Tehran has failed to negotiate with the U.S. side during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. proposal to abolish the sanctions, Iran’s President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it is the Iranian side that has called for the removal of the restrictions, which he did not agree with.
According to Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have proposed the abolition of all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in return for negotiating a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear program and the ballistic missile construction program.
Rowhani: Iran will not negotiate in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said he did not agree to take these talks because of the “toxic atmosphere.”
He said he had met with U.S. diplomats because he was affected by France, Germany and the UK.
However, he said Iran will not negotiate in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one is able to predict what the final result will be,” Rowhani said.
One day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not exclude talks with the U.S. and denounced the European parties to the nuclear deal of promoting U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal “have a pre-condition that does not allow” for dialogue.
If we succeed in suppressing this pre-condition and if the United States eliminates the sanctions and maximum pressure, then, of course, we can talk to the United States.
He added that he does not exclude meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a conversation in the coming week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that it was he who rejected the request by the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to abolish the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said “No!” the President of the United States said.
The Atomic Agreement in the Background
France, Germany and the UK are trying to mitigate tensions between Washington and Tehran in a way to rescue the 2015 agreement with Iran, which they were signatories.
In exchange for the withdrawal of economic sanctions, Iran will give up its nuclear weapons program and the nuclear sector will be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far nothing has come out of it.
Washington applies the tactics of making maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it will not be allowed to export raw materials, it will limit its commitments from the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Wojewódzkij Administrativny Court in Warsaw and the husband of heiterka Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the stalking against the judges, was returned to judgment by the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: there has not been a disciplinary proceedings against him, and therefore there is no reason to support the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to withdraw him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, launched an investigative proceedings against Schmidt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into a proceedings against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the President of the WSA within a month from its release.
In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about his wife’s mental problems to discrete her, who due to suspicion of participation in the heiter group was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Schmydt denies his participation in the Heather group.
He claims that there is no evidence for this except the false screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.
This is exactly the same as the other judges associated with the “Casta”: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it is quite possible that they will put on their own.
Because the prosecutor's office didn't kick the finger to secure evidence from their telegraphs, it's also silent about the content of the phone Emilia Schmydt, which the phone stopped in June in another case.
The police did not kick the finger to safeguard the devices of persecutors, which Judge Waldemar Žurek indicated as persecutors in a February report.
There is no evidence – there is no matter of Schmidt, there is no matter of “Casty”.
There is also no case with NIK chief Mariana Banasia about renting the stone to the sutener and hiding the revenue.
CBA verifies its asset statements.
He will check when he will check.
The Parliamentary Ethics Commission will not take care of Banasi, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered to make a curious decision on the revocation of Banasi’s Deputies and the appointment as a p.o. of his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a curious combination).
It all reminds me of a new American film about how a wife returns home and holds her husband with a girlfriend in bed.
She is so astonished and disturbed that she can’t cross the word.
It stands in the door, and during this time, the girlfriend quickly jumps out of bed, clothes and goes out.
My husband put his bed.
When the wife recovers the voice and screams: What is it to be?
Who is that woman?
The man calmly asks: What woman, dear?
Only the case of “Kasta” or Banasia is a parody of the state.
And that is not funny at all.

Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in severe condition
He went to the hospital and the doctors described his condition as severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and aware.
“We hope that he will win again.
We are all praying for him to get back to health,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with Super Express journalists.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is a candidate for the Senate.
“The family and the politics closest to me keep life,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview that he gave to Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to the Military Hospital in Wroclaw for trials.
“There were strange, annoying symptoms and I went to the hospital.
I thought I had a yellow.
The worst was before me.
“When a computer tomograph examination was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer,” the Prime Minister’s father said.
A few days later in the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki passed a serious operation.
According to Moraviecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal captain Priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know that many people have prayed for me and I am very grateful for it.
Fortunately, I have no mutations.
I don’t know if I’m going to get chemotherapy.
I give myself in the hands of doctors specialists who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this hard operation, I have to return to some state of usability.
I hope everything will be fine," Kornel Morawiecki said in a conversation with "SE" in January.
“If I was too late to submit to the investigation, the situation would be tragic and I would say goodbye to that I’ve fallen,” he added.

The power of the jump.
The title of relationships from amateur sports matches, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hipodrome near Oleandry Street in Oław, may be for some misleading.
The way to true power is far, but this is the name of one of the types of horse competition.
The competition of the power of jumping consists in overcoming by the rider and horse increasingly high obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long and still unbeaten world record, established in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse “Huaso”, is 247 cm.
So high in Oław, of course, no one jumped, but the outcome of the best local amazonets at the level of 135 cm also is not the worst.
The competitions organized by the untouched Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS “W Siodle” were a showcase part of somewhat earlier played there “Touch Riding Competitions”, about which we write broader in this number of the newspaper, on page 22.
The competition was attended by eight amazoners who trained riding in the Olavsk JKS.
Four competed on horses and four on large horses.
In the first group it was best written by Nikola Szołdra, who reached the crazy "Sprinter".
This small but dynamic rumak began with overcoming the obstacles spread to a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper belka away from the ground by 125 cm.
However, it was not easy to give up and only after three more rejection was removed by the jury from further competition.
The second place was held by Amelia Pawlak, “Famy”, and the third Lena Boruń at “Harmider”.
The youngest player of the tournament, Inga Aksman, was struggling and jumping through the obstacles on the small "Carmen" clock.
Even more excitement was accompanied by the starting amazoners and the viewers during the competition with large horses.
Threatening falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who reached the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the “Lotce”.
Fortunately, in addition to the small submissions, neither the Amazon nor the horses did nothing wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of trouble with the introduction of the young "Wineta" clock on the park had the accompanying Weronika Łuczkiewicz.
She needed either an assistant coach, or another horse to a pair, behind which a little crazy "Wineta" was swallowed.
After counting the obstacles from the park, she was also running full, so at times in the boxing and on the spread room it was dangerous. “Everything is under control!”, Jan Sienkiewicz calmed some of those scared spectators, especially the youngest.
Since the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska has been writing well on the park, a beautifully presented "Whisky".
This decent clock, in conjunction with an experienced Amazon, after the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and this was the best at the time result of the matches.
After a moment, however, the same height was counted by Paulina Szewczyk on the “Declaration”, Veronika Luczkiewicz on the “Winete” and Anastasia Abramenko on the “Lotce”.
To the decoration of the flo and after receipt of material awards in the form of riding equipment all of these players went out together, and at the end, together with the amazons on the coats in the takt of the Radecki march, they conducted an effective honour round, ending these interesting and exciting matches.
Thanks
The Jeździecki Sportovní Klub „V Siodle“ heartily thanks the sponsors of the competition for the power of jump during the XVI “Tęczowych Jeździeckich Zawodów”: the Municipal Office in Oław, the Waterways and Sanitation Factory in Oław, the Air Council and the company “Mustang”.
The Patriot Revolution of Max Colonko
The Patriot Revolution of Max Colonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Max Colonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko promised cooperation with Mark Jakubiaki or Paul Kukiz, however, no one of these coalitions came, and the Patriot Revolution Max Kolonko himself did not even gather enough signatures to issue letters in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Colonko has announced on Twitter that he has terminated cooperation with the Patriot Revolution of Max Colonko.
“I’d be waiting for my name to be removed from the name.
I will accept that you do not join my person with the aforementioned entity,” he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his action or whether it is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on the U.S. Independence Day, U.S. journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Colonko has been out of running on the YouTube portal of the Max TV channel, on which he commented on events in Poland and the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough your hard games, enough your amateur governments.
It is time for the power in the state to take over the people and rule for the good of the people,” Colonko said.
The party’s programme included, among other things, issues relating to justice (will be elected in general elections), tax changes (comparation of tax-free amounts for all), war repairs (in the form of military aid for the countries of the eastern flank of the NATO, with particular attention to Poland), the conduct of a referendum on the possession of weapons, the limitation of the number of members or the introduction of one-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the creation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began conversations with Mark Jakubiaki.
In late July, Colonko posted on his profile on social media information suggesting that #R will combine forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
Nevertheless, no one of these coalitions eventually arrived.
UBS: Gold Close to Balance Point
“The euro will remain around the threshold of £4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak co-operation on the global markets,” said Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations ofining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak for the stabilization of gold notes on the current threshold,” the expert assesses in a conversation with Bankier.pl.
According to him, despite the clear inflation pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in a environment where the vast majority of central banks are relieving the policy.
“While gold is properly valued – the euro notes should beined in the coming months around the 4.35 zlotys threshold – the Polish bonds are not attractive.
Much more profitable than Polish papers offer bonds from emerging markets,” says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to experts, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global condition.
“Global slowdown may continue to deepen, but it shouldn’t lead to a severe recession, and above all to a slightly lower GDP dynamics than zero,” said Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should refuse global shares that may be damaged by the lack of prospects for the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should be the relatively weakest,” says Mark Haefele, CEO of UBS Wealth Management, in a recent letter to investors.
“The shares from the euro area countries should behave worse than the U.S. because they are more susceptible in the conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowing down,” we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the holding on the bond markets of the safest countries dropped the German 10-year profitability to minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the profitability decline.
However, in the long run, the profitability of long-term papers should no longer fall, but only short-term papers, because of the monetary policy of the banks.
The Fed has the largest field to lower rates, which is expected to lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency in the horizon of the coming years.
The long-term balance point for the euro notes is the $1.29 threshold, which would mean a 19-percent potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We expect a further drop in the Fed’s rates, which will result in a decrease in the monetary policy in the world.
“To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term, the current and budget deficits may not be allowed,” says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses weapons.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition, according to a confidential report by the RFN defense department.
This was by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary Secretary of State in the MON Peter Tauber (CDU) has so far managed to redirect two pieces of weapons, one part of weapons and 3,474 pieces of ammunition.
Among the military equipment, which is still missing, are among other things: six universal MG3 machinery missiles, 11 G3 automatic missiles, four G36 automatic missiles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
Furthermore, there are 30 laws missing for MG3 machinery missiles.
The situation is concerned by Lewica’s deputy chairman, Martina Renner.
As she told reporters RND, the number of missing pieces of weapons and ammunition is “removing.”
Moreover, as a result of the investigation, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a “low balance”.
She also criticized the fact that the list does not show whether there is also a weapon that was found during an investigation against Bundeswehr commander Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a severe act of violence threatening state security and violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.
The official was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians from extreme right-wing and racist initiatives.
His "black list" of goals, which came into the prosecutors' hands, included the then Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defenders and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally entered into possession of four pieces of firearms, more than 1,000 pieces of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Children in the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently used a feature designed for people for whom traveling with a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines enable you to check the layout of seats in the aircraft.
If a minor travels to the second year of age, the “child icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by the parents or caregivers.
Thus, the person who uses the service of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place far from that occupied by the little one.
The BBC reports that the lines have already the imperfection of this solution.
"The child's icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the aircraft has been changed at the last moment.
As expected, the idea shared the internet users.
Some Twitter users indicate that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved using noise-reducing headsets.
They were children, and we were them.
“We need to learn tolerance because soon we will begin to need maps of seating places for breathing mouths, swallowing or drunk,” G Sundar wrote.
Another of the internet users noticed that he was once disturbed by the crying children in the plane, but he changed his mind when he himself became a parent.
There is also no lack of supporters of the Japan Airlines solution.
“Thank you for warning me of screaming children during the 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Mumbai's bankruptcy of Thomas Cook travel agency
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Mallorca in October as a result of Monday’s bankruptcy announced by Thomas Cook’s travel agency.
The representative of the autonomous Balearic government, Marc Pons, said on Friday that among the 25,000 temporists who will not be able to take advantage of the October vacation in Mallorca, there are also people who had to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, such as the company Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected temporaries who due to the British company’s bankruptcy had to resign from the vacation in the coming month are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.
However, as Pons says, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not guide tourists to the Balearic island in the period November-August, the losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government has already started negotiations with international operators on the “exit to the Mallorca market” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The Diario de Mallorca newspaper estimates that over 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Mallorca.
Around 800 people are dismissed from Thomas Cook’s office in Palm.
Other people lose their jobs mainly in the hotel industry.
On Monday, with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many Mallorca hotels, property owners asked guests to pay an additional accommodation fee.
This has been experienced by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that a few dozen hotels in Mallorca have stopped operating at least by the end of October due to the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and the companies that cooperate with him.
On Friday’s Diario de Ibiza newspaper indicates that the majority of Ibiza’s operating hotels, which worked with the Thomas Cook group, do not deal with the intention of closing facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island a British bankruptcy co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they will ask the Spanish government to support the region with an amount of €100 million to cover the losses caused by the announcement of the bankruptcy by the Thomas Cook Travel Office.
They revealed that the most injured tourists on this archipelago, about 36 thousand people, are in Mallorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook has charged local tourist companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019 about 5 million euros.

The male representation of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd.
“Rz”: Smog has shattered the government
“The effects of the ‘Clean Air’ program are fine, and the coal pieces will climb this winter as if never anything,” we read on the first page of today’s ‘Rzeczpospolitej’.
So far, 82 thousand subsidiary applications have been submitted under the Clean Air Programme, of which 48 thousand have been positive.
Accepted requests rely on a total of over 915 million zlotys,” says “Rz”, referring to data from the environmental minister’s adviser.
According to the newspaper, only a portion of the costs are returned from the program.
The results of the announced bullying program the journal is assessed as "smart".
The self-governers, quoted by the “Rz”, see the failures of the “Clean Air” among other things in too large bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic registration, sending invoices by mail, possible profitable implementation check.
This would improve the action,” said Lidzbarka Warminsky mayor Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm noted that in the first year of action, less than 1% of the established target was achieved to exchange 3 million climbing cats.
As “Rz” notes, although the program’s budget is 103 billion PLN for 10 years, or 10 billion PLN annually, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and Water Economy for this year reserved a raft of 1.4 billion PLN,” we read.
Congress approves F-35 for Poland
Tags: now price negotiations
The U.S. Congress approved the sale of 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work,” Mariusz Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will hardly negotiate to the most affordable price,” the Polish minister added.
Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by the Lockheed Martin Group.
In the middle of September, the U.S. Department of State approved their sale to Poland.
The communication emphasizes that the investment will support U.S. national security and foreign policy by improving the security of NATO allies, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for the fighter.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, the performance of engineering, logistics and personnel services and related elements of logistics and program support and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II, produced by the Lockheed Martin Group, is a single-sided and single-sided five-generation multi-sided fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close support missions, bombings and typically fighter air struggle tasks.
Thanks to the application of stealth technology, the fighter is uncoverable for near-range radars.
The F-35 was recently purchased by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the ageing F-16.
The purchase of U.S. combat aircraft will also be considered by other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie has launched a series of sex-neutral dolls.
This is how we are fighting stereotypes.
Barbie has launched a series of sex-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin colors, shapes and hairstyles, Mattel has introduced sex-neutral dolls for sale.
The gameplay series “Creatable World” wears pearls.
Children can decide whether their Barbie should have short or long hair.
Their closet consists of both pants and clothes.
In the blindness of the eye, dolls can become boys from girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
They also refused to emphasize the characteristic gender characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long wrinkles and thin back or – in the case of Ken – wide arms.
The company believes that children don’t like when their dolls have imposed gender norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with the idea of a particular sex inhibit the girl’s ambitions and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
“New dolls will allow all children to feel free,” Mattel said.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and high-covered shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes”, such as unnatural body proportion.
The group responded to the criticism and has already introduced on the market dolls with different skin colors, as well as more round shapes.
But the dolls also appeared in the hijab.
Zandberg: Circle or Club Together may have several members
Zandberg asked in the ZET radio, how many candidates his party can get to the Sejm from the list of leftist groups (KW SLD from which the list is launched by candidates to the Sejm SLD, Spring and Lewica Together, launching with the common logo “Lewica”), replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Lewica will be very good because we feel that people are bound to hope that the Lewica is not only right, but also strong,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left could have 60–80 members.
“It may mean that around or the club Together will have a few members.
This depends on Poles and Poles.
I’m not going to guess and tell you how this will happen,” he said.
Asked whether the Lewica Together will have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not assume that this diversity does not exist.
I think this diversity has been rewarded by the Poles because we have shown that by differentiating, we have been able to agree on a common program.”
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he thought the biggest beneficiaries are the central-left and the left voters.
In turn, considering that the SLD will receive all the subsidy, he said that “the goal of the political party is to represent its voters.”
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Seymour elections.
In the Senate election, he said he was thinking.
“The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further,” he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the 44th Senate district, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
“I’t try to give a vote to Minister Kazimier Ujazdovsky,” he added.
In this district outside Ujazdovskiy, the leader of the People of the Republic of RP Pavel Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start.
Dakar: West Africa's largest mosque opened
Thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital to inaugurate the massive mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by buses, cars and by foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built, which could accommodate 30,000 faithful.
The building was built by the brotherhood of Mouride, which belongs to the sofistic north of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
The work on the mosque began ten years ago on a submarine area of six hectares, transferred by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque ("Roads to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, honored by the faithful as a saint.
The mosque is covered with carryal marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle will accommodate 15,000 faithful, and the second can be on the external esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors, you can admire the wrapped cottage, giant gyrandols and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the mosque is still not compared to the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassana II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was funded by private donations.
The government, in addition to land, has funded lighting, sanitary equipment and funded road work worth €10.5 million.
Trainer Smyla: Our problem is not Slysk, but we ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without victory will be attempted by the Crown footballers to break in a Friday meeting with the wicelider of the extraklasy Slezsky.
“Our problem isn’t snoring, only we ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” said coach Mirosław Smyla.
The Crown players last and as so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first round, when they defeated 1:0 Beniaminka of the Cancers of Frequently.
Later the cups recorded two remises and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with Lubin in 1/32 final of the Cup of Poland.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the Cup, the footballers were fighting for a gate, they wanted to remove.
Their fall to the mural after the last strike did not result from a break, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close,” Smyla said.
As he noted, Śląsk has very strong wings, so it will feel the team to play in the side sectors of the battlefield.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” the coach added.
In the Friday match in the Crown will not play a break for the excess of yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, in the role will also be missing the contusions of Jakub Žubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
In addition, it is important to sign up for a cup match of several players with the desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it won’t be, and now it’s,” Smyla said.
The defense of the Crown Daniel Divniel emphasized that Slezsk will not be a easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without a victory, while in the extraclass everyone can win with everyone.
“We are a good team.
We may not be showing it on the field in the past few weeks, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday,” he said.
After nine rows, the Crown with a score of five points occupies the 15th place.
He got 12 more and is on the second place.
The match will start on Friday at 20.30.
These trees could completely disappear from Europe.
“42 percent of the trees in Europe are in danger,” the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) warns in the Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
On the top of the list are, among other things, the castles and the jarzabina.
The IUCN, a organization based in Gland, Switzerland, has published a list of threatened European trees for the first time.
According to researchers, 42% of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) are “high-danged.”
Among the reasons the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most dangerous are the trees and crops that exist only or mainly on our continent.
According to the IUCN, 58 percent of the species are at risk, and 15 percent, 66 species of trees and trees, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of the trees, accelerated urbanization, too intense trees, and further forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of trees, mohs and crops is also strongly threatened.
“Human activity disasters lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe of the extinction of important and unprecedented varieties that are the foundation of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet,” said Luc Bas, the European Bureau of the IUCN.
GREEGORZ SHETINA: I don't promise 600+
“Today PiS wants to overthrow the Poles, offering them for freedom a loan that future generations will have to pay,” Grzegorz Schetyna said in an interview with the “Rzeczpospolitej”.
He said, “the whole politics is a pic.”
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken.”
Schetyna assures in a conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea of defeating Law and Justice.
It is about the mobilization of the electorate in the elections.
He believes that the opposition has a greater potential in this field than the Kaczynski party.
“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than PiS’s supporters, a party that has transmitted itself to the promised values such as humility, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.
The leader of the Civil Coalition and the chairman of the Civil Platform also pointed out the basic principles of the electoral program KO.
“First, nothing that is given will not be taken, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because PiS only deals with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which is visible even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it’s about “shut down the energy of the Poles, helping and investing in those who work faithfully – and those who are entrepreneurs.”
Schetyna explains that in the KO program was found, among other things, a project that the least earning Poles will give more of 614 PLN per hand, and the more earning – also for a few hundred.
The politician also said he did not want to go for distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he does not promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers were competing with the opposition for distribution until the financial collapse of the country ended,” he said.
Schetyna in an interview with "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and the Małgorzata Kidawa-Blanskaya.
“We’d see their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“The breath goes before the fall.
Kaczynski is such a man of the state as Bananas is crystal,” he added.
The PO leader also said he has not yet decided whether to apply for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six dead large condors have been found, TVN24 reports.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The large condors were probably poisoned by a means to kill draper such as pumps, lies, or wild dogs.
Animals could eat toxic paddle.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condors were adult.
“This is a huge environmental loss because the condor has to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and reproductive.
So we lose the protected species, the species in danger,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, the Argentine environmental organization.
“I think that the use of toxic poison and poison threatens not only this species, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
“Rz”: They want a jewelry for the president
The work on the award of the head of the state of the precious chain has begun.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrei Dudy – we read in “Rzeczpospolitej”.
As the newspaper explains, it is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the treasure of the Republic.
Probably the last time it was used by President Ignacy Mościcki.
“Rz” says that soon such a chain may fall on the arms of Andrey Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday a proposal to work on the amendment of the law on orders and remittances to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain of state head.
The Senate already proposed this amendment in 1992, but it failed with one vote.
This time the work is fast.
At the beginning of August, the senators dedicated a few minutes to the matter and recognized that they would consult the President's Office's opinion.
It arrived in mid-September.
“I am pleasantly informing that the Chancellor of the President of the Republic of Congo does not comment on the position presented in the petition in question,” President Andrzej Dera wrote.
On Wednesday, the Senate commission continued the matter and gave little time to the matter again.
“President’s headquarters answered us briefly: it’s for it to restore it,” said commission chief Robert Mamutov from PiS, quoted by “Rz”.
He submitted a request for legislative work, which the Commission supported.
Police will teach drivers how to ride through the cross
Police action will be conducted, among other things, on the crossroads of al. Ciepliński from al. Piłsudski.
The uniform activities are somehow related to the recent complaints of the city authorities on drivers who are not always able to properly behave on the crossroads.
On Friday, 27 September, the police began in Rzeszov preventive operations “Transitional crossings”.
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: entering the crossroads without the possibility of landing, lack of light signals or road signs.
“We often think we’re alone on the cross, and we really hurt the lives of other drivers,” said a few days ago Marek Ustrobiński, the city’s vice president.
His words broke out at the press conference of the ratus, on which the city authorities presented examples of the inappropriate movement of cars on the crossroads, which resulted in the creation of curves.
At the time, the president urged the travellers to have reason on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to write SMSs during driving.
The topic was somehow taken over by the Rashov police, who are starting the “Transitional Crossing” action from today.
What is it about?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of the limitation of crossroads by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent infringement that contributes to the strengthening of traffic difficulties and the formation of corks.
He is threatened with a mandate of 300 PLN and two punishments.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to the lack of light signals or road signs and irregular parking in the crossroads area.
They will also observe a lack of driving liquidity, late movement below the signals, free crossroads and leaving too large distances between the vehicles.
What crossroads will be carried out?
M.in. on ul. Lisa-Kuli from ul. Jagiellońska; al. Ciepliński from al. Piłsudski; ul. Targowej from al. Piłsudski; Placu Sreniawitów from ul. Dąbrowski or ul. Hetmańskiej from al. Rebels of Warsaw.
This type of action in the capital Podkarpacia will be held on the next Friday of October.
They checked the company that was removing waste from “Czajki”
“The officers of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Municipality of Volomynsk and the Municipal Inspection of Construction Inspection checked on Friday the facility in the village of Zelonka, where waste from the cleaning facility “Czajka” in Warsaw is eliminated,” said Volomynsk mayor’s spokesman Karol Szyszko.
Inspectors from the mayor of Volomini have carried out controls in the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zelonka.
The Private Trade and Transport Factory “Dar-Trans”, under the contract with the “Czajka” table waste cleaning facility, performs waste management services.
“The inspection of the facility was done, the entrepreneur was also asked to provide the documentation related to the activity he carried out,” said Shyszko.
He added that the inspection report will be submitted, among other things, to the Wojewódzkij Inspektoratu Ochrony Umwelt in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Transie” was carried out by the Wojewódzkij Inspektorat Ochrany Środowiska w Warszawie in the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out samples, measurements and subterranean waters research, and also did not have the results of the research of stable communal waste settlements from the "Czajka" waste cleaner.
After the control of WIOŚ, Darius Sobota was called to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Private Trade and Transport Factory “DAR-TRANS” Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stable municipal waste plants from the cleaning facility “Czajka”.
According to the decision to carry out the elimination of waste in the field of production, in the forests around Greenland is processed waste of a mass of up to 60,000 tons per year.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sanitation Company last Thursday that in the breakdown of November and December 2018 the STUOŠ was disabled from operation, which was associated with damage to one of the combustion equipment.
The monthly cost of their export is 1.7 million PLN (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Walesa supported the Kidawa-Blansk Maghreb.
“You’ve taken a difficult task, you can count on my complete support,” said Lech Wałęsa to Kidawa-Blonna Maghreb on Friday.
“Mr. President, for me this is a very important word,” said the candidate for Prime Minister of the Civil Coalition, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now “only a puppy on retirement.”
Małgorzata Kidawa-Blanska met on Friday with former President Lech Wałęsa at his office in the Gdansk European Solidarity Centre.
In the short conversation behind the closed doors participated also the son of Walesa – Jaroslav.
“You’ve taken a difficult task,” said Lech Wallace after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
The problems with Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, there is a great hope that you as a woman will deal with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible,” the former president said, addressing Kidawa-Blonna.
very important words
Kidawa-Blanka thanked for support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and knows what it is important,” she said.
Let us show that we can do a different, wise policy, together, but according to the Constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
“The Lord did his revolution so, and we want to change Poland so,” Kidawa-Blanska said.
Kibic in retirement
In a conversation with journalists, Wallace said he is now “only a pensioner.”
“Of course I look at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, (to this) we will return.
The triangle of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessarily necessary.
And that’s all we need to clean up, that’s all we need to restore to normal work and I believe that this time we’re doing it.
For if not, then a street criterion awaits us,” said Lech Wałęsa.
“Therefore it is so important that the Poles go to the elections, think and make a decision on their own.
And that’s the most important thing,” Kidawa-Blanka said.
“The last chance is that the card will improve the state of things in Poland,” the former president replied.
“We need to rebuild the foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes for her which should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Blonskaya said: “Mr. President said very well.
We need to rebuild a foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no triangle of power, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and lead to the fact that this becomes obvious and that everyone knows that otherwise Poland will not move a step forward.”
Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot ground in Lublan, the Polish networks struggled with the Slovenia in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the main role.
The White and Red have defeated 1:3 and won a red medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws.
The Senate adopted without amendments the law on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important state officials and on the lots of the most important persons in the state.
For the amendment of the law on the property of the families of state officials – without amendments – voted 52 senators, 14 were against, three refused to vote.
Thus, the Senators decided to reject 12 amendments, submitted during the Wednesday debate by Senator Sławomir Rybickiego.
According to him, the amendments had the law to “civilize” and limit the scope of the information provided in the declaration on the property situation of the own children, the children of the spouse, the children qualified for cases in which the children remain in the common household with the person obliged to submit the declaration.
The law on the publicity of the property of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was formed in the office of the Prime Minister, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The legislation presupposes that, among others, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members, Members of the Parliament, Senators, Presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as the persons headed by other state institutions, will be obliged to place in the property declaration information about the personal property of spouses, children and persons who remain in common interest.
The Senate has not proposed an amendment to the law on the lot of the most important people in the country.
It regulates which flights have the HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the country.
The law also specifies who is responsible for carrying out the Central Register of Flights.
55 Senators voted for the law, 12 were against, four refused to vote.
According to the law, every president’s flight will be a flight “which is carried out in an official mission.”
The President will be able to accompany the members of the family and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be a flight “received to carry out tasks directly related to the fulfilled function”.
The law also specifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
Members of the delegations may be on board – invited members, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational assistance; and journalists.
In accordance with the law, in the event of any doubts relating to the flights of the Sejm and Senate marshals, the head of the KPRM will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not explained within the time specified, the head of the CPRM will be obliged to notify the head of the office of the Sejm or the Senate of the lack of the possibility of organizing such a flight.

The Polish players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play a match for a brown medal on Saturday.
Vitala Heinen's way to win the title was closed by a quarterly defeat with the Slovenia 1:3 in Lublan.
It was loud about their trouble with the journey to this match.
This time, there was no such problem – on Friday afternoon, they went to Paris with the Slovenians on a charter, and a few hours later they took training in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the relationships of the people present at the classes, the world champions' trainer was undernerved.
As Heynen’s assistant Michael Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not exercising the net element itself.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending it more together than training.
Talk, think about how to restore everything as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two opinions, we are disappointed.
We thought we would be back to this match.
We discussed this match between each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure I would indicate inefficiency in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with the situation balls.
In this regard, the Slovenia were much better than us,” he analyzed.
According to him, the “White and Red” did not prevent the stress associated with the performance against the supported by a loud and numerous audience to the co-hosts of the tournament.
He acknowledged that the world champions could slightly slow the way to the semi-finals.
“Maybe if we had a failure in the group stage in a similar style, it would be faster for us to analyze this lesson and later otherwise we would play in the next stage of the tournament.
But it’s just a crack,” he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat to the Poles will succeed in turning into aggression in a brune match.
“I hope we will show our true face.
There is something to fight.
We won the medal last time in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, in the first two matches of the group phase they went to Apeldoorn, and in the semi-finals they moved to Lublana.
Nick Kyrgios: Strong punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player was sentenced to a 16-week start prohibition and a fine of $25,000 – in a half-year suspension – for sudden words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour players lose patience to Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the performances of the most uncrossed professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus a lot of fine, but both punishments are suspended for a half year – a trial period in which the crazy athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been breaking for a long time and has reached a special tennis record in the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline single financial punishment for breaking the rules of behavior on and next to him.
Loud curse, strange gestures, non-sport behavior, injury to the judge and the audience, breaking two missiles during the lost match with Karen Chachanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
In the US Open 2019, he also didn’t play a long time, but he managed to say publicly that ATP activists were “corrupted,” which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they conducted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks submitted the aforementioned confirmation of suspension of starts and a further penalty.
The words of corruption, however, were forgiven after he heard the accused and knew the context of his speech.
In the justification, however, the tennis actors said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behavior over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious reservations and constituted a almost continuous violation of the rules that he uninterruptedly vulgarly offended the people involved in the tournaments and the spectators, therefore a high punishment.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately delayed the execution of the judgment, ordering to meet several conditions within the next six months: at the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the current code of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular, no longer can be cursed, destroyed, disputed with judges and the public, or any other way to behave unfairly and vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek “tough support” from the mental coaches during the tournaments and also outside the season consulted with people specializing in solving the problems of athletes who did not deal with proper behavior.
The first comment (in social media) of Nick Kyrgios to the post was: “Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, because in the Laver Cup he has worsened the crash of the boat, so he had to give up the nearest starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
ATP Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than $1.3 million, so even after penalties he will have a lot left.
Poland is getting better
According to a report published on Friday by GUS on household budgets, 44% of them assessed their material situation as good or rather good.
A year earlier this percentage was 37.2 percent, in 2016 33,5 percent, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30 percent.
In total, 8.1 percent of households considered their material situation bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2 percent a year earlier and more than 20 percent in 2009.
The best is the material situation of household households of people working on their own account.
More than 70 percent of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the second edge are household farms of rencists, where the percentage of such answers was only 18%.
The number of children has a great impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is the parents who alone raise descendants, of whom 32 percent declare good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 per cent, and among non-born households it is 48.8 per cent.
In these statistics, the result of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Prior to its launch (in 2016) their worst material situation was assessed by parents who alone raised descendants and multi-born families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessments of the material situation of the Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all because the percentage of households that consider their situation good, increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of the provinces there is no clear dependence between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best ratings are formulated by the inhabitants of the province of Opolis, where their situation is good or rather good is considered by 48.9 percent of the surveyed.
The following provinces are Lubus (47.7 per cent), Slez (47.6 per cent), Mazowic (47.3 per cent) and Western Morocco (47.1 per cent).
Meanwhile, the regulatory income (i.e. after the payment of taxes and contributions) was less than 94 per cent of the national average in August and 98 per cent in Lubus.
The highest income was the inhabitants of Mazowieck (120 percent of the national average) and Silesian (104 percent).
On average in Poland, the regulatory income per person was 1693 zlotys in 2018.
In real terms (after the price change impact correction) it increased by 4.3 percent compared to 2017.
On the background of the previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, the per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
Although the rise of income frees, it also hinderes the rise of expenditure.
These in conversion per person amounted to 1187 PLN, which means that in real perception they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such incident since 2013.
In 2017, the per-person expenditure increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Studies on household budgets suggest that statistical households currently spend 70.1 percent of their regulatory income, while in 2014 the share exceeded 80 percent and in 2006 it exceeded 90 percent.

U.S.: Three suicides among aircraft crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on the USS ship George H. W. Bush, the U.S. Navy said.
Over the past two years, five crew members have been killed.
The previous suicide occurred in July of this year, and earlier in November of 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of the events occurred in the land when the USS George H. W. Bush collapsed near the coast of the state of Virginia.
Third persons have been excluded.
Death is not connected to each other.
“We need everyone to engage in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigmatisation or other repercussions related to seeking help,” said on Facebook Captain Sean Bailey, commander of the ship.
He criticized the pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In a conversation with Peter Lekszyck Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for the opposition activists.
“Every opinion was accepted.”
The criticism of some of his actions appeared later.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eradicate the harmful activity of Rydzik is a great shade on his pontification.
But this redemptorist – the harmful of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best even during the life of the Pope Polak,” he explained.
A former PO politician acknowledged: “There were storms of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, once Rydzik did not accept, but he had power, and for political purposes he could simply be throwed out of the Church or sent to a mission to New Caledonia or to Fiji to collect money for the poor there.
However, John Paul II did not do so, as his successors did,” Niesilovsky explained.
“In addition, this fatal case of pedophilia and the Church’s actions, and in fact their lack, has come.
I went a little forward thinking, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole form of his life.
The scale of pedophilia in the Church has been known from relatively recent time.
The question arises, how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these ugly affairs,” he said in a conversation with the journalist Niesilovsky.
According to the former Polish politician, the Church is an ally of the PiS.
“We must acknowledge that in the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All ceremonies began with the Holy Mass, and everywhere the cross was hanged.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the greatest unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzik tremble the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay an elephant,” Niesilovsky convinced.
“I hope that Pope Francis will drive Yizrashevsky, Rydzik and a few more of this kind,” he said.
Tomorrow is the 590th anniversary
There will be concerts and auctions.
The festival will be held in the House of Culture.
At 10 a.m. in the church of St. Nicholas will begin the Mass.
The official opening ceremony will take place at 11:30 p.m. in HDK.
There will be a group of singers and dances.
The young man of I LO named Stanislava Staszica will present the spectacle “Powiat hrubieszowski: From there my family – here I live.”
They will then be awarded the medals "Dedicted for the Grubysovsky district".
At 16 a.m. the event will be moved to the city deptak, where the concerts “Hrubieszów charitativnie dla Angeliki Zińkiewicz” will be held.
They will play disco polo teams – NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and Night Star Mig.
There will be an auction, including a pear and a porcelan of the President of the Council of Ministers.
The PZPN punishes for the burds in the stadiums.
Disqualified Gryf
The strike in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherovo and Lechia Gdańsk with small hair did not end tragically, when a millimeters shot off by the fighters of Wejherova was passed by the opponent team's goalkeeper, Zlatana Alomerovic.
After this incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission that investigates the case has sentenced Gryf a severe penalty, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
They will not be allowed in the next match at their own stadium.
They will not be able to go to the league tournaments until December 31.
The burds at the Widzeva Lodž stadium also sparked the Slezska Wrocław.
Here, however, the judgment of the PZPN was milder, because Slezsk predicted that similar events could occur and felt the appropriate authorities in this matter.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the boat cyber sector to be rejected by races, the burning of chairs and the dismantling of the host sector.
The match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water armor.
PZPN punished Slezsk with a single-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned organizing departure to the match in this and the next edition of the PP.
The exit ban also covered the Extraklasy league matches, but it will last until 31 December.
The names of foreign cities on road labels also in Poland
GDDKiA plans to exchange labels on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacia, the implementation of the amendment of the Ministry of Infrastructure Regulation on, among other things, the registration of the names of foreign cities on road labels also in Poland began.
“The Lion” will appear next to “L’viv”.
In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road marks set at the A4 highway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it will be easier, more readable and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Infrastructure Minister's Regulation on detailed technical conditions for road signals and road safety equipment.
“We should remember that the names of towns in neighboring countries often have Polish sound as well.
Thanks to the changes we have prepared in the law, they will eventually appear on the road boards on our roads.
The introduction of a new label will begin with the subcarpage section of the A4 highway,” Infrastructure Minister Andrzej Adamczyk said.
The changes will be made on the 94 road marks set at the A4 highway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
200 thousand pounds.
First of all, the new label will be implemented on the A4 highway, which is scheduled for 1 November 2019.
How will the idea be implemented?
It will take place without exchange of tables, on the basis of the insert.
They will replace the current localities names with the new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be recorded in one line – first in Polish, and then in the original, in the line.
This will be a great facility for people who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Razer has announced the Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One – the world’s first Xbox One headset powered by haptic technology.
HyperSense provides immersion in games and provides better control over the environment.
The Razer HyperSense uses haptic solutions developed by Lofelt, a German company specializing in developing advanced haptic technologies that provide realistic touch-based impressions.
HyperSense uses special haptic drivers and intelligent digital signal processing to generate high-resolution touch-back connectivity in real-time, allowing you to be fully immersed in any Xbox One game.
The technology recognizes sound signals and turns them into dynamic vibrations so that players can feel the game without having to install additional software.
Thanks to the use of touch senses, sound signals can accurately track the actions in the game.
The HyperSense Razer speaks the events – from quiet steps to powerful explosions, accurately reporting all the activities in the player’s environment.
“Nari Ultimate for Xbox One has been designed to provide all players with an additional game size.
With HyperSense, we allow them to be completely immersed in their favourite titles,” said Alvin Cheung Senior Vice President for Razer Peripheral Devices.
The rotating switches are equipped with a pen filled with a memory of shape and a layer of cooling gel, to limit the heat generated during long use.
To make the headsets even easier to operate, a fast-press button is placed on the exhausted microphone, and on the headset a HyperSense intensity regulator and a soft balance between game and chat.
The self-adjusting to the head shape of the palm provides a problem-free and accurate adjustment.
Furthermore, Razer Nari Ultimate for Xbox One has the Xbox Wireless feature that allows direct connection to the console without the need to use the wireless transmission and receiver device, allowing easy and fast configuration.
The headset also supports the Windows Sonic system, which provides more realistic sound.
The Razer Nari Ultimate, originally designed for PCs, was launched in September 2018.
With Nari Ultimate for Xbox One, Razer can now offer this award-winning technology to Xbox One fans.
The set was valued at 219.99 euros.
A man shot a windroom.
In the castle in the Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a thief having problems with the wings.
After the detection and the visit to the veterinarian, it was revealed that someone had set himself a target from the animal – in his body was found a straw from the windroom.
“Information about the wounded bird has been received from the residents of the village of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Nova Soli.
It was that the animal had broken wings.
We got to place.
Soon it was clear that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately so that we didn’t hurt him and not exposed to extra stress.
It was removed and brought to the veterinarian.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was known that someone made it a shooter.
In his body there were fractures,” says Marcin Walasek, chairman of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation center.
He is in the center.
“The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, water was provided, a safe place in the centre, where he will spend the whole winter.
We try to strengthen it.
He is not yet able to fly.
The release of him now would be associated with the fact that he probably’t survive the winter,” says Walasek.
The staff, after submitting the rehabilitation lobby, intends to let him go to the same joint in the spring.
After receiving information about the cause of the animal's poor health, the authorities of the municipality of Zhukovice intend to inform the prosecutor's office of the case.
The incident occurred in the closet.
Gowin: “We need to stimulate Polish, small trade”
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments allowing to stimulate Polish trade,” said Vice-President, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.
Gowin, in a conversation in the "Signals of the Day" on the radio Unit, stated that trade is controlled by international networks that impose Polish producers such low marges that Polish companies cannot develop.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to tackle, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but received "control from the EU".
“We’ve won before the court and I hope that if the United Law wins the next elections and forms a government, we’ll go back to that issue,” he said.
He also pointed out that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish and thus small trade.”
“Fore this, we will need to consider whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the EU court ruled that the European Commission made a mistake considering Poland’s retail tax was unauthorized public aid.
The Retail Tax Act provided for the introduction of two trade taxes: 0.8% of the income between 17 million PLN and 170 million PLN per month and 1.4% of the income above 170 million PLN per month.
The tax was due to be in force since September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission launched a trial for Poland’s breach of EU law.
Brussels then argued that tax construction could prefer smaller stores, which could be considered public aid.
She later stated that the Danina was implemented in an unlawful way.
It also issued an order to suspend the tax application until the examination was completed by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The judgment of the EU court opened the way to reintroducing the tax, but it did not end the case.
On July 24, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSUE press services told PAP that the matter is currently in a written phase, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known if and when the oral procedure will begin, i.e. the hearing of the parties and the possible trial.
It takes good several to a few months from the appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
“This process lasts an average year,” PAP said a source at the Luxembourg Court.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer some practical solutions.
The baptism is an important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first time the whole family focuses around the child, together celebrating his appearance in the world.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the newly blessed mom and dad want their comfort to look as good as possible on that day.
However, before you make a final decision about the baby’s costume, think about whether it will also be comfortable.
In the stores you can find a lot of machinery sets that do not provide the child with adequate comfort.
What should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for the choice of clothes for baptism is the age of the child.
Until recently, a few-week little boy was baptized, arranged in white sets and placed in the same bits or large shoulder.
Today, the children coming to the sacrament are often older: a few months old, a year old, and even older.
It’s hard to guess that such a great comfort requires a little different clothes for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3 to 4 months old on the day of the baptism, it is likely that the celebration will be held in a wheelchair or in the hands of parents or baptists.
The best way to do this will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeps or completes.
Although this element of the closet is considered to be a daily dress, it’s enough to look for its dedicated variants, for example, with a falbank or a crown.
For the boy the ideal will be the body with the press of the mouse and the steel.
For older children, you can afford more fantasy in the clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tiuled dress.
Many parents of the girl with fatigue look toward richly decorated, folded clothes for baptism in a set of plates, clothes and hates.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers for their product use artificial, undeathing materials, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant clothes on cotton coats.
Delicate, tiul footwear, satin clothes, crowns, applications and charming sets will make your daughter look superb and feel comfortable.
Ideal clothes for a little gentleman: cotton garniture
Until recently, among the parents of boys dominated fashion on garnitures that are a copy of “adult” models.
Polyester marines and pants, rigid coats and caskets often made young elegants to demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been washed out by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, dressed pants, and for this the bluz is decorated from the front to the shape of a shell.
These machines look incredibly consecrated, and at the same time do not ruin the movements of the world of the little one.
Christina Pawłowicz has published a property statement
Christina Pavlovic has filed an asset declaration at the end of the term.
According to the report, the company has collected 110,000 euros of savings.
Paulovich has announced his resignation from politics.
At the end of his term, he has a total of 110,000.
According to the report, she receives a monthly pension of €4.7 million.
Pawłowicz has a apartment worth 570 thousand yuan and a bit smaller, which he rents, taking 880 yuan a month.
The commission also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment to 150,000 PLN.
The property declaration was previously published by Jarosław Kaczyński.
Voting on a break at the Conference of the Conservative Party
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons at the annual Programme Conference of the Conservative Party, which the government requested.
There were 289 votes for, 306 against.
Usually, the House of Commons does not work during party conferences, so that the members do not have to resign either by participating in them or by parliamentary sessions.
However, the opposition parties considered that in such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK’s scheduled out of the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the agenda.
There were 289 votes for the government’s proposal, 306 against.
Two opposition parties have signed conventions
The lack of consent to the break can be recognised as a political revenge of the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend the parliament for five weeks (this decision was on Tuesday recognized by the Supreme Court as unlawful and unlawful) and for the fact that after the judges' judgment he did not want to apologize for it.
After this decision, the Gmin Chamber resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the following burstful debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It’s time to implement the Brexit.
It needs to be done in order to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit has to come so that we can deal on citizens’ priorities, healthcare, and cost of life.
Brexit must be realised in order to unite the country,” Johnson said.
The Conference of the Conservative Party is scheduled to start in Manchester on Sunday and last until Wednesday, October 2.
The two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already been meeting.
One of the grounds that Johnson made to explain the long suspension of Parliament was the party conferences.
Andrzej Duda accuses Israel of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” foreign media wrote.
The president’s spokesman strongly denounced the reports.
“It’s just wrong,” he wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, such as “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, referring to “Jewish Insider”, write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the RP consulate in New York declared that it is Israel who is guilty of the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The President said the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Katz, who said in February that “Polish people raised anti-Semitism with mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the offensive statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against Polish ambassador to Israel Mark Magierovsky.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who cried, “Polak, Polak.”
“The quote is not just incorrect.
That’s just wrong,” he wrote on Twitter.
“Duda has never said that Israel is responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spychalski portal, “this was invented.”
According to the talks of the “JI” during the meeting there was also a dispute between the survivor of the Holocaust, awarded by the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Macedonia Edward Mosberg and Rabin Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg had to agree with President Duda’s words and say that the Jews from Israel “taking like Israel Kac” are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the Boteach portal, Mosberg's speech had to be interrupted.
Who is Bananas and what is he guilty?
The stone rented by the suteners led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Mariana Banasia.
We summarize another incident that shocked the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Supervisor” journalists have revealed that Marian Banaś, the chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered the property declaration of the 400-metre stone that is located in the Krakow suburb over the past few years.
Moreover, his rental manager was in the mentioned sexbiznes stone (and thus rent rooms for hours).
The building itself, on the other hand, has been assured since 2016 to refund the loan.
Bertold Kittel’s “Supervisor” show.
The journalist revealed that the stone was rented from Banasia by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotic meetings.”
Customers should be men who use prostitute services.
Banas responded unclearly and gently to the accusations.
Interestingly, the stone rented by the suteners led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's asset statements.
For the stone itself was unclearly described in them, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.
“The property of Mariana Banasia and his wife can be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can praise themselves with two houses, three apartments, savings[...]”, writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the stone itself of Banasia was already worth about 3 million zlotys.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office currently controls Marian Banasia’s asset statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banas announced that until its completion it will suspend its activity in the NIK. “I will go to you marshals for free holidays,” he said.
The opposition requires clarification.
“We don’t hear that the CBA extends its investigation or accelerates the investigation of Marian Banasia’s asset statements.
Therefore, we are forced to withdraw state authorities and make a notification of the possibility of committing a crime,” said deputy PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Polish so harshly lowly valued the rental of his property, he would already have 10 controls, tax scope and criminal proceedings,” he added.
He sat high, fell low.
Marian Banas is the new chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed on August 30, 2019 for a six-year term.
His candidacy was announced by Law and Justice and by the votes of the political parties accepted.
Previously Banas was associated with the NIK between 1992 and 2005, he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczynski.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008) Banas was the chairman of the Customs Service, and also the sub-secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015 he has again been head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Customs Administration.

Police: Ignoring the police order will be punished
According to the newspaper, the denial of the order of a certain behavior issued by a police officer is to be a new kind of offence, threatened by fines, arrest or restriction of freedom.
This change is required by the police officers.
The idea came to the Seim Commission for Petitions.
“The case is serious, because now every year more than half a million offences are brought to the Polish courts,” we read.
The “Rzeczpospolita” found that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Police writes to the members on the change of the code of violations has a chance to succeed.
The authors of the petition propose a new sentence of Article 54a of the infringement code.
“Whoever does not submit to the request or order of a public officer, issued within the borders and on the basis of the law, shall be punished with arrest, fines or freedom restrictions.”
“Paragraph 3 of this provision states the same punishment for those who, by failing to comply with the instructions, will prevent or make it difficult to perform a service activity,” the newspaper reports.
The sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told the "Rzeczpospolitej" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in political matters of demonstrations.
“In the situations of freedom demonstrations it would be bad and instead of relieving the situation, it would even aggravate it,” he adds.
The newspaper’s statistics show that 86 percent of citizens positively assessed the police interventions in 2018 and that every month the service takes 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is concerned about Europe.
Yachim Topol has writing in blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important follow-up Czech dramatists, now mentioned in one sequence with Václav Havel.
Therefore, from the beginning, the curse of the talent that he tries to use was put on Yachim.
After eight years, he returned with a sensitive man.
The heroes are Buras and Soňa along with two sons who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are famous actors, traveling around Europe.
He is Shakespeare's lover and the thief, she's a single-looking translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys since birth did not give out a sound, and for the second time he stopped in childhood.
But not the heroes are the most important in this story.
Everyone is just a background to observe a world in which there is no more space for artists.
It is a world of a flooded province, a society of old people, suspicious people, and dissolved youth.
“The sensitive man” places becomes an absurd theater.
The narrative follows didascalia, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is Europe full of concerns about its future, but also of constant questions about the past.
Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although the British travel office Thomas Cook has collapsed, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is operating.
The company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.
Neckermann also dismissed 75 employees.
All departies with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but temporaries will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Gandawa also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are residing abroad on a trip purchased by Thomas Cook.
More than 40,000 people had to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokesman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said the company is currently “fullly operating” despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British mother company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then calmed that the customers who bought the trips in it will go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world, announced its bankruptcy on Sunday to Monday night.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the breakdown on Sunday's last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to an agreed backup plan of £900 million in August, the company earned an additional £200 million as a warranty for the winter period when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have grown over a few years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for review
Free accommodation in exchange for a review – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the German resident Görlitz.
The action is aimed at combating the decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the most eastern town of Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to the Guardian, the city is facing significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a constant decline in the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, which resulted in a 25% decrease in the city’s population.
In 2013 it reached 54 thousand people.
To fight depopulation, officials came into the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
150 applications have been submitted.
Two-thirds of them were inhabitants of large cities.
The program also attended persons from Hungary, Czech Republic, the United States and the UK.
“When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter if we’re here for four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has seven thousand free housing, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the country.
Although the city authorities are hoping that some will take place permanently, the main objective of the program is to get the opinion of the program participants.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said program manager Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to encourage new inhabitants, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first of them was Detroit, which introduced a remuneration program to promising young professionals for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candelia in Italy, or in the American Tulsia in Oklahoma.
