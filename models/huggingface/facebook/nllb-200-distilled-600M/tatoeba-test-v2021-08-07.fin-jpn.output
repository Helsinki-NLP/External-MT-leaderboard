Yesterday night, my mom was up late.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing.
Nothing was seen.
I don't think that country needs any help.
I don't think we're in the mood to go to the movies.

I'm glad I'm not the one paying.
I'm glad I have a great library.
Good luck!
Thank God I can use a very good library.
The news of the accident came as a terrible shock to me.
I'm lucky I got an accident. We took the full backup the day before.
Can I get a share?
Congratulations to you!
There are seedless grapes and seedless watermelons, but are there seedless mangoes?
Never seen a real cow before.
It's strange that he came home so late last night.

That's funny.

That's interesting.
I'm glad you found your girlfriend.
I'm glad you have good friends.
That's funny, right?
How beautiful the moon is.
What a great idea!
It's been a long week.
That's weird.
It's better you don't tell Tom about it.
It's better to starve than to steal.
A long time ago!
A long time ago!
A long time ago!
You have a lovely necklace.
It's cold.
How beautiful your skin is
This is a nice coat. Can I make this up?
I'm having a nice day.
It's really cold today, isn't it?
This is stupid.
What a wonderful idea!
There's still a long way to go.
That's fun.
Of course, he's not guilty.

Snow has been falling for days.
It's in your best interest to study now.
It is a great honor to have the King visit our city.

That's not my ticket.
This is no pride.
I don't think that's weird.
That's none of your business.
That's none of your business.
That's not fair.
It's not your fault, Tom, so don't worry about it.
That's not necessary.

The villa is only a five minute walk from the beach.
That's a very attractive idea.
Stand up straight and relax your shoulders.

The handbag thief tried to get rid of my grip on the grin and the twisted leaves.
The author translated these grains into our mother tongue.
The book is easy.

There's no such thing as a person who's too old to study.
I'll take care of it.
I'm next door, so if you get a promise, just let me know.

The man was sentenced to life.
What surprised me most in that accident was how quickly the lawyers recorded the scene.
What I like about Mary is her strength.
What surprised me the most when I first started at university was how few of my classmates knew effective learning techniques.
What he told us recently was totally meaningless.
What he told us recently was totally meaningless.
What he said must be true.
What I am today is your business.
What you lack is tenacity!
The woman talks just like a teacher.
It looks like an apple.
After reading something good, don't write anything, don't say anything, don't dare to spoil that beautiful charm with your shameless dirty words.
After I got homework done, I talked to my mom.
Tom solved the puzzle after getting some clues from Mary.

That's why I want to talk to Tom.
That was the first time Tom saw the Golden Gate Bridge.
It was fun.
It was a fun dinner tour, notwithstanding the weather.
It was a fun breakfast with everything else except the weather.
It was made by hand.
It was handmade.
It was fun.
It was a total heap to me.
It was my only option.
It was addressed to Tom and Mary.
It was one of the most important breakthroughs in science.
It was really cheap.
It was really hard.
It was really hard.
It was just a joke.
It was just a joke.
That's just his way.

That's the dumbest thing I've ever said.
It's new.
It's dangerous!
They're a wealthy family.

That hotel is run by his uncle.
He's a little out of business with women, so you better keep your eye on him.
That cat's pretty fat.
The critic always says things briefly and in a very basic way.
That kid is mean to me.
The toy is made of wood.

There's a cat on the chair.
The man standing there is the owner of the store.

That dress suits you well.
That black is mine.

That doll is scary.
That's too small.
That's poison.
That's broken.
I'm sure that shirt will suit you well.
That patient won't last the summer.

Yeah, well, somehow I get a little sick watching the sun go down.
There's one thing I'd like to ask you.
Can I ask you something?
That girl looks really cute.
Smoking makes your lungs mess up.
Kissing a smoker is like licking a ashtray.

The wind is down.
The wind knocked down a tree.
The wind is calm.
The wind is stronger.
The wind was so strong, the windows were ringing.
The wind is blowing from the west.
The wind is blowing from the north.
The wind is blowing.
The wind stopped.
I think the wind's up.
Come here, I wanna show you something.

Like it or not, you gotta do it.
It's boring!
Push it open.
Work has become increasingly difficult.
The girl's face lit up when she heard the boy's words.
When my daughter was little, she had asthma attacks.

My daughter is sleeping bad.
You'd better ask the girls about girls.
The girl who likes me is right there.
You're threatening me?
You're threatening me?
Uighur is one of the Turkish languages.
Foreigners have a hard time getting used to Japanese food.

The news that the earthquake occurred was later proven true.
News of the accident was a terrible shock to me.
News of the accident was a terrible shock to me.
Election Day was rainy and cold.
But there's a big dog.
A little fun.
We exchanged our eyes.
Even if you don't want to, you have to.
No matter how busy he is, he'll probably be here.
Though her face is very swollen, she says she doesn't have swine fever.
Although he promised to pay me this week, he never did.
Even at 50, she's still breathtakingly beautiful.
Though they were tired, they did not stop working.

Though men may seem to be very good, they are all wolves.
I'm broke, but I accidentally bought another book.
Although I have a pee tomorrow, I went to drink a lot of orange juice.

Even though I only have a small amount of money, you let me donate it all.
Though she tried to please him, he was not.
Although I studied English for six years in school, I don't speak it well.
Even if I make a mistake, I'll try again.
Even if you don't have an appetite, you'll have to eat something or you won't last till lunch.
Even if Tom asks you something, you can't answer.
Although Tom is ill, he plans to finish his homework on time.
Even if you complain, it's not worth it.
Although an old building with its high-rise and imposing rooms may not be as practical as a colorless office complex to replace it, it often fits in better with its surroundings.
Even if I tried to play professional baseball, I don't think I would have any luck.
Even if you try your best, you won't succeed so easily.
Seems a little bit of a hoot.
Seems interesting!
I think we should talk outside.
