Welsh AMs are concerned about 'smelling of mepet'
Some AAMs have expressed concern over the idea that their name should be MWP (Welsh Members of Parliament).
The case arose as a result of a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh Parliament.
A.M.s in the political world are worried that it could be a joke.
A Labour A.M. said he feared his group would "confront the TWP and the PWP".
For readers outside of wales, the wales TWP means fool and the pWP means scumbag.
According to one Played AM, the group is "not happy" overall and has suggested options.
A Welsh activist said his group had a "acceptable mind" about the name change, but it was a brief word jump from the MWP to the MEPET.
In this context, the Welsh alphabet W is the same as the English U in Yorkshire.
The current legislative committee, which is drafting legislation to introduce similar changes, said: "The final decision on any commentary on what members of the council are to be called is, of course, up to the members".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 authorised the name change to the Welsh Assembly.
In June, the Council published the results of a public consultation with broad support for a proposal to call the summit the Welsh Parliament.
In the name of the AMs, the Commission chose Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option was overwhelmingly supported by public consultation.
AMs are clearly offering alternatives, but for the current chairman, Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit the bill within weeks, reaching an agreement could be a headache.
The amendments include the rules on the dismissal of AMs and the drafting of the Committee's system, including other changes to the way the Assembly works.
when the AMs argue against the law, they get the final vote on the question of who should be called:
Macedonians voted to change the name of their country in a referendum
Sunday voters will choose to name their country the Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was held to resolve decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own state called Macedonia.
Athens has long denied her repeated bid to become a member of the EU and NATO, suggesting that the name of her northern neighbor suggests a claim on her state.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the name change, said he would not pay attention to the election.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say the name change is an easy fee to become a member of the EU and NATO.
During the struggle of the churches in Harlem, the bells of St. Martin were silently rung
"The elders I have met in history were a café and a church in every corner", said mr. adam.
"There are none today".
he explained that the destruction of coffee houses is understandable.
"People are now socializing differently", he said.
"Coffee houses are now the most frequented local living room houses".
The money from the sale of property belonging to the churches is feared by leaders to be too little, "and it is where it started sooner or later".
They added that churches could replace the rest of the shrines with apartment buildings full of public houses with people who do not understand the local people.
"Most people who buy condominiums in this area will be white", he explained, "and so these churches will speed up the closing of the day because most people who come to these condominiums are not expected to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congresses before Harlem became a black convent: the city community, St. Martin, in 1870, a decade later.
The main white methodist conference took place in the 1930s.
The recent Black Congress seized ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a strike on merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who had organized the Black Congress to hire or raise blacks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when Fazer Johnson planned to rebuild the tower, they made it with a silent musical instrument.
Father David Johnson, son of Fazer Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly called the instrument "the cry of the poor".
Experts who played the instrument last July called it something else: "cultural resource" and irreplaceable "historical instrument".
The first ever instrument in the world was played by Tiffany N.G., a University of Michigan scholar, and by Dioncio A. Lind, a black musician who moved to the large orchestra of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
St. Martin did not replace him, according to mr. Meriwether.
The events that have taken place in St. Martin over the past few months are the story of complex architects and contractors, some by church leaders and others by the parish bishop.
The Property Board - a governing body founded by church leaders - wrote in July that although the Property was not involved in the process of hiring architects and contractors sent by the parish, the parish "wants to spend the expenses on the Property".
Some Muslims complain about the privacy problems in the parish.
A 13-year-old boy who was swimming to catch lobsters in California was permanently injured
Authorities said a 13-year-old boy who swam to catch a fish-borne lobster was shot and wounded during a lobster opening in California on Saturday.
The damage occurred just before 7 a.m. near the coast of Insinitas, Bacon.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that they had been swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when they heard the boy cry out for help and rushed to the boy with the group to get him out of the water.
Hamel initially thought it was fun to catch lobsters, but he said, "They understood that you were screaming 'I'm touched!' "
'I have touched you!'
The whole book was opened, and hamel said they noticed this as soon as they arrived with his son.
"I called out to all the people to get out of the water, 'There is a shake in the water!'" Hamel added.
The boy was flown from the Raddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was placed on the list of dangerous.
The species of fish that caused the accident is unknown.
According to media reports, lifeguard Katen Larry Giles, a fish spider was spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but was not considered a dangerous species of fish spider.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed the beach for 48 hours for inspection and security purposes from Ponto Beach to Swamis in Insinitas, Casablanca.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of fish in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sensbury's plans to enter the UK beauty markets
With the professional support of craftsmen from Sensbury, the large store, organized into boots, superboxes and different parts of the Debenhams, has stylish beauty shelves.
As fashion and domestic sales continue to decline, as part of a £2.8 billion push to the UK market, the biggest beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The supermarket, which has invested in beauty, came at a time when it was saving the space for the shelves once used for TVs, heaters and furniture.
Sentsbury said it will double its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, EC, Twitterman and Dr. For the first time.
Starting with L'Oreal, Mabelyn and Burts Bees, the current products will have branded superior locations similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-launched the size of its boutique make-up to create products that are suitable for vegetarians only, which are highly sought after by most young consumers.
Fragrance, a fragrance retailer, is also trying out a discount at two Sensbury stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Sealy Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
If online shopping and small amounts of food are convenient every day, buying locally means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Sentsbury's CEO, Mike Coupé, said that in an attempt to cheat Aldi and Lidl, who have more discounts and services and non-food products, the retail locations of the supermarket chain appear to be a large, highly organized department store.
Sensbury has set up hundreds of stores with Argon Outlets and has been strengthening grocery sales since buying both chains two years ago and has introduced several homes that have made its holdings more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate it into a large store with beauty and pharmacies in different sections has failed.
Sensbury had tried to start with Boots in the early 2000s, but ended up with a dispute over how to divide the revenue from the grocery stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sensabury 281 sold the pharmacy to Celcio, owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
According to Lloyd, it will play a role in the plan, expanding luxury skincare brands to four stores, including products such as Laroche-Posaie and Vinci.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director at Sensbury, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in partners who are specially trained and willing to advise.
The brands we have are designed to suit every need, and the environment and convenient locations that we have suggested are now a compelling beauty destination that challenges the old fashioned way of buying".
Peter Jones 'very angry' after leaving the £11 million deal with Holly Wilogby
Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, left TV host Holly Wilogby "exasperated" after her £11 million deal with the lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wylogby has no time for them, the brand truley for furniture and accessories.
The business of the past was associated with the Guiness Paltrou brand of goop.
The 37-year-old woman, who is a guest of Zis Morning, announced on Instagram that she is dating.
Holly Wilogby has angered Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, for his last minute exit from their lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "exasperated" when he told a stressful meeting in Marlow, the business district's headquarters in Buckinghamshire that the golden man TV would spend up to £1.5 million on her new deal and that she would no longer have time to go to the furniture and accessories brand Truly for them.
The business was linked to the Gup brand Guiness Paltrou, who suggested that it had doubled Willowbin's fortune by about £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowsby announced on Instagram that she would be leaving Truly, Jones flew to a resort in a British jet.
According to one source, "truly holly was the top priority.
It was her long-term future work for the next decade.
Her decision to leave shocked everyone involved in the case.
no one could believe what happened on tuesday, it was so close to starting.
The warehouse in the main office in Marlowe city is full of ready-to-sell goods.
The morning supplier is one of Britain's leading banking stars, and experts in the sector believe that releasing him will cost a company from truss to candles and underwear millions of dollars, and will also delay his successful next trip.
as a result, his longstanding partnership may end.
Willaughey, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have a ten-year relationship with John and his wife Tara Cap.
Wilowgi further strengthened her relationship with Cap in 2016, and John, 52, became chairman in March.
The Capps Holiday tugger and Jones own 40% stake in the Bald Win TV production.
Wilogie is set to become a brand ambassador for MS, replacing ITV's celebrity provider Ant McPartlin.
Sources close to Jones said yesterday afternoon that they "did not want to comment on his business".
After an amazing conversation, we both fell in love.
Some have criticized the media for making unexpected comments from the president and thinking something positive about the North Korean leader.
Why President Trump is so angry?
Trump joked, "This is the voice of the new news reader".
i will not give up on anything.
He said that Kim was happy with the second meeting, and that the meeting was a better way to make North Korea a nuclear-free country, which was first held in Singapore in June and hosted by Trump.
but the deal to make it nuclear-free has stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat, King Ho, spoke to world leaders at the United Nations Conference, three months after the June meeting in Singapore, which said the North did not pay attention to the United States' response to the disarmament offer to North Korea.
He said that the US, on the contrary, continued to impose sanctions in an attempt to influence us.
Trump has highlighted good things in his long speech.
He said we are getting along well with North Korea.
It was leading us to war with North Korea before.
millions of people could have died.
we are now able to build good relationships.
He said their efforts to improve their relationship with Kim have yielded positive results, including theft of rockets.
When asked about their relationship with Kim, they said they disagreed.
Trump said that it would be easier to be president than to have 10,000 people in a crowded hall, pointing to the people in front of him that there are now about 200 people in the hall.
Hundreds of people died in the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia.
NGOs abroad were declared unnecessary following the Lompoc earthquake.
Although 10 percent of Lom Bok residents were displaced, no national disaster was reported.
Ms. Sambong said: "It is rare that international assistance is requested in many cases, which is very difficult.
When Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palou, it was not certain that there was a possibility for foreign experts to enter and work on the site.
According to a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutopo, Indonesian officials in Palau were conducting a monitoring of the possibility of international agencies entering and working in the area.
Indonesia has been unfortunately unable to respond to this earthquake, as it has been on several occasions.
Although tents were mostly built after the tsunami, there were few on other beaches.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palau played a major role in the deaths of people, although it did not have much effect.
Moving from one island to another in indonesia was not easy even in the cold.
natural disasters make logistics more complex.
The ship at Lom Bok Hospital was on its way to help the victims in Palou, but it will take at least 3 days to reach Palou.
President Joko Widodo pledged to work to improve Indonesia's infrastructure during the election riots, thus spending a lot of money on roads and railway expansion.
But the lack of funds for individuals has prevented the administration of Mr. Jacon from being a barrier to next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is under increasing pressure and a large number of Muslims are becoming more conservative.
Christian and Muslim mafias killed more than 1,000 people in street fighting and displaced 10,000, using leather, arrows and other weapons to shoot.

The fact that the whole issue is correct is a historical debate and will continue to be.
The fact is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the future of our country's development, and Cromwell is a well-known figure who represents an aspect of that divide.

The pig killer injured a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media, a farmer was killed in a pig attack at a market in southwestern China.
According to the Morning Post in southern China, a man named Yuan was found dead in a blood transfusion at the market in Leupanshui, Guizhou province, on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, in Zhengqing Province, China, the farmer, the owner of the pig, was preparing to vaccinate the pig.

The next morning, the nephew was found dead, the door of the pig house next door was opened.
he said that the mouth of the biggest pig had turned into blood.
Forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig was the cause of the farmer's strike, according to the report.

Remains of Typhoon Rosa are likely to cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cold coastal waters in northern Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph from 5 a.m., Category 1 hurricane, on Sunday, eastern time, and 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and move eastward along the west coast of the U.S. The storm will begin to move northward with deep tropical moisture in the southwestern U.S. as it approaches Beja California as it moves toward the tropical storm on Monday.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity then combines with the coming wetlands to cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
1 to 4 inches of rain in the area can cause dangerous flooding, landslides in the deserts and valleys.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall of about 2 to 3 inches per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In most parts of Arizona, rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected.
Due to the nature of the rainfall, which is spread by tropical rainfall, there may be a rapidly decreasing level of flooding.
It is not wise to walk into the desert in the presence of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can turn valleys into powerful rivers, causing thunderstorms to bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The approaching drought will bring some local rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Over half an inch of total rainfall can cause moderate flooding and slippery roads.
This may be the first rainfall of the local wet season.
Some of the scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona around Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain begins to spread into the evening and Tuesday.
heavy rainfall will spread in all four corners from tuesday to wednesday.

The summer heat will continue to rise again over the next few days.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October, with about 80 extending from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.

More than 20 million people have watched the trial of Brett Kavanagh.
More than 20 million people have watched the amazing testimony on the Sex Television Network of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanagh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political protests continue Broadcasters have suspended their regular schedule for last minute change, following an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that they had drunk a kavanah at a high school party and tried to strip her off.
Kavanagh said he was 100% sure that his emotional testimony did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it is estimated that more than 20.4 million people have seen it on Friday, according to the report.
The company was averaging viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network and MSNBC.
The number of other networks that showed up, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately available.
And Nelson often has some problem measuring people who he sees as offices.
To put that in a certain perspective, the audience size is the same as a critical football game or an Academy Award.
Nielsen said that Fox News Channel, which strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had led all networks with an average audience of 5.69 million in a day-long poll.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.

Flake was the central character in the Saturday drama.
The protesters were shot on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as they tried to grab elevators to go to the Justice Committee after the Republican office of the Republican Party announced its support for Kavanagh.
CNN broadcast live that they had been standing for minutes with their heads down when protested.
a woman said, "i'm standing right in front of you".
Do they think they are telling the truth to the country?
"many women have no power, but you have power", he said.
According to Flake, the office has issued a statement and can speak more during the committee hearing before the elevators close.
The Justice Committee voted for Kavanaugh's nomination for full Senate, while cable and broadcast networks were all broadcasting live.
But Flake said he could only do so because he understood the FBI would see the allegations against the candidate next week, as a few Democrats were pushing him.
Flake agreed in part after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with the Knesset and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election has the power, because Republicans are not likely to get the vote to approve Kavanagh outside the poll.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.

A volcano has spilled ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocateptel volcano have reached the southern residential areas of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the area after the volcano erupted in the well, reporting 183 gas emissions in 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring a number of loud noises and earthquakes.
Images from social media showed ashtrays covering car covers in neighborhoods like Zoquimil, Mexico City.

Police clashed with Catalan protesters ahead of the annual celebration of the vote for independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protesters clashed with the police in Aden, and thousands of people joined the protest against the annual celebration of the Catalan independence elections.
Strike groups of activists, who were masked by police with eggs and paint powder, often created a cloud of dust on the streets where visitors were submerged.
Around the end of the day, a riot broke out and police used sticks to stop the riot.
For hours, pro-development groups sang "No forgetting, no forgiveness", while those for unity sang "May Spain live forever".
According to the local newspaper, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries.
After the referendum was declared illegal in Madrid on 1 October and was celebrated by its supporters, tensions continued to rise in the independence-seeking region.
The number of people who protested the vote was lower than those who protested the vote, but voters chose to be more free.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes across the region last year by police to stop voting in polling stations.
Freedom-supporting Buddhists spent the night outside on Friday to prevent a planned protest in support of the National Police.
The protest was held but in a different way.
The 68-year-old Narcisse Termes, an electrician who joined the construction march with his wife, said they no longer had any hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
"last year we had one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents read with joy because they could vote, but now we are done", he said.
Although the local elections last December were a resounding victory, the parties promoting Catalan separatism have struggled to maintain the promise that most of their prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or awaiting trial in prison for their role in the referendum and then the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Mechanics, 42, who was recording the police demonstration by phone, said the clash was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"He is getting more stressed", he explained.
O'Reilly Huangqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.

The Doll's attacking ability forced the Hibernian club, which Gary Holtz supported, to finish second.
Zardard will face Hertz next Sunday, who is eight points ahead of Zardard without winning a single match outside the field in the Premier League.
Prior to that, ranger was the manager of the speedway vienna in the europa league.
Levine Stone continued his unbeaten progress in six games, led by head coach Holt, who replaced former coach Kenny Miller.
Living Stone missed the opportunity in a match against the guest team.
The holts team must expand their scoring gap using the Rangers' problem.
Scott Robinson turned his face towards the goal with a heavy hit, while Alan Littagha was seen only trying to get comfortable front balls for the Carig Hackets.
The concern of the outfield team is that the possibility of the Rangers being disturbed by the guest team is possible.
The critical point is not a moral role.
With the Rangers getting a perfect penalty kick, Living Stone was reinforced by DeKlan Gallagher and Robinson, and Menga, for his part, turned the ball from the middle of the field into a standout.
The Rangers were better at controlling the ball at the time, but they were more capable of defending and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was more stable.
Although the situation continued in this form, Alfredo Morelos used force against Kelly.
Scott Pittman has been in a fight with Livingston players while Alan McGregor and the league are dealing with Rangers' goalkeeper injury.
Livingston's repeatedly broken and easily knocked out goal range and the pressure of the Hawkeyes, who replaced Glenn Middleton, meant that the chances of two perfect penalties were at stake, especially one.
The "accident" was a matter of concern when we analyzed Livingstone's game

the precautions taken by man to avoid leaving a trail are amazing.
Their style of play and activity has not changed much, especially after they took the lead, but the influence of joining the team is highly appreciated by the revival that has created in the team.

Ambal Halket was huge and was especially successful in organizing the defensive division, in other words, we had to defeat the manga Conor Goldson and Joy Warrell.
Rangers' motivation for games was down.
They were good under jurat but had low performance against the standards set.
The problem with their last balls is that they are not effective after they have put pressure on the team, which makes them stand in the middle of the table and attract the team.
Ordoğan was received with special attention by Colleen.
The Turkish and German leaders were present for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September) with a clear sky and a lot of people were delighted.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to NATO, which he hoped to strengthen ties with, has reached its final day today.
He also advised on human rights, press freedom and the inclusion of Turkey in the European Union.
Ordoğan has been invited to attend the grand opening of the mosque in Cologne.
The city is home to many Turks outside Turkey.
The police said the protesters had stopped 25,000 strong protesters from marching in front of the mosque, while a large number of presidential supporters had gone out to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan's recruited opponents, many of them Kurdish, were heard voicing their voices, protesting Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to accept the man.
The stronger opposition is that there is a difference between those who see the visitors as heroes and those who view them as German-Turkish citizens and those who criticize them as dictators.

The famous combination of the storm Rosa can cause flooding damage in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, but drought-affected areas can benefit.
Tropical depression is not expected to hit Arizona, but as in the past, a combined storm, Rosa, could cause flooding in the southwest, a desert area outside of energy infrastructure.
The National Weather Service forecast flooding Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as in the city of Phoenix, including Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Following the rain that started to fall on Monday, Rosa is expected to take his progress to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In a tweet to the National Air Traffic Service about Phoenix, "Ten tropical cyclones, unique in their kind and reaching 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950, are not only causing flooding, but also threatening residents".
The storm Katrina, which rained in 1967, split the AZ region by 40 miles".
A recent model released by the National Hurricane Center predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially in the Arizona and Mogollon coastal areas, as opposed to 6 inches.
While others, especially in the southeastern Bermuda, and the Great Basin, including the central Rockies, receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, there may be up to 4 inches of rain in total.
For flood-free areas that have experienced several droughts, rainfall can be seen as a good opportunity.
Although the flooding is strong, rainfall is expected to be beneficial for some areas currently affected by drought, such as the southeast.
According to the US "drought control body, 40 percent of Arizona has experienced the worst drought, the second-worst", weather.com reported.
The first, a rainy storm named Rosa, made its way to Mexico, in Baja California Peninsula, causing severe landslides.
The strong rose will start 385 miles south of Punta Ignacia, and continue northward at 12 miles per hour with strong winds on Sunday morning through Mexico.
The flood will cool the waters of the Pacific and provide energy to the ocean.
Therefore, the strength of tropical floods is expected to cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon.
Heavy rainfall is expected in various parts of Mexico, followed by severe flooding.
"From Baja California to northwest Sonora, the total rainfall is expected to be 3 to 6 inches, and it is expected to reach 10 inches", reports weather.com.
Rosa will travel north through Mexico before reaching the shores of Arizona on Tuesday morning, and continue to Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday afternoon.
"The main threat to Roza and its ensuing weather is the heavy rainfall expected in Baja California, northwestern California and across the United States in the arid southwest", says the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to endanger life, cause flooding, and cause flood debris to accumulate in desert areas and may cause landslides, especially in mountainous areas.

Trump said "Cavanaff is very tired, very uncooperative and disgusting to the Democratic Party".
"Voting for the lawyer Kavanaugh means giving the Democratic Party the following tactical space of cruelty and brutality", Trump said in a protest at the Wheeling, West Virginia, election campaign.
Trump said "Cavanaff is a deception and a frustration in the Democratic Party's electoral process".

"The most important election we have seen in our lifetime has been five weeks since the election was completed.
he said: "i am not running, but i am running well.
"that's why i'm ready to sign up with the big candidates everywhere".

The first practical election for Kavanaugh's candidacy will be held before Friday, the Senate has announced, the senior leadership of the Grand Old Party told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths and deaths are expected to rise in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
An official said Sunday that Sulawesi, one of Indonesia's islands, has killed at least 384 people and displaced many following the tsunami and the massive wave of beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palau on Friday, while watching the sun set on a 6 meter or 18 foot high wave evening, causing a lot of damage and destruction, including everything he found.
The area was hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake following the tsunami.
"At the time of the tsunami threat yesterday, many were doing their usual activities on the beach, and they did not try to escape, and they were then displaced", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, of the Indonesian emergency management agency BNPB, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it rocked cars, towers, houses, hit everything on the ground", said Nuguho, not only that, but it was traveling at 800 km/h (497 mph) across the entire Pacific Ocean before hitting the coast.
a few people climbed a tree and survived the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people were taken to 24 stations in Palou.
The disaster agency's aerial photos showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges destroyed and a mosque surrounded by water.
A mild earthquake on Saturday continued to shake the coastal city.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology and Applications said the force of the quake in Arbu was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location, which is surrounded by a long narrow estuary, would have made the tsunami more likely, he said.
According to Nuguho, the damage was "extensive" and thousands of homes, hospitals and shops were destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found under the rubble of the buildings, with a total of 540 injured and 29 missing, he said.
Death and destruction could be high on the Donggala beach, 300 km (190 miles) north of Nagorno-Karabakh, the location of which is near the middle of the earthquake.
No data could be transferred from the Donggala area due to the lack of communication tools, said Nuguho.
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that the organization's staff and volunteers have led to the site.
"This is very sad, but it can get worse", he said.
The agency was accused of failing to provide information on the tsunami's impact on Pallu, although the authorities warned that the tsunami had arrived early.
A video posted on social media by an amateur shows a man on a building announcing the approach of the tsunami with a loud and frightening sound.
Within minutes, a towering tsunami arrived from the coast and began carrying cars and buildings
rotors could not verify the video image immediately.
The earthquake has rendered the rescue effort difficult, with power lines in the Palau area being disused.
The army is flying relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but officials say the displaced people desperately need food and other basic assistance.
The city's airline has reopened for emergency operations only, but will remain closed until October.

deaths from the Indonesian tsunami will be more than 800.
It's very bad.
While the World Vision people in Donggala had reached the city of Palou, where their staff were trapped in tents, they had faced serious dangers on their journey, said Mr. Dosemba.
"They told me that many houses are in disrepair", he said.
It's very bad.
When aid workers started their overseas work, some experienced foreigners were also denied access to Palou.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid can only come after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
and this has not yet been done.
"It is still considered a state emergency", said Ayalya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government approves, we will open ourselves to international assistance, but we will not say anything".
After the earthquake and tsunami on Saturday, pallu is on its second day, and friends and families hope that the people who lost their lives in that dark and terrible disaster will be found by some miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in a floodgates.
On Sunday, a woman who had been under the rubble for two days was rescued.
Gendon Sabandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, was training two paragliders for the Asian Games, which ends this month, but both were lost in the accident.
The others who were blocked by Roa Roa and Tuttle were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As an experienced para-gliding professional, I am personally under a lot of stress and emotion.
After hearing the news of the demolition of the Rowa Rowa Hotel, Mr. Gendon sent a WhatsApp message to the Palau contestants at the Beach Festival, saying the situation had already spread in the paragliding community.
He only got one grey check and one blue check.
"that means the messages didn't arrive", he said.

[1Kanya West: The rapper changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He wrote on Twitter on Saturday about the change: "A person with the name Kanya West in the register".
West, 41, was briefly nicknamed "Y" and used the moniker for his eighth album, released on June 8.
The change comes ahead of the live release of his new album, Yandee, on Saturday.
The show's producer announced that Arya and Grande will be performing in her place, although she had to cancel her work "because of the uncertainty".
Although the name is a professional acronym of the time, he had previously said that the word has a religious meaning.
"I believe the word 'Y' is mentioned many times in the bible, and was introduced in an interview with the big boy radio station, where it replaced the english word 'you'.
" this is you, this is us, this is us.

The Mexican MLO pledged not to use military force against the public
In a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the brutal attacks on students by Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, they promised that the same atrocity would not be committed by the military.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in the Plaza de Tallatelco that "they will not use military force to suppress Mexican citizens at all".
It was during the beginning of the political revolution in Latin America that leftist politicians shot and killed about 300 demonstrators on the same square on 2 October 1968.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to university students and opening more free public universities.
He also said that the lack of unemployment and educational institutions is leading young people to organized crime.
U.S. Artificial IntelligenceU.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Kai-Fu Li, an investor and artificial intelligence expert at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China is stepping up its involvement in artificial intelligence, the United States should allocate twice as much money to research and research in the field as it does now.
The comments followed the release of AI ads by various US government agencies, which have shown that the country does not even have an artificial intelligence strategy.
However, China announced its intention last year to become the No. 1 Artificial Intelligence by 2030.
"While doubling the number of other countries is a good start, we are working to make a productive change", Lee said.
Li said in an interview with CNN this week that doubling the funding would make the next productive discovery American: [2]
Li published his book Artificial Intelligence Superpower is Cheating China, Silicon Valley and New World Order, by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed the highest-ranked artificial intelligence system in the American Otello player at Carnegie Mellon University, and then served as the executive director of Microsoft Research and Research and Google China.
According to Lee, the U.S. government has previously asked when similar competitions would be held to identify the next generation of visionaries, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects, the agency's robotics challenge technology competitions.
Researchers in the US stressed that they must work hard to win government grants.
"China is not taking the corporate leaders, it is the companies", Li said.
Facebook, Google and Microsoft have hired high-profile students to work on artificial intelligence.
Li said the shift in the refugee police will have a major impact on China's artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think we should have a green card for students working in artificial intelligence phd", he said.
The Chinese State Council released its next generation artificial intelligence development program in July 2017.
China's National Center for Natural Sciences provides financial support to educational institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government funds in the US, but the quality of Chinese education work is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which enables industry and education to participate, and the White House announced the establishment of a separate committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it has allocated $2 billion for the Artificial Intelligence Next project.[2]
NSF will invest more than $100 million in artificial intelligence research and development.
Meanwhile, the US law to establish the National Security Commission has not registered any activity this month.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country or keep it
Last Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to decide whether the country should be called the Republic of North Macedonia or not, which is expected to break the decades-long alliance with Greece that left the country out of the European Union and NATO.
The Greek state of Macedonia, which has the same name, has used this name to block its right to vote to become a member of NATO or the European Union.
The two countries reached an agreement in June under this name, but it has been criticized by nationalists as undermining the identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Giorgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but he also expressed concern that the referendum would be able to get the 50 percent of the people who voted in the same way.
The petition on the ballot reads: "Stop giving up my marriage to Greece and choose to become a member of NATO and the European Union".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the cost of making Macedonia a member of NATO and the European Union, which is among the member states of Yugoslavia that have voted to abolish the referendum, should be paid.
"I came here today to choose the best for my better country tomorrow, especially the young people in Macedonia who will live freely under the shadow of the European Union, because this will lead us all to a comfortable life", said 79-year-old Oliveira Gojjavaska in a speech at Skippy
He said that a sufficient number of members of parliament would vote and accept it as critical, although it is not legally prohibited.
The change of name must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The country's Election Commission said at 1 p.m. that there were no problems with the election.
The number of voters who voted against the parliamentary elections last year was 34 percent, compared with 16 percent, but this election, 66 percent of those registered to vote voted.
"I'm here to vote because of my children, my home is Europe", said Josie Tanesky, 62, who voted in Skopje, the capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change on 30 September 2018, which would help NATO and the EU join.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, with the opposition to the referendum, set up a small stage and set up chairs in front of the tent.
"We are with NATO and the European Union, but we joined with a straight neck, not a lowly one to benefit others", said Kovatakov.
"We are a poor nation, but we are honored"
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we will turn our faces to China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian Alliance".
Prime Minister Zaev said that becoming a NATO member would bring a lot of investment opportunities to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
After the vote, Zaev said: "I believe that more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO".
He says that the result of "yes" is a guarantee of the future".
A poll by the Macedonian Police Research Institute last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters took part in the referendum, which also showed a lower number of non-voters.
In another poll conducted by Macedonian TV's Talma, 57 percent of respondents confirmed that they plan to vote next Sunday.
70% of respondents said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, one of the respondents must get a vote of 50 percent.
The fall of the referendum marks the first time that a policy that has been in place since May last year, which has been in the interests of the Western government, has failed.

Trump's march in support of West Virginia
The president has been critical of the high court's decision to elect Brett Kavan, saying it is important to win the Republican with the best half.
"Everything we did in November was consistent.
Five weeks have passed since the most important choice we have ever made in our lives.
This is one of the big ones: I'm not running, I'm running well, which is why I'm everywhere to be the best candidate.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible group of scary Democrats, you see what's happening.
They are also trying to take power by using every possible option, and you see their weakness and their corruption.
"As long as they have power, they don't care if anyone hurts them. They want to have power and control, and we won't give it to them".
According to him, "Democrats are on a mission of resistance and destruction".
"As you saw, the last four days, Democrats were called 'angry, useless, arrogant and liars.'
He raised the Senate Legislative Committee and called Senate Democrat Danny Fennstein by name, and the audience was overwhelmed with support.
"Do you remember me?
Did you get the document?
What is it?

The GC meeting on Friday night was the best in my eight years as Labour MP.
sadly, today there may not be much assembly sound, and "good, good" politics have been around for a long time, unless perhaps it is a new one
The Labour Party is increasingly ignoring the distinct ideas, and the ideas will only be accepted if they are accepted by the leadership of the party.
This started after Jeremy's time in office, and when I was with him, I already thought I could take power by accepting and supporting the so-called political views, by agreeing to national security or even the single market of the European Union, which I disagree with.
When I speak publicly, what I say is not a problem; what is causing the problem is the misinformation on social media, and the ideas that are against politics and that I should not continue in the Labour Party.
And that's not my experience.
Of course, i believe i am more fortunate than my friends, because the opinions that come to me are of political content.
I personally appreciate his profession and the hard work and dedication of my colleagues who face the daily harsh sexual and racist attacks.
The most annoying thing about politics is the fact that the amount of influence that happens is common.
Gerby Corbyn last week suggested that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that there is no big faith, and changing the electoral law without any confidence in every motion will make the party weaker.
"I have been given advice over the past two years to be humble and not to be too talkative, and now I am successful"
But I didn't bring that into politics.
Inspired by the Thatcher government, when my overall academic performance began to decline after I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, I thought I could become a local councillor or government minister to serve many in the public service.
I did not hide my political views, including the last election.
in west nottingham there is no one who is confused about my policy stance and disagrees with current leadership.
I want to say to all those who support the Friday motion that I can't afford to waste time and money on the BRI exhibition, knowing that my loyalty to the Labour Party is affecting the country's living conditions, business and public utility services.
I have a message, not only to stop the Nottingham movement but also to the Constitution, which applies to the Labour Party and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise, no threat or political comfort will stop me from meeting your needs and doing what I believe in.

Ayr 38  17 Melros: The unforgiving Ayr moves on
The two late ones are nearing the final, but Ayr will no doubt finish the day's tennis premiership
They are leading the table with 10 games to spare.
Finally, the strong defensive line and the ability of the players to take advantage of the opportunities helped them win on the pitch, which was followed by the coach Peter Murchey.
"We have been tested in many matches and not lost a single one, so I am happy", he said.
"Thanks to Ayr, they created better opportunities for us", said mollers Robin Christy.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute try was scored by Fraser Clemm and Ayr took the lead, but the yellow card awarded to Scotland's Rory Hughes led the Warriors to a lead and allowed Melrose to move better and to try balls that failed to score.
Clemmons goal, which was Ayr's lead in the half, proved to be a perfect penalty kick, and further personal efforts led Ayr to score more goals and lead the team to a 17-5 overall record.
Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson had to change the gap to just five.
Ayr was able to take over the lead at Clymo after a long-standing injury, which left him out of the game from the start, and then at Stafford McDowell.
When Ayr's amber player Blair Maperson saw a yellow card, Melrose was replaced by Brooke Colvin following the pressure from the surrounding area to delay the game.
Despite the field advantage, Strahan Hitchinson saw Clemon throw a yellow card outside the penalty area, Ayr McPherson, who was the top scorer, was hit from behind and fell.

These expectations were high for nearly a decade before Bolivia filed a lawsuit before the International Criminal Court on October 1 after five years of relief.
"Bolivia must see the exit with strength, unity and freedom from stress with a positive attitude", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadailla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ's decision on the big screens in the country, hoping that a decade-long and fruitless speech in the Hague litigation will determine Chile as the sovereign country of the sea, Bolivia.
The decision of Monday will not be a relief for the half-favored and controversial Bolivian president Evo Morales, who is now running for re-election next year.
"We are getting very close to the Pacific Ocean", he said last August.
But some analysts have expressed their belief that the court's decision will not condemn the extremist violence in Bolivia and that if they do, they will change that.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands has no authority to determine the Chilean border, nor does it have the authority to determine the outcome of any possible talks.
International law expert Honut's Chilean Paz Zarat said that the fact that the International Criminal Court's decision is known six months after the final hearing of the two disputes "indicates that the case is not serious".
They can take us back four years beyond the exact cause of Bolivia.
"The issue of the sea approach has been blocked by the Bolivian administration", said today.
Morales' opponent said in her speech that the decision would protect the dignity of the Chileans.
i think bolivia and chile have a hard time talking about the time of the hon.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former president Rodriguez Valdez, who represented Bolivia in the Hague, said the speed at which the court reached a decision was unusual.
"Bolivia will open a new phase of relations with Chile on Monday and work to benefit both countries, putting aside the disagreements that have been going on for 139 years", he said.
Morales, one of Latin America's most prominent presidents, said Calzadaila is using the maritime issue to create political fever.
"Bolivia will not waive its legal rights to use the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The decision is a good opportunity to resolve past issues"
North Korea says it is unlikely to stop nuclear unless the US can believe it
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said the country would not like nuclear weapons unless it first gained confidence in the United States.
They were speaking at the UN General Assembly last Saturday.
The United States must keep its word as promised at the Singapore Summit of the Leading Nations.
His comments came as the United States: The UN Secretary-General is trying to restart the now-forgotten nuclear diplomacy in Singapore, three months after talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Rey said the continuation of the sanctions was a 'dream', and that the US refused to accept the ending of the two-Korean war and North Korea did not bow down.
The United States is questioning the agreement that Pyongyang will not significantly reduce its weapons.
Both Kim and US President Trump want a second conversation.
Pyongyang is not expected to cut equipment to protect her safety, which has led to widespread doubts.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month and facilitate the second round of talks between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show has introduced a number of headwear to the industry.
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun, look nowhere.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a large-scale hat for their SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week, which they hope will continue their creative work.
This winter, unusable hats have been crowding Instagram, and designers have turned their eye-catching creations to catwalks.
Valentino's hat was decorated with a long, labby frame and was a spark of innovation.
Other large hats, such as those decorated with treasure and pineapple and witch hats, are not designed to provide heating for the head.
Tom also offers a silver facial mask for the holidays.
Other facials of different colors look more like Hannibal Lester than their lips and other things like red cotton.
When an invention looks like a scuba diving left, it looks like it's full of snorkels and goggles, the rest looks like cone-shaped ice cream melted.
If you continue to visit the biggest fashion houses, you are certainly not lucky.
Many hats with straps on their hooves are attracting the attention of many stylists.
The large cap, made of silk and two feet long, was found alongside the long hill called 'La Bomba', from Rihanna to Emiliaratjkovsky and several others.
The unique size of the hat was the next best innovation in the Cat series, attracting a lot of attention on social media, and a dark yellow bag was also made to be as big as a swimsuit.
At Paris Fashion Week, the Ravera SS19 collection was presented with a black orange, frosted-out, white laser handbag.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main street next summer - it's hard to say there will be no need for these large sized special uses as the designer has had such a huge impact.'
John Edward: Language skills are useful for international citizens.
Private schools in Scotland have achieved a record high performance in 2018, with strong work by individuals and groups in sports, art, music and other community-based activities.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools represents more than 30,000 schools in Scotland, and the schools are committed to providing excellent services to students and parents.
The private schools are working with the aim of supporting their students to choose a career and place for further education as citizens.
As a curriculum designer and implementer, modern languages have become the topics of choice in schools, including the reputation of modern languages.
Nelson Mandela said: "When talking to a speaker, let him understand.
when talking to the speaker, let him have the same mindset".
It should be noted that we should not rely solely on english to establish relationships and build trust with the peoples of other countries.
The top performing languages in private schools this year are the ones that are understood according to the league table.
68% of the students have achieved a grade of A in foreign languages.
Data collected from SCIS and focused on 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of the highest A scores were in Mandarin, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in scotland believe that foreign languages are important for the future of children and young people.
It is currently offered as a single course in the private school curriculum and in other languages, such as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission found that language problems were the main reason why 17 percent of employees had difficulty filling out job advertisement forms.
Therefore, developing more and more language skills is crucial for the future of young people's career.
In a sovereign world, language skills are useful for most job opportunities.
not in terms of the chosen field of work, but learn a second language and have the same benefits as remaining with them for a reasonable period of time.
multilingual people to communicate directly with foreign nationals will win the competition.
According to Yogov, in the 2013 election, more than 4,000 UK youths took part in the poll, with 75 percent not being able to speak foreign languages fluently and French being the only language spoken by two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to spend money on teaching children the language now.
The ability to create multiple jobs will create meaningful employment opportunities for children, especially those with developing economies.
In scotland, each school has a different language.
A large number of schools teach more in modern languages, while others, such as Mandarin or Japanese, are teaching in the future after 2020 with the United Kingdom as the most important language.
The possibility of choosing the languages your child wants to learn in private schools, regardless of their needs, is also possible with the help of specialists in the field.
Scottish private schools are committed to creating an educational environment that prepares children for future success and makes them talented.
In the global business environment, language is crucial for the future of countries, so it should be remembered that it should be included in education at this time.
In fact, modern consultancies should pay attention to "international understanding skills".
Private schools will continue to offer diversity and kindness as a choice for Scottish youth.
I have to do it well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.

Trump's support for West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Trump launched a series of support campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is one of five Trump plans for next week, which will include extending the friendship between Tennessee and the Mississippi.
As the vote to confirm the nomination of the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump is planning to rally support for the Republicans in mid-term elections next November, as Congress is in danger of falling out of Republican control.
Trump's march in West Virginia will take place at what time of night, and how can it be streamed live on the Internet?
Trump's move to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. eastern time Saturday night, September 29, 2018.
Trump's demonstration in West Virginia can be seen live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address a hearing this week in the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court nominee, Rhett Kavanaugh, is expected to testify, complicating the case by alleging child sexual abuse, and there is speculation that the Senate could vote to extend the term by a week until the FBI completes its investigation.
The purpose of this series of movements is to enable the Republicans to reach their potential for the upcoming November elections.
So, according to President Trump's campaign, the five moves next week are aimed at "inciting the goodwill of the volunteers and supporters to preserve and expand the Republican seat in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is his top agenda, and as we approach President Fata's campaign season, they will go to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who did not want to be named.
The planned march to the Wesbank Arena and Howling tonight is expected to "gather supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, attracting the attention of the Pittsburgh media", according to a West Virginia Metro report.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time last month, where the Times won by more than 40 percent in 2016.

"The fact that the president is coming to make the competition is not a good sign for Morrissey", said Simon Heather, a political scientist in West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 Tim America show giving life to the game hope will be held on Sunday among singles
After only three one-way races, the four-man race on Saturday afternoon seems to be one of the requirements for this Ryder Cup.
The hanging game is entirely a product of the sporting concept, but a player believes in such competitions without seeing anything.
So when do they say the height is now?
"They led by six points, and now by four, so I guess we'll just take that as a little bit of a step", he said, walking slowly.
Europe has a better lead, but there are twelve games left
The Americans feel that Space has a very narrow chance, even though they have a higher chance of getting ahead, especially from players like Space and Justin Thomas who have played together all day, who say they each get four out of three points.
Speys is a killer, and he's the model that leads from T to Green.
As his turn grew, the riots and shouts of joy grew, and he and Thomas used decisive and effective blows to draw the fourth game, which he and Thomas beat two lower than the second.
The same scream that struck the 15th-place finisher was the same one that made the American team believe they were not out of the race.
"You really have to think hard and worry about your game", says sepis.
This is the main thing every player ignores.
18 Holes to be Marked
The only players to score more points than spike and thomas in the last two years are francisco molinari and tommy flewwood, an undeniable rider trophy story.
The most confusing but beloved couple in Europe is four out of four, and they don't make any mistakes.
After the "Mollywood" Saturday afternoon, Mollywood were the only couple who could not get into a hole in one shot, and they also avoided scoring a goal in one shot on Saturday morning.
All that running and the power of the fans and fans made it look like they were the winners of the match on Sunday, there was no known player to beat the Europeans because the sun was shining on the Molinaires above the National Golf Club and Flightwood.
in a directory, both at the same time, but in different wells.
Although it is not possible to talk about the pride of Europeans.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson worked a little on Sergio Garcia, one of the morning's pair of stars, and that was to pair him with Alex Norner.
The spanish and swedish have scored a single goal and two goals in one of the holes he has thrown in front of me, which they have never seen before.
even if there is no one to help on sunday, get out of your own pit.
Two-pair and four-four games are very interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the two, when they are engaged, when they are not engaged, and how the strategy changes in the moment.
Europe have played better as a team so far and were the main lead on the final day but as Tim America showed in a four-on-four game, they are keen to play despite the doubts from the Stateside.
Europe lead 10-6 to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy lead until the final of the Ryder Cup, which is a match-up of two and four-four from Saturday, leading the Americans 10-6.
The reborn pair Timothy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari have won two games against Tiger Wood, leading the league to a four-point lead in the league's national points standings.
Thomas Beauregard, for the Europeans, managed to take a 3-1 lead on the list, beating the United States, who were out of the game in the morning, to avoid losing the trophy to Hazeltine two years ago.
The United States had better than the four-four, won two games, but could not feed enough to fill the gap.
Jim Furyk needs eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to avoid the trophy
Fleetwood is the newest European to score four points, and he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, are the second pair to score four points in their opening four games following an exciting weekend in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating both Woods and Patrick in the match, they went on to become more powerful and beat the infamous Woods and the new American boy, Bryson DeChambra, with a still bigger and more significant 5&4.
Woods, who scored two goals in Saturday's match, lost 19 of 29 matches in double and four-four and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had spent the morning's doubles break, returned in a four-four match, along with his friend Henrik Stenson, to win Dustin Johnson and Brooke Coepan: first and third place in the world.
Despite a nice windy day in western paris, what Europe has not found
Three-time major winners Jordan Speys and Justin Thomas set an example for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In a single match, they scored a shining point against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Palter, and Paulter and Rory McCracken went on to win 4&3 in a four-on-four match.[2]
Although it is only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team can return to a single game after a four-point deficit, despite only needing a goalless split to avoid the trophy through Furyk.
The second best for two canons, but the Sunday replay seems to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that without faith it will "never" disarm
North Korea's foreign ministry told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were deepening distrust of the United States and that it was unable to stop its nuclear weapons separately.
According to the International Institute's General Conference, Yong Ho, North Korea has taken good steps last year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the test site and pledging to not use nuclear weapons.
"But we didn't get a consistent response from the US", he said.
"We cannot rely on our national security without any confidence in America, we cannot unleash ourselves in such a situation".
While Rim also complained about North Korea's common practice of denying nuclear weapons and denying Washington the right to receive the appropriate reward for this, the statement made it seem necessary for Pyongyang to never abandon its previous program of denying nuclear weapons.
Re quoted a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump, which was the first meeting between the incumbent US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore, and said that Kim promised to liberate the Korean Channel from the nuclear zone, while Trump said he would provide security assurance to North Korea.
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 war, but the US says Pyongyang should prioritize its nuclear program.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States first advocates for the "prohibition of nuclear weapons", and then uses sanctions to force the proliferation of such weapons, "and then opposes the ceasefire", Re said.
"The idea of trying to get us to the ground using sanctions is a failed dream and the idea of deaf people who do not know us.
the continued sanctions have deepened the distrust between us.
Ri passed without mentioning the US leader's protest at the UN over the second meeting between Trump and Kim.
The ministry instead cited three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding that "without the United States as the actor in the nuclear disarmament issue, South Korea would not have been in the trouble of getting its Korean nation out of nuclear power".
While Lee's voice was very different from last year, the General Assembly, speaking to the United Nations, targeted the mainland of the United States after the inevitable North Korean rocket hit "Mr. President" Trump Kim as "Rocket Man".
Trump did not threaten to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, but this year he praised Kim's efforts to disarm, but said many jobs were still pending and sanctions should continue until North Korea declares its nuclear program.
As Trump said, "If it takes two years, three months, or five months, that's not a problem".
China and Russia are arguing over the UN, and the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
But the United States, the Secretary General of the Security Council, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must continue unabated and unconditionally until the process of dismantling nuclear weapons results".
The Security Council has secretly imposed sanctions on North Korea to halt funding for Pyongyang's development of nuclear and ballistic missiles since 2006.
Pompeo met with the EU's ruler, René, and the General Assembly said they would visit Pyongyang next month to facilitate a second round of talks.
Pompeo Semen visited Korea for the third time this year alone, but the third visit did not produce the expected results.
When they released Julai Pyongyang in July, they were reportedly organizing their forces in a time difference, declaring they had registered changes".
In a meeting with the Moon this month, North Korea said the United States should "take the same action" to destroy its missile stations and nuclear facilities.
He said Kim "takes the same steps" and wants to ensure their security, while Trump said Singapore promised to improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students took a break from school to get enough.
'All undergraduate students at Harvard University have been trained to get enough sleep this year and to stop studying with 'a lot of caffeinated stuff' overnight.
The world's number one university, which produces the most talented students in the world, was told that its students have a low understanding of what they are basically and how they see themselves.
Charles Esler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Birmingham and Women's Hospital, and Women's Hospital, have developed a course they believe is unique in the US.
The lack of sleep has been motivated to start training on its impact on education.
'Finally, a woman came to me and asked, 'Why have I been told this now, and not in years?'
Assa said that no one told her about the benefits of bed, assa told telegraph of his surprise.
The course, which was first offered this year, tells students that good sleep will help them to improve their academic and athletic performance and maintain their overall health.
Paul Barrera, a professor at Harvard Medical School and director of university health services, said he decided to promote the course after finding students with severe sleep problems during the week.
The hourly training involves many involved activities.
In one room, students report on the athletic fitness decline, regular bedtime, and the effects of coffee toothpaste, curtains, trainers, caffeine and light, and insufficient sleep.
In the other class, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation increased the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
The training participants will be encouraged to think about their daily activities in an engaging way.
'we know that the behavior of students does not change immediately.
We believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking, said Professor Sessler.
There is still a culture of sleeplessness, which he says is a growing problem due to the use of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students.
Make sure you get enough sleep with a good comfort, which is a secret tool for students to stop anxiety, fatigue and anxiety, and he says that sleep deprivation will make the brain feel hungry and constantly hungry.
The 19-year-old is studying California chemistry and physical biology and helped to train Professor Sessler, who took the course last year during his freshman year at Harvard University.
he revealed that the course made him open his eyes and encouraged him to take other courses on campus.
He hoped that he would tell all postgraduate students to attend similar programs and complete training before going to the next competitive institutions.
Professor Chessler recommends that students use a bra to go to bed and get up, and that they should be aware that the blue lights emitted by electronic screens and LEDs are harmful, which also causes heartbeat disturbances and sleep problems.
Living Stone 1-0 Rangers: The goal of the manga has disappointed the Gerard players.
Rangers suffered a defeat, and the team that was defeated by Steven Gerrard in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston by Dolly Menga.
The Ibrox were looking to record their first win since their 4-1 win over San Jose, but Gary Holtz's team was weakened: Gerard ruined the lead by eight points, taking his second win in 18 games.
Meanga was exhausted with seven minutes left in the first half, and the Rangers played the field with good motivation.
Now that the Rangers are down to sixth, the Living Stones have been relegated to third place by a goal-scoring hybrids.
It is expected that there may be another foul in the Rangers' property, and if the lineman is not, Spain will be hit in the head with a shot from the other side.
Zardard made eight substitute changes in the semi-final match against Betfred, which saw Ayr beaten out of the competition.
In other words, when Holt beat Hertz last week with the Livi 11, they are happy to be able to worry their opponents in every game.
rangers were better at controlling the ball, but living stones were also seen to do better with the ball.
Menga's goal for Allen McGregor, which knocked Scott Pittman out of the competition, should be scored within two minutes, but could increase his chances.
When Keegan Jacobs hit a strong penalty kick against Craig Hallett, his defender friend Alan Litgo tried to block his goal.
Rangers were good at controlling the ball, and they were more confident in their third place game than they were in their confidence to cover it.
Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lowell had a fight in the first quarter, but Judge Steven Thompson ignored the Columbia petition.
Rangers tried two goals in the first half, with former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly disrupted by back-to-back goals from LaSana and Coliballi and a shocking test from Ove Ijaria.
Livy's 34th minute opener is against the passing game, and no one can deny that they deserve it.
rangers have failed to speak to jacob again.
Scott arfield as the declan gallagher gave the ball to scoring scorer scored by scoring a goal for scoring by men.
1]Jarrard was able to change the calibaline to the rest of Ryan Kent and create an effect, so that Merylos's wingman could immediately blow the gap and create more impact, while the amazing Kelly tried to prevent it.
But the Living Stones must use long balls to play the kind of game the stranger likes.
As the Holtz strengthened their lead in the final rounds, the Lithgow tried to stop Jacob before he could attack from the corner.
Although the Rangers' newcomer Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty after Jacob's robbery, Thompson ignored him.
The Almanac is the creator of the Giger counter.
The pages are now taken from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882 136 years ago today, he continues the count... The day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gager developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the development of a device called the Gager counter.
The science-backbone, the famous giggle counter, was played by scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1995 film "Bells of Coronado".
The man asked, "What is in the world?"
Rogers said: "Giger counters were used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put a headset in your ear, you can hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the ore".
Evans: "Sure, it will be broken now!"
"Hans" Gregor died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
but his fear kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine has created a unique immune system for our body.
The new cancer vaccine has led to the formation and death of abnormal cells in our body's immune system.
The vaccine releases cells that are critical to our immune system, which is part of the treatment.
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient in a laboratory.
then it is common to see protein in many cancers and it is then re-administered.
The vaccine being tested against cancer is showing promising results.
A woman who received the vaccine developed a new virus and the cancer in her ovaries disappeared for more than 18 months.
When the immune cell is removed from the patient and transplanted into the laboratory, a protein called HER2 is detected in many cancers and the cell is then replaced.
Jay Berzowski, a professor at the United Nations Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "As the results show, we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "provides growth of various types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, breast and lung cancer", says professor Berzowski.
The study of how to take the emyune cell from the patient and track the cancer cell is the same as the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West was criticized by Trump for having made the MAGA hat after appearing on SNL.
It's not going well.
Kanye West was heard in the studio on Saturday night praising America for his speech on the live broadcast about his less-than-effective performance: President Donald Trump said he would be in office in 2020.
After playing the third and Ghost Town music of the evening, he announced that he was supporting the march by shoving the Democratic Party with a hat and saying that Make America Great was a hat.
"I often go out with white people and they say, 'How could you love Trump? He's racist.'"
Well! if I had thought about racism, I would have left America many years ago".
The SNL show is hosted by Matt Damon, a Hollywood star, and is hosted by Brett Kavanaugh, and focuses on the allegations of sexual assault by the Senate Legal Committee, a group of women led by Christine Beasley Ford.
A moving image of Western anger posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock and not shared in the media.
It's not clear to me that you're trying to fool West.
West told the audience that he had a difficult time with his headgear behind the stage.
"I was intimidated by the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go to the box'
They frightened me!
According to the washington examiner, they say i'm in a stable place
The Westerners continued, "Do you want to see a low place?" and then he said, "Put on my superman hat, because that means you won't tell me what I do.

West received support from conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the greatest heroes of all time, we thank you for standing with the people".
However, as talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted, West simply said, "It's self-contained and it's beautiful".
"but i don't choose to encourage someone by buying the music or the clothes or the 'artwork') this is a dangerous attitude in my mind.
He is free.
And we also said, "she said:
When the rapper announced the change of name on Twitter before the show, he said on his Twitter page, "This is the man who was known in Kanye West".

A suicide attempt at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man beat up a man at a Belfast restaurant and was tried for murder.

The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will be the final prosecutor.
The game's goal for Yves Saron is that star Keith Harington is caught in a dangerous manhood.
Keith Harington played the role of a young, gullible young man named John Shaw in HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, a male pioneer, said that such roles make young boys think they need to be strong enough to be respected.
There's something wrong with the Sunday Times culture and it asks how to fight this deadly ideology of crime.
Keith, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, a supporting actress in Game of Thrones, said: "I feel it's very important".
'I have a strong feeling that tiger is wrong about crime right now?' he said.
'In view of the current problems, what were we teaching boys?'
Television is largely responsible for crime, especially in part, thanks to its criminal characters.
he continued, 'what are natural and what are natural?
what made the young man feel so masculine in the streets, in the TV, in the education?
This is the big question of our time: how do we change this?
The reason is that something is wrong with our young man.
In his interview, he said that the series ended next summer with no pre- or post-series working, announcing that he would stop 'warfare and horseback riding'.
From next November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepards' remake of True West, a film about a rapist brother of a film producer.
Recently, the actor revealed that he planned to meet his wife Rose and said he thought she was his favorite from Game of Thrones.
'it was on this show that i met my wife, so she gave me my future wife, and my life will be there from now on. '
Kate's character John Shaw played Rose Yegret in the Emmy Award-winning series Fantasy as a love interest.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leisley family estate in Scotland.
China announces 14% increase in new cases of HIV/AIDS
China announced that its population living with HIV and AIDS has jumped to 14%.
Health officials, one of the victims of more than 820,000 cases, said:
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
most new cases are in sexual intercourse, which has changed from last year.
HIV transmission in some parts of China has been the most common form of transmission so far through the donation of contaminated blood to the healthcare system.
But in such a situation, the number of HIV cases has been reduced to almost zero, a Chinese health official in Yunnan province said.
But every year, 100,000 people living with HIV in China are growing.
HIV transmission through prostitution is a major issue in the LGBT community in China.
The same sex trafficking is also reported to be increasing in crime in China since 1997, when it was declared a crime.
In the country's conservative culture, studies suggest that 70-90% of men who have sex with men may eventually marry women.
Most HIV transmission is due to insufficient care in these areas.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV treatment accessible nationwide as part of efforts to solve the problem of AIDS.
Maxie Waters GOP denies Senate data and explosion of 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
The United States denied on Saturday that a colleague of mine, Maxie Waters, posted personal information of three U.S. senators on the parliament's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrats have been hailed as the "extremist wing" of the day and are now spreading the word.
"Lies are lies and shameful lies", Waters wrote on her Twitter page.
The release of the information included your US home and phone address: Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch both from Ottawa.
The information was posted on the Internet by an unknown person on Thursday by Cattolic Hill, who was testifying against Senate panel candidate for Supreme Court nominee Rhett Kavanaugh on charges of sexual misconduct.
The test was conducted after three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
The IP address of the computer posted by conservative websites such as Gateway Pandit and Red State is linked to the Water Office and the information of the Water employee has been released, according to The Hill report.
"This fundamental accusation is a complete lie, Waters", she said.
"The identity, personal information and security of my colleague was compromised by this false and fraudulent accusation and the information was never the responsibility of the Shiloq.
This is a completely false allegation".
Waters' statement was quickly criticized, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fletcher.
"This is apostasy", wrote fletcher, "and it is anger".
"This shows that she has no patience to become a congresswoman.
they should not be angry when someone is criticized for a job they did not do.
they must not be disobedient.
they should not ask what the thief wants.
they need to be calm and peaceful.
Fletcher compares Waters' situation to the one in which he was furious at Thursday's rally, where Democrats denounced Judge Kavanaugh.
Omar Navarro, who was running to remove Waters from office during the midterm elections, tweeted.
"If it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters' office said the fraudulent allegation "has changed the proper authorities and law enforcement.
"We will ensure that those who committed the act are exposed", he continued, "and will be held legally responsible for any of our members and for all their destructive and dangerous actions".
Johnny England Strike: The Strike of the Disabled Rowan Atkinson
Now it is becoming common to see the importance of Brexit in a new film from a British perspective and it will be due to the reader's reading of Johnny English's action: Comedy Sales Contract - which was first launched in 2003 on the Johnny Show in England and was sown in 2011 in Johnny and England.
Can Tang in Chick be a reflection on how the country's new export prospects are showing us to be a dirty mess?
With no measure, pop-aid, rubber-fronted flowering, John England is renewed for a second time to cook things: the most obvious thing about this suit is that it's for non-native cinema audiences.
He is indeed a pointless spy, although he is a bit more close to the closet in a simulated and confusing way: the spirit and brotherhood of Mr. Bean, and a small contribution to the Charities of Fire theme at the opening of the 2012 London Olympics.
It was originally played in a now-forgotten barclayscreen television commercial based on the mysterious, unkempt traveller Atkinson, sparking much controversy before it began.
There will be one or two good times on this new G.I. tour.
I loved it when johnny england was standing next to her helicopter with her medieval belt and helmet-facing carrier knife.
Atkinson's body is being visited by a comedic gift, but the fun is particularly less intense and less deep than those of 007 and Mission Impossible, which are more than comedic than comedy enthusiasts.
The entertainment industry seems to be focused on children, not adults, and Johnny English's confused confusion in the Atkinson silent film The Pigs, as seen in Persona of Bean.
The current recurring theme is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber breach has broken into a tightly-held web of British spy networks, exposing the identities of British spies on the ground, to the point of shocking the under-representative spy, Wayne Kevin Eldon, at work.
The last straw for the arrogant and undefeated prime minister, especially for the man whose political agenda is losing, Emma Thompson has done her best to portray the fictional character of Theresa May, but nothing works on the plot.
The intelligence consultant has been injured in every intelligence operation, so she must bring a retired person.
That is to say, confused John England himself, now the headmaster of a rich school, but the lesson he gives is how to be a secret spy, some good bosons say, England has a rock-like school of intelligence here.
England were sent back to White Hall for an emergency where they were able to reconnect with their previous and much-troubled assistant, Boeh, who was played again by Ben Miller.
Boh is now married, attached to a sailor, and has a beautiful hockey stick role, which will lead to Vicky Pepedine.
So all the hard-core intelligence issues of Batman and Robin's Queen have been re-examined in the case of the resumption of the conspiracy against Olga Kuraylekon's beautiful fem Fatale Ofelan Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is risking his fall into the hands of a tech billionaire and promising to solve British computer problems, as seen by Jack Lassie, played by the wealthy Jason Volta.
England and Boh began their journey in a busy hot spring, burning a French restaurant as a guest, embarking on a luxury ship called the Volta, and escaping from the British inland, while Virtual Reality tried to use headphones to introduce itself to the interior of the Volta house.
All stops for the final series are definitely off, but the situation is generally similar to a small children's TV as it is popular and hot.
What my skin is not overwhelmed with:
And I can't stop cooking about other John B. England films, can the British film industry not just do justice by giving Rowan Atkins the role he deserves?
Leiber denied the allegations that he worked four days a week but was working on a five-day pay plan.
Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party had left and was considering a plan for the British to work four days a week, but that the pay would be five days.
The party is said to want the time savings from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to be spent by the company's bosses giving employees one more day off.
employers will see three days of weekends, but they will still take home the same pay.
The sources said the idea was in line with the party's economic agenda and that it planned to upgrade the country in a way that benefits workers.
The trade union union union has approved a four-day shift to benefit workers from the dynamic economy.
A longtime Labour Party source told the Sunday Times that a policy review is expected to be released before the end of the year.
"Not at once, but the four-day workweek is a hoped-for success for the party to rebalance the economy in support of the workers and the overall industrial leader plan of the party.
Given the Green Party's four-day workweek pledging during the 2017 election campaign, this will not be the first time the Labour Party has made public this proposal.
the hope of success, however, is not currently fully developed by the labour party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Four days of work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow chancellor john mcdonell used last week's labor meeting to explain his vision of a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr McDonnell said that the non-nominal executives and non-profit shareholders in the charitable organizations will be removed from power.
It makes sense that Shadow Chancellor's plans are not likely to allow current shareholders in water companies to recover their full stake because the Labour government could make cuts due to illegal activity.
It also confirmed plans to include employees in company boards and create ownership resources that will include 10 percent of the share price of private sector companies, up to £500 per year of dividends in the employee's pocket.
Lidsley Graham told 60 Minutes News that the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for the Supreme Court bench by at least a week, and the office's findings may lead to any Republican senators being backed.
In an interview on Sunday, news anchor Scott Pelley asked Republican senators if the FBI could find anything that would change the minds of John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham.
Kennedy seemed more clear than his South Carolina friend.
I'm right, I'm right, Kennedy.
i thought i was going to hear testimony, i thought i was going to talk to judge kavanagh
after this happened, i called him, and there was a charge of guilt, did you do it?
he was determined, determined, and uncompromising in his decision.
however, the grammar sound seems too difficult or impossible to change.
my mind has decided on brett kavanagh and he will accept a charge that could cause trouble.
"I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was adamant, and Graham added, citing Christine Blasey Ford.
and he couldn't verify any of the people you call by name.
he is 36 years old.
i see nothing new changing.
What is the global city festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the annual Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event celebrating the most exciting star collections and the world's most exciting mission to end poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global City Festival brings tens of thousands of people together at the Central Park Great Lowe not only to entertain Yanis like Janet Jackson, Cardi B. Ina and Shawn Mendez, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival is part of the Global Poverty Project, a non-profit group that believes it can end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty, as it left in 2012.
To receive the free ticket of the festival (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the participants of the festival had to complete a series of small works or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or other meaningful goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is global city, failing to achieve its goal in 12 years?
Is it the right way to convince people to watch a show for free, or is it "clicktivism" because people seem to make a real difference by posting online complaints or tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported more than 19 million "engagements" from its supporters, prompting it to set various goals.
It said these actions have prompted the commitment of world leaders and the development of policies worth $37 billion that could affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 work-related executions and announcements, and at least $10 billion was paid or raised in grants.
The group estimates that the money raised will affect the world's population of up to 649 million.
Among the key achievements, the Food Power, a U.K.-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs, pledged $35 million to help Rwanda address nutritional deficiency after 4,700 tweets from global citizens "help children develop their full potential".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we are making history with malnutrition and social inequality", Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the public on Live London in April 2018.
After more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and babies in the U.K., the government announced that it will fund the Power of Nutrition project, which affects more than 5 million mothers and babies.
In response, a FAQ website asks, "What motivated you to end extreme poverty?"
the world's citizens respond: "it's going to be a long and difficult road: sometimes we fall and fall.
But, like the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements that have come before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among those presenting at this year's Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman show in New York.
Russia could use its navy to "block" the export of energy: Interior spokesman
Washington could turn to its navy to protect Russian energy markets, including the Middle East, "if necessary", US Interior Spokesman Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has made clear her Russian intervention in Syria - and said she is working under the auspices of the legitimate government - as an excuse to find a new energy market.
"I believe the reason they entered the Middle East was to force the momentum, just as Eastern Europe did in the southern belly of Europe", he reported.
and, from the perspective of the authorities, there are ways and methods to deal with the situation.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that, through our Navy, sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to close and prevent their energy supply from entering the market", he said.
Zinke was making clear to the audience at an event organized by the Energy Users Union, a charity group in the US that calls itself "the voice of energy users".
He went on to compare Washington's negotiating approach to Russia and Iran, considering that they have been similar in performance.
"Iran and Russia's alternative to the economy is to reduce, forcibly and replace oil", he said, referring to Russia's economy as "only dependent on fossil fuels".
The announcement came as the Trump administration replaced Russia with a mission to expand the export of melted natural gas, the cheapest option for European consumers.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuccessful" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which in Trump's view will make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly informed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to about 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington's strong dispute over the project is simply due to economic reasons and unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy pressure cannot be a way of delivering and that the opposition should choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Navy spokesman Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US opinion has faced strong opposition from Germany, reaffirming its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of Industries, the leading industry organization in Germany, BDI, has called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement in Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a member of the Massachusetts legislature, said she would take "a hard look" at running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts legislator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "take a hard look" at running for president following her midterm election.
at the holyoke, massachusetts convention hall, she confirmed her intention to compete.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and rebuild our broken state, including the women at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"after october 26, i will consider running for president".
"He's steering the country in the wrong direction", Warren said in a speech to President Donald Trump in the White House.
"I'm so upset about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren expressed her feelings about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, in her criticism.
"We need FBI investigators right before the election", Warren tweeted on Friday.
The census released on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think she will run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "maybe" voters say members of the Massachusetts Legislature should not compete, according to a Suffolk University Center for Policy Research/Boston Globe poll.
thirty-two percent supported such a competition.
The opinion polls showed strong support for former governor Deval Patrick's race, with 38 percent supporting the race and 48 percent opposing it.
Another high-profile Democratic 2020 contest has been highlighted by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont legislator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his official decision in january, the associated press reported.
Sarah Palin quoted Track Palin's PTSD at a political rally by Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the recruitment.
arrested and charged in a civil unrest on Monday night
"I can relate what my son is spending, what he is spending after he returns, to other families who are experiencing PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are bringing back", she told a political gathering in Tulsa, Oklahoma, attended by Donald Trump.
Palin called his prison "the elephant in the room" and said of her and other returnees, "they came back a little changed, they came back hard, they came back their military friends and air force, and all the other members of the armed forces, admiring the honor they have given to the country".
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, Wasilla was arrested in Alaska on Monday and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 States, D.C. support the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting the new U.S. policy to impose legal pressure on a group of criminals or domestic violence fugitives.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a court filing in support of the asylum seeker challenging the policy in Washington on Friday.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace V. Sessions complained that the American Civil Liberties Union's August objection to federal policy was not disclosed.
She claimed that her friend and a boy from a gang had committed a brutal act, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
he was imprisoned in texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, face continuing problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy has been a key factor in the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allows unregistered migrants to flee domestic violence and apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, District Attorney General Carl Ressen called the new policy "a decade of disregard for state, federal and non-compliance law".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be heard according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a ban violates that principle".
The lawyers also argued that immigration bans are a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs and provide "necessary energy" as they hurt the U.S. economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered judges in the refugee case to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic violence and organized crime.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of fear of persecution or because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular community group or political opinion", said Jeff Sessions in a policy statement on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems -- the problems that people face all the time in the world -- even all the worst problems.

US ambassador accuses China of propaganda and intimidation.
A week after a four-page advert promoting U.S.-China trade mutual interests launched an official Chinese newspaper in a daily U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using American publications to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the issue of China's denial of the claim that China sought to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, after last Wednesday's announcement that the state's best-selling newspaper, De Monre Register, was paid for by China's Daily.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections have marked a new stage in Washington's growing pressure campaign against China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote business, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a dirty trade war that has led to round-trip taxes on each of the entries.
China's early-war trade tax retaliation was designed to hurt shippers in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Former longtime Iowa governor Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was harming American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling its threat by publishing propaganda ads in our own independent publications", Bransstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sundays of the Month Regis.
To spread the propaganda, the Chinese government is using the US-regarded culture of free speech and free publishing to issue paid advertisements on the De Mon Registry.
"In comparison, the newspaper and magazine stores in Beijing are the only ones that have limited opposition and show no real reflection of the Chinese people's differing views on China's troubled economic course, given that the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party", they wrote.
He added that he refused to accept the request of one of China's most prominent newspapers to publish the article, not asking which newspaper it was.
Republicans are dismissing female voters before the middle of their term of office, critics warn, because of the cavannah's fall
Despite questions about the alleged sexual abuse of Attorney General candidate Brett Kavanaugh, many of the great Republicans have warned that their stand and defense will face negative reaction, especially from women, during the midterm elections.
The sentiment is very high, and most Republicans are clearly showing a strong interest in pushing for the vote.
"We can't go back to those things", Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill newspaper.
Riker suspects that the last-minute pressure of FBI investigations by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) is enough to scare angry voters.
"Women don't forget yesterday: they won't forget tomorrow", said Karen Jean Pierre, a former adviser and national spokeswoman for the Movement for November, according to The Washington, D.C. Post.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted together, "November is coming!" and during a peaceful demonstration at the entrance to the Senate Hall, the Republican Legal Translators Committee voted to push for Kavanagh's candidacy despite the promise of testimony.
"The deepest interest and motivation for democracy will disappear from the registration table", political analyst Stu Rosenberg, who is not a member of any political party, told the News Site.
people say it has already risen, and that is true.
But it can be especially high among female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, who live in outlying areas and who do not vote often, even though they do not like the president.
Ford's public testimony before the Attorney General, which details sexual assault charges, suggested that a strong negative reaction from critics could follow, with Republicans approving it earlier.
"This has become a cumulative problem for GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, reported NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the Kavanaugh seat, but the way the Republicans have held it and handled her", Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news site.
However, after the testimony of ford and cavannah, americans seem to be divided into two, with a slight drift into the usual.
The new Yogov voting process shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony in a certain or assumed way, and 35 percent believe Kavanagh in a certain or assumed way.
In addition, 38 percent of the cavannahs believe that they lied when they testified in a certain or certain way, and only 30 percent said the same about ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges against Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Legal Translators Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez accuses the attorney general candidate of exposing her penis during a party at Yale in the 1980s.
The global web developer plans to launch a new internet to merge Google and Facebook.
Tim Barnes-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a new business that seeks to merge Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology giant project, Inrapt, is an open source platform from Barnes-Line, a company that is increasingly developing solid on its existing platform.
Solid enables users to choose where to store their information and which people are allowed to use what information.
In an interview with Fast Company alone, Barnes-Lee joked that the interest behind Inerupt is global dominance.
"We need to work now", he said of the new business model.
It is a historic moment.
The implementation allows people to use their own personal Internet data storage or solid technology pod.
may include credentials, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music museum, and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all at the same time.
What makes a private online data store special is the complete choice of the user to use any data.
The company calls this data-driven self-empowerment.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrapt is to help the company make SOID accessible to everyone by bringing the properties, processes and relevant practice knowledge.
The company currently includes Burners-Line, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, a community of contracted employees and licensed computer software developers to build the project.
Starting this week, tech giants around the world can create standalone applications using tools on Inrapt websites.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not discuss with Facebook and Google that they should and should not discuss the full change to their business model at once.
we do not ask their permission. 
In a post on Saturday's Medium, Barnes-Levy wrote that Inrapts' mission is to provide business power and an ecosystem that helps maintain the consistency and quality of the new Web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which completely transformed the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the Adlow-free debate on the Internet.
While launching Inrapt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am curiously excited about the next era". - Berners-Lee.
Bernard van: Victorian priest of the 1st century honored
The city has been honoured for 100 years by the only Church of England priest to receive the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I.
The Reverend Le/C. Bernard Van was awarded the prize for the attack on 29 September 1918 on Belenglis and Leconcort.
but he never knew that he had won the british crown of war, having been killed by snipers four days later.
A gemstone was found by his two sons in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One grandson, Michael Vann, said the stone was "a marvelous symbol" and was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning adventure.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Le/C Vann led his army through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "under heavy gunfire and heavy field and automatic fire".
He quickly went to the field shooting alone and, after hitting three quarters, "with great bravery" he rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward.
Le/Co Vann was shot dead by German Almo on 24 September 1911 - a month before the end of the war.
Michael van, 72, says: "I know I'll never have anything, but it was a humbling thing".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath at a military parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of the military parade" and added: "The true heroic adventure is being shown by the support of a large crowd.
MMA fans have been up all night watching Bellator 206, but have found Peppa Pig instead
think about it, they've been up all night watching bellator 206 together.
The San Jose arrival contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK that evening.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, viewers in the UK were shocked when the broadcast turned into Peppa Pig.
some were especially unhappy with the game after they stayed up late.
One fan described the transformation into a children's cartoon on Twitter as "a little unhealthy joke".
"At 6 a.m. that content is not appropriate and should be turned into a children's program, which is a government regulation", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, you can't take it", said abbey.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work forward to include UK viewers in their agenda.
"I think when i think about the answer game, i think maybe we can fix it.
"but it's six o'clock on sunday and we can't fix this until sunday, our time, their time on monday.
but we're working on it.
believe me, when it was copied, there were many texts going here and there and not all of them were friendly.
we were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
but it wasn't. it was a government matter.
i can promise you, not next time.
We're going to lower it from six to five games, like we often do, and we're going to try and beat the fans more.
It is sad"
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lower' about sex
Olympic champion Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it was his motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he entered high school that "everyone is like him".
The first 4 Desert Island Discs radio said that speaking about gay rights gives "hope" to others
he also said that being a parent has helped him to reduce his anxiety about winning the olympics.
Kirsty young, a full-time long-distance runner, took months off due to illness.
After being fired from Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lower" than all the teenagers because "loving both boys and girls was not acceptable in the community".
"To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and those feelings of being different, were the real things that gave me the strength and the strength to win", he said.
he wants to prove that there was "something", so when they learned about his sexuality, he said, he didn't upset everyone.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known LGBT competitor and uses the theme to denounce homosexuality as a crime in more countries at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He spoke publicly because he felt lucky to be able to live without... - he said he was lucky to be able to live without... - and he wanted to give "hope" to others.
"I was surprised", said Dustin Lance Black, a three-time world champion with a man in 2013 - a US filmmaker who fell in love with him.
Daley said last year he married the biggest Oscar winner of his 20s but the age difference was never controversial.
"To go through all this at this young age", he says - his first Olympics was at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it was difficult to find anyone of his age who had the same experience.
In may, the couple became parents to a son named robert ray black: daley, and daley said "the whole picture has changed".
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been just 'I want a gold medal.'"
"you know, there are bigger things than an olympic gold medal.
my olympic gold medal is robbie".
his father, robert, died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 40.
Daley refused to accept his father's death and said one of the last things he asked - he wanted to be a front-runner - was that he had their ticket to London 2012.
"I could not tell my father that he would not live with us to be a hero", he says.
"I held his hand when the breathing stopped and I made sure that it was not until the breathing stopped and he died that he was finally able to breathe", he said.
The following year, daley competed in the 2010 olympics and won bronze.
"But I realized that I was not that old: to go to the olympics in front of a crowd, there is no better feeling", he said.
He sparked his first musical choice: Proud was dating him at the Heather Small-for-the Olympics event and still makes a splash.
Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was fired, was replaced in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson is set to make a mark in his 47th Ryder Cup race on Sunday, but he must change his stance to avoid anything unpleasant.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th consecutive biennial tournament, was replaced by Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-match match.
Instead of being a game-changer, as was the case with the united states, the five-time winner divided his time into support and preparation for the game to relieve his anxiety.
Even those who went undefeated did not climb the tower he reached during his playing days, the 48-year-old is not fit for the heavy national course of Le Golf, which is often difficult to repair.
And if the pitch itself is not enough to disappoint, for the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson will face strong British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
The Americans, who started 12 games with 4 points below, could prove the importance of the Mickelson game if they don't start with a strong offense.
furyk expressed confidence in himself, not saying much more.
"He's fully understood the role now, he'll be ready for tomorrow after he hits my back and puts his arm on me", furyk said.
"he has a deep confidence in himself.
He's great, he added a lot to the team last week, and he did this week.
I didn't think it would add two games.
I've been thinking a lot, but that's the way it is, and we thought we should go that way.
like everyone else, he wants to be there".
Mickelson has passed the mark of Nick Faldo in Sunday's game for most Ryder games.
he could have ended his playing days in the ryder cup game, as he never matched his own glory.
Mickelson has won 18 times, with 20 draws and 7 draws, but his presence has brought the team unseen, Furyk said.
"It's funny, it's confusing, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny, and it's great to have him in the group", he explained.
"the young players were very excited to play with him this week, we are sad to see that.
"It is more than just a game".
Europe's leading Thomas Bjorn knows that multi-diversity leadership will soon be gone
As Thomas Bjorn of Europe has learned from his experience, the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
Dane made his debut for Valderrama in 1997, when he won the match by a narrow margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2 despite a five-point lead over the Americans by Seve Ballesteros.
"Remember yourself that we were leading the way at Valderrama; if we lost, we were leading the way at Brookline, and we won the way at the little Valderrama", Bjorn said, after watching the 2018 graduates beat 5-3 Friday and yesterday and lead the national Le Golf.
so the story shows that this did not happen to me and all the members of my team.
tomorrow you will be able to do everything you can.
go out there and do all the right things.
the story is not over until you find their numbers on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win the trophy, and that's what it's all about.
I've said it all together - I'm focusing on our 12 players on our side, but we also know that there are some of the world's greatest players on that side".
He was impressed with the quality of the players in the tough golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I never used myself in this.
tomorrow is not another day.
tomorrow is a personal experience, and that is something different to do.
When things go well, it's great to be with that partner, but when you're alone there, you're able to play golf to your full potential.
That's the message you have to give all the players, get your best tomorrow.
now leave your partner behind, and let him go and do the same, and let him prove himself worthy".
With the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points in the group, unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than they did together.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the big changes, eventually being part of the Brooklyn winning team before losing when Europe "miracle Medinah" was elevated.
I remember every word, says Ben Crenshaw in 1999, in response to a question about how you gathered the players who were heading for the final day.
"we have 12 crucial matches tomorrow, but you better get rid of that quick start like you saw in brooklyn, medinah.
when the ball moves in one direction, only the middle of the game is pressured.
we've organized our route accordingly and we've put the people in the shape we feel, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas was given the opportunity to try out for the replay and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter respectively, and other Europeans in the top half.
"I went with this group player in this order because I thought it would cover all the way in", Bjorn said of his single selection.
The new German warship was once again extended
The German Navy's fastest warship was to be implemented in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war warship, but due to the deteriorating systems and rising costs, it will not be available until at least next year, local media reported.
The entry into service of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fastest warship, the "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been extended to mid-2019, according to a military spokesman for Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was to join the navy in 2004, but the difficult post-volunteer issue caused the project to slow down.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class fast cruisers.
It is known to have powerful firepower, anti-aircraft and anti-ship launching capabilities, and some stealth technology such as small radar, light bulb and sound signatures.
Other important aspects include long maintenance times: the new fast warship must be able to be deployed from home port up to two years away.
However, the continuing delay meant allowing references to the German Navy's fleet of battleships: they would be outdated as soon as they entered service, Die Zeit noted.
The F125 fast cruiser was a headline story last year when German naval officials withdrew the ship from use and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
this was the first time the navy had returned to the shipbuilder after the ship was delivered.
The reason behind the return is not known, but German media cited critical "software and hardware failures" that would make the ship worthwhile if it were to engage in a war zone.
The lack of software was particularly important for the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship to be able to carry 120 sailors, half the manpower needed for the fastest warship of the old Bremen class.
The ship was found to be incredibly heavy, which reduced its capacity and prevented it from increasing its naval capacity.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of the same ship used by the Germans in World War II.
Alongside the corrupt hardware, the overall cost of the project - including training sailors - is becoming a concern.
The start-up has reportedly risen from €2.2bn to a staggering €3.1bn ($3.6bn).
The problems surrounding the new fast warship have become necessary, especially with the recent warning of the German Navy's decline in capability.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, announced that the navy was indeed "exhausting vessels eligible for mercenary service".
The official said the case was increasing steadily, as the old ships stopped working but no replacement ships were provided.
he lamented that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fast warships could join the navy.
The National Deaf Listener on the Secret Life of Birds Every Night
A new study is underway in the Scottish Highlands to explain how the birds use the landscape for food.
The discovery is believed to shed new light on the unique nature of the flying mammal and is expected to lead to future conservation efforts.
The most common and loudly heard pipistrelles, as well as the brown-eared and Daubenton lily, are followed by those in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross, for study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland.
special recorders are usually placed around key areas to monitor the movement of the night-bird during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers conduct mobile surveys using hand-held indicators.
The professional sound analysis of all audio records confirms the frequency of the call of the night owl and what species is doing.
a map and a report of the life cycle are prepared to create a detailed picture of the celestial-earth image.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat is most important for bats and which species are used.
This information will help to identify the benefits of wildlife management such as green field work and better conservation of wild birds and related species.
The number of bats has declined sharply in Scotland and across the UK over the past century.
They are in danger of destroying sheds and man-made life due to construction and development.
wind turbines and lightning can be dangerous, such as leaflets and certain building materials, as well as attacks by cats.
the lilies are not blind.
but their ears are more valuable than their eyes when it comes to hunting their food because of their hunting experience at night.
they use a sophisticated method of searching for souls or to identify obstacles in their flight.
NTS takes the nightbirds seriously, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 shielding grounds around Harare.
it has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, check-ups and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only Scottish nesting ground for eight of the ten nesting birds, the nesting ground for the eight nesting birds, at Threave estate Dumfries and Galloway.
The estate manager, David Thompson, said the estate is a suitable state for them.
"we have a good place for birds to sleep in threave", he said.
We have old buildings, old trees and all good zoos.
but there is much that is not known about the lilies, so it helps us to understand better what they need to develop our work here and elsewhere".
He stressed the need to check for the presence of lily birds before carrying out repairs on property. An unintentional destruction of a single parent's cottage could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly the entire population.
The lilies are wild and killing, attacking or disturbing them or taking their nest is a crime.
Elisabeth ferrell, a scottish bird watch officer, as myself, urged the public to come to her aid.
"We still have a lot to learn about our nocturnal birds and know how many of our species are worth counting", she says.
Ronaldo ignored the rape charge when the lawyer prepared to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people were using his name to "promote themselves".
The lawyers are ready to appeal the case against the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese and Juventus striker, Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, was accused of raping a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then reportedly paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
After hours of silence, Ronaldo, 33, told his 142 million followers on Instagram live video, calling the report "fake news".
"no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Today's news, fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
"they want to make themselves known by my name.
It is common
They want to be famous for calling my name, but that's part of the job.
"I am a happy person and everything is fine", the player added with a smile
According to Reuters, "Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the alleged "unacceptable rumors about personal freedom"
"The player demands compensation for the moral failure of the recent serious violation of personal rights, which may have been linked to breach of contract", said lawyer Christian Schertz.
The case was allegedly filed in the Palms Hotel Room and Las Vegas Casino in June 2009.
According to documents filed in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly drove through the clubhouse to a room called the "Buddy Room".
After the trial, Mayorga kneels down and says that Ronaldo is "99 percent" "good" and "one percent" "good"
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex and that they had a mutual agreement
Mayorga also said she went with the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in the hospital, but eventually agreed outside the courtroom "out of fear of revenge" and "not to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old faces a lawsuit and is still upset about her decision to break the agreement
He was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United when the attack occurred, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giants Juve for a €100 million deal.
Brexit (Brexit): UK could 'regret forever' for losing its carmakers
If the UK loses its world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, it could 'regret forever,' said Trade Office chief Greg Clark.
Toyota UK UK UK said it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory in Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal, saying it was "disconcerting" to the BBC
"We need agreement", said mr. clark.
A Japanese automaker says that time travel without a Brexit without a deal could have a job loss
Toyota's Burnaston plant, which produces Auris and Avensis, shipped 90% of the 150,000 cars it produced last year to the European Union, where it was sold.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU by the end of April, it will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about how cross-border business can operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, as they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, is closing its small factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit
According to carmakers, the main concern is supply chain disruption
Toyota's product line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, so order-driven car bags are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on April 29, it could violate border laws, leading to delays and shortening of cargo, industry says.
The company said that it was impossible for Toyota to carry more than the expected amount of goods at the Derbyshire factory, and production could have stopped
"The Palace of Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is to integrate effectively to avoid border checks", Clark said.
"We need agreement. I think we should be happy not only with the success we have but also with the opportunity, so we need a deal that will make it happen", he told BBC Radio 4 today.
"We want to continue the supply chain that was so efficient, as can be seen not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but the increased cost warned that in the long run, the plant could reduce its competitiveness and create jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is chairman of the factory unit, said the members were very concerned: "As I know from experience, once these jobs go, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: "We have made a precise and credible plan for the future of our relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be extended again, the White House said
The White House said Sunday that Donald Trump's lucrative meeting with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be postponed to another week because of ongoing clashes with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of her special adviser, Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, Trump's help and Russian ties and the president's miscarriage of justice.
Trump has been raising alarm about Washington for months, threatening Mueller's freedom, firing the deputy attorney general, and not firing him.
Earlier this month, Rosenstein read in the New York Times that he had wired their conversation during a meeting with Trump and that the president could be removed as a result of the 25th Amendment.
rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, the White House reported that he was going to be released in mid-July.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump on Thursday, after which the United Nations would meet him in New York.
Trump said he would "seek to fire Rosenstein", but the meeting was delayed to avoid potential intimidation with lawmakers, Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, confirmed.
On Friday, at Kavanaugh's request, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation, requiring all members of the legislature to attend.
Trump's chief information officer Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said, "It's not set for that date, it could be this week, and there are things going on in the Supreme Court, so it can be pushed back to another week.
but we will see and I want to keep the media informed when there is something new".
Some reporters may test that confirmation: Sanders has not issued a White House press release since September 10.
producer chris wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of comments was not because she hated "reasonable" TV reporters, but she said: "I agree with the fact that they are".
She then commented on the stronger direct relationship between trump and the media.
Without giving any proof, she added, "The president has had more question and answer sessions than any president before him".
Statements will continue to be made, Sanders said, "but if the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's better than me talking.
We're trying hard to do that, and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks, and you can talk to the president of the United States, and that's part of the press release".
Trump always receives questions when he attends the White House or open meetings or leaves a public meeting with prominent guests.
BCA press conference meetings are few.
This week, the president is seen in New York, showing a confused face before the press and powerlessness of the meeting.
Health spokesman wrote to EU staff at Scotland's NHS about Brexit fears
The health spokesperson thanked the EU staff at the Scottish NHS and encouraged them to continue their work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter to the UK to leave the EU in less than six months.
The Scottish government is committed to meeting the cost of living conditions for citizens working in public services for the EU.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on a withdrawal are ongoing, leading to a decision expected this fall.
But the UK government was also halting the event due to possible disagreements.
i know that you will tell you about the most unstable times for all.
that is why i want to say again and again how much i value the contributions of each of the employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, have brought valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the healthcare sector, and will empower the patient and the community.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before half an hour.
"he came to the corner line and said he was going to fall there", reed explained.
The coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen in a rigid line before she was taken to Karaza for further examination.
Tennessee State officials told Chris Harris that WSMV had been out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, Abercrombie.
Harris also said there is "no specifics on the type/size of the damage" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He was given a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, with 18 tackles for the entire season.
Foreign buyers are subject to higher stamp duty when buying UK property
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy UK property. The additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The movement will reduce the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increased stamp duty will be on those who do not pay UK taxes
The house will be kept in a safe deposit fund that will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are forced to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy UK property - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The movement is seen as an attempt to undermine the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising to provide more affordable housing and targeting higher-income ones.
The increased stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and organisations who do not pay UK taxes, with the additional money to help fight the road-sleeping of the government.
The higher fees than usual - in addition to the current stamp duty - can be up to 3 percent, including the higher rates announced two years ago for second homes and buy-to-lease.
The financial institution expects the activity to rise to £120 million.
About 13 percent of newly built London homes have been purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the stairs.
Many of the rich areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new directive comes two weeks after Boris Johnson reduced the temporary obligation to allow many young residents to have their own homes.
He blamed large construction companies for not taking up space and raising the prices of houses, and urged them to leave a stake in the houses that would have the potential to adjust Britain's "deprived housing system".
Mr Corbyn has introduced a series of planned housing reforms that will appeal to the eye, including rental controls and "destructive evictions".
he wants to give the council the highest authority to build new houses.
"Last year, I was going to resign as prime minister to restore the British dream: that life should be better for every generation", said sister May.
and it means rebuilding our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it is not true that it is easy to buy a house from hardworking british residents, non-british residents, and foreign companies.
for many people, the dream of owning a home was far from real, and the glorious reality of sleeping on the street continues".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate wish is to rule Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "ultimate wish" was to become a Scotland coach at some level.
Scott, 42, is currently in League One, a three-point lower North-East side than the top, making the fight to revive life exciting.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I have won the B Cup", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Voice.
When i was a kid, i grew up with my dad in hampden, scotland, and he always told me something that made me feel better.
this opportunity can come if i succeed in team management.
Ross's replacements include Sunderland coach Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The name, which was previously created after the demise of the towns of Barnsley and Ipswich, has been criticized by the former Alloa Athletic manager for not being a source of anxiety in such a large group.
"My success is measured at this time by 'can i get this team back to the premier league?'
"Because of the structure and supply of this team, it will undoubtedly be in the Premier League", he said.
"it's not an easy task to deliver, but in this case, I think I'm successful only if I can get the team back there".
Ross is only three years into his coaching career, after a 15-month coaching contract with Hearts and a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton.
He then helped Alloa progress from the Reds to third place, and converted St Mirren from the Reds to a winning position the following season.
And Ross said he was now very impressed with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"maybe it was the right crossing", recalled alloa.
i truly felt that coaching was the right fit for me, not just playing.
It seems confusing because i've grown up well, lived a reasonable life, and got some reasonable heights.
but it can be difficult to play.
there are many things you need to go through each week.
I've been overwhelmed by the stress and pressure of the job again, but training has a sense of accuracy.
I always wanted to train and now I'm working, and my whole adult life is the most comfortable I've ever had".

The best time for a bottle of beer is Sunday at 5.30pm, the survey found
The summer heat wave has led to increased revenue for struggling British liquor stores but has put more pressure on restaurants.
Alcoholic drinks groups showed sales growth of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues were down 4.8 percent, figures show
Peter Martin, CGA's business adviser who compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and England's long-awaited World Cup participation mean that July followed a similar frequency of events as last June, except that restaurants were hit more frequently when the bars were up 2.8 percent.
The restaurant business fell 1.8 percent in June, slightly lower in July
The rise of liquor stores and pubs has been higher than the rise of downed restaurants.
food-focused beverage shops, but not as shocking as restaurant operators, have been hit hard.
people seem to just go out for a drink.
In well-managed liquor and alcohol shops, sales of alcohol were up 6.6 percent for the month, with three batches of food down".
"These results will continue as we have seen since the end of April", said RSM Paul Newman, a recreational use and hospitality analyst.
W The impact of climate and mainstream social or sporting conditions remains a major factor in the trend towards sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but the year-on-year drop of 4.8 percent is in addition to the increasing price pressure.
The longest hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-driven business activists, and time tells us that the more moderate temperatures we spent in August gave us a little of the much-needed short respite".

Elide Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Athletics Board.
Elide Doyle was appointed as non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is a Scottish medal-winning track and field athlete and chairman Ian Bitt said her run was a great opportunity for them to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade leading the sport.
"Elid has a strong reputation in Scotland, the UK and the world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish Athletics will benefit greatly from bringing her to the board", said BTT.
"I am looking forward to being the voice of athletes and I hope to make a positive contribution and help lead the sport in Scotland", said Doyle.

An advertisement comparing mothers to lambs breastfeeding device distributes opinions on the Internet
A breastfeeding company compares cows to cows that are breastfeeding
In a launch of what is being called "the world's first silent breastfeeding device", consumer-focused technology company LV has released an announcement featuring a free-to-play music video of the new breastfeeding device for self-expressing mothers.
When four real mothers sing a single song with a poem like that in a melodic rhyme, "Yes, I am, but you can't see my head but you can't see my tail" and "If you don't understand, maybe these are not cow's breasts, these are my breasts".
the man continues: "take it out, take it out, for i am feeding my little ones, take it out, take it out, take it out, I am feeding my wives.
However, the advertisement on the company's facebook page sparked controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of messages, the video received mixed responses, with many calling the animal industry a thriving industry.
"It is a very low decision to use this product to promote it to the masses.
one wrote that they must be nursing and giving birth like us, in order to be fed milk, rather than being stolen by their mother within days of birth.
L.V.'s breast milk is stored in a non-identical hood in the caregiver's breast container (L.V./mother)
Another commented: "It is very disturbing, as you can see, for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk to mothers who should care for their babies?"
Another added: "This kind of outdated advertising"
Others blocked the ad, believing that a woman found the single to be too funny
"i think this is a superior idea.
I would have had one if I had still been breastfeeding
drinking made me feel like a cow.
the ad is a little bit of a shock, but i took it for granted.
"This is the best product", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a humorous ad aimed at mothers who use the toilet (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and who feel like "baby girls".
This is not a commercial that praises the industry or says it's good or bad".
At the end of the video, the women's team announced that they had all been drinking unknown beverages under their bra.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who use breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
However, the LV is completely silent, without wires or tubes and is unknowingly placed under the custodian's breastplate, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and use the lvl to go outside.
Anna Ballarin, founder of Mazer and ECD, comments: "LV drinking is a revolutionary product that requires a bold and angry start.
We wanted to bring breastfeeding and all its offences to the public's attention by creating a line between self-expressing women and dairy cows, and then to show the incredible sense of freedom that the new breastfeeding will bring in a fun and engaging way.
when an LV is taking a facelift, it's not the time to start.
During london fashion week, a mother of two appeared on the fashion show stage of designer martha jacubovsky using the product.
Hundreds of refugee children have been safely moved to a camp on the border of texas.
The number of detained refugee children has peaked, but monthly restrictions remain unchanged, as the Trump administration's policies and policies have made it more difficult to accept children with bail.
In practice, most of the refugees themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear that when they are approached to ask for a child, they will be at risk of their ability to stay in the country.
The threat was compounded in June when federal authorities announced that they would be given a bail bond and other senior family members would be required to give fingerprints and that the information would be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, a former immigration and customs official, Matthew Albenes, testified that the agency had detained more than a dozen people who claimed to be the only guarantors of children who had not yet arrived in the country.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"80 percent of the individuals who are inmates or members of the inmates' families have entered the country illegally, and most of them are criminals from other parts of the world.
so we will continue to follow these individuals", said mr. albanes.
According to shelter worker, in an effort to speed up the process of the children, the authorities introduced new rules requiring that some of the children be brought to court within a month of detention instead of 60 days after the usual procedure.
Many of them go to the immigration judge to appeal their case to the legal level, not in person, via video conference call.
those who are not considered to meet the requirements are quickly expelled from the country due to the threat.
According to reports from Shelter and the Center, the longer the prison term, the more likely the children are to become anxious or sad, leading to attempts to escape and escape.
advocates say that such concerns are highlighted by the fact that a child struggling with a mildness is more likely to be ignored than a tornado.
many add that allowing children to move to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can aggravate the turbulent situation they are struggling with.
Syria to the US, French and Turkish occupying forces: immediately withdraw
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mo'allam also called for Syrian refugees to return home, but the country is now in its eighth war.
Moallam, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the presence of foreign forces on Syria's soil was an excuse to fight terrorism and that it would be adequately addressed.
"The ban must be lifted immediately and without conditions", he told the audience.
Moallem insists that the war on terrorism in Syria has ended since 2011, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced.
Damascus says it will continue to fight this holy war until it clears all Syrian states of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign bodies.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.

The united states and the european union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish an Idlib Free Peace Zone, the last major stronghold of the insurgents, provided an opportunity to pressure the political speeches.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has sparked a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the three-million-strong region.
However, MOALOM has pointed out that the agreement has a definite deadline and hopes that the military action will target militants, including the militants of the Nusra Front, who are completely destroyed by the religion and have ties to al-Qaeda.
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes a new committee of government and opposition will soon hold its first meetings to push for a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
MOALOM, the forum's work: The Committee on the Intervention of the Syrian Government has set out the conditions for its participation, saying that the revision of the current constitution should be restricted and warned against interference.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
According to the theory, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, and as many liberal thinkers may hope, power crunch and illegal acts will shortly expose him to the presidency.

It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th largest bankruptcy is back in its former position, thanks to congressional districts that have placed two seats in a single-seat band competition.
This newly reconstituted Pittsburgh suburb will put Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb, who won another district seat in a special election last spring, in the race.
Lamb is currently competing with incumbent Republican Keith Rosefuss, who is currently representing the new 17th District, which covers most of the former 12th District of Pennsylvania.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled on Jan. 1 that the previous districts had changed their boundaries to the advantage of Republicans in a way that violated the constitution.
The new campaign for the 17th edition has led to a fierce competition between the main party sponsors, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), which has been held since November.
Lamb became a household name in pennsylvania after narrowly winning the special election for pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in march.
That seat had been held by a republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
political analysts have given the democrats a narrow grip.
the united states el salvador has been sanctioned for supporting china and has been excused.
Diplomats stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing despite some US pressure.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm relationship with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the coalition's founders expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Heather North, a spokesman for the Department, said in a statement earlier this month that the State Department officials decided to call US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Taiwan because of their decision not to recognize the country.
But sanctions were only intended for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in development and economic aid, including drug control, in 2017.
The increase in the reduction of financial aid and the targeted visa restrictions could cause a detrimental level of high unemployment and suicide rates in the Central American country.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level meeting of officials focused on security and economic prosperity to monitor the same meeting last year, which was supposed to have delayed efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go ahead and that any sanctions against El Salvador could be effectively eliminated.
Vice President Mike Pence has now been selected to address a conference scheduled for mid-October, highlighting the administration's implications for the summit.
And the three US ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
Mr. Bolton, a White House spokesman, declined to comment on the list of disputes, including two diplomats who agreed to keep internal talks secret.
An analyst who spoke to a government official outside the government who did not reveal his name confirmed their accounts.
What is the meaning of life?
The next possible addition is the report of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now a major public record holder, and has a lot of evidence that Mr. Trump is an obstacle to achievable justice.
Mr. Mueller is, according to some, turning his investigation to investigate whether Mr. Trump's campaign has secretly agreed with Russia to attack our elections.
If the Congress changes its position, as he prepares to appear before the electorate, Mr. Trump will face personal responsibility, and possibly ultimately the jury's verdict.
That's a lot, and Mr. Trump's failure is not suggesting that he's going to have his own tracks in Europe.
There are options for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.

Rosenstein had been in serious trouble last year after the newspaper reported that the president had suggested secretly and considered it unsuitable for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the timeline is accurate.
"What would be our response if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanagh was not complete or balanced or if the Supreme Court confirmed the allegations of sexual assault and false testimony without the words?
And most importantly, will we vote for the congressional election that holds Mr. Trump accountable for the half-term?
if we fail these challenges, democracy will have reason to wait a long winter.

Ranger graham dorrance is expected ahead of the viennese race.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, believing a victory over Austria, following the exciting match against Spain's Villarreal earlier this month, would put them on a strong footing to break through Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrance from his first game of the season until he was tied 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger things.
"I had a good point because Vlarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the competition because we believed we would get something and we won with a point.
we might have finally put it in, but overall the peer-to-peer ratio was probably a good one.
Maybe they were better in the first half, and we went to goalton in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another big European night.
With all hope, we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they finally got a good result, but I'm sure the spectator will push us from behind and we'll get a positive result.
last year was definitely a tough year, because of all the things that happened between my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is something about the place that makes me feel good.
The team is good and the kids are really loving it, and the practice is good.
with hope, we can leave the past behind, move forward, and we will succeed".

although the survey participants had a clear understanding of how they needed to be treated, few people spoke to their family members about the matter.
In a global survey, nearly half of people say they talk about long-term care with their spouse.
only 10 percent said they had conversations with their children.
"People want their family members to take care of them, but they are not taking steps to do so", said Holly Snyder, CEO of the International Life Insurance Business.
It starts here:
talk to your spouse and children: if you do not prepare for what you want in advance, you will not be able to plan for the future care of your family.
discuss with your counselor where and how to get care, as these choices will help you to measure the costs involved.
Bring your financial advisor, who can help you find a way to make money for payments.
For long-term care fund options, traditional long-term care insurance policies may include a mixed-money-payable life insurance policy to cover these expenses, or a trust in your own property as long as you have the funds.
Keep your legal documents in order: Keep legal disputes out of bounds
If you are in a situation where you cannot speak, have your chosen trusted person provide a healthcare document to monitor the medical care process and to provide the professionals with the necessary care as you specify.
and make a financial lawyer available
If the capacity is low, they can choose a person they trust for financial decisions and ensure that all their payments are paid.

Federal investigators are calling for the death penalty for suspected terrorists in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saypov, the man responsible for the terrorist attack that killed eight people: such a special punishment has never been a federal crime since 1953.
Syapov, 30, committed the act in October using a rental car on the Lower Manhattan West Highway, injuring motorists and pedestrians on the road.
According to the death penalty notice in the southern state of New York, to be sentenced to death, investigators must prove that Sipov purposely intended the act to cause "intentional" serious bodily harm.
both cases will have the capacity to issue a death sentence according to court documents.
A week before the attack, the Federal Supreme Court charged Saipov with 22 counts of commonly used felony, eight counts of murder and violation of the law and damage to motor vehicles.
The researcher said the attack was "a long-term plan and preparation", which he described as "very cruel and cruel".
The case file " Sayfullo Habiblayevich Saypov has allegedly killed and injured the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angel, Nicholas Cleaves, Hiran Ferrucci, Hiran Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagunco.
The five victims were visitors from argentina.
It has been ten years since the southern district of new york last handled a death sentence.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in the federal case in New York was in 1953, when Jules and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were sentenced to death for helping the Soviet Union obtain information two years ago during the Cold War.
Both rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on july 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbek citizen, Saipov, said he did not regret the last days of the attack.
According to the police, he said he had no regrets about his work and felt good.
After watching videos on his phone of an ISIS terrorist group, Sappov told investigators that he was inspired to carry out the attack.
Police said in the hospital room, he asked for the ISIS terrorist group's flag to be hung on him.
he pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
The federal public prosecutor, David Patton, representing Saipov, said he was deeply saddened by the verdict.
Paton said that asking for the death penalty would be an extension of mental disorder for anyone involved in the process rather than a life sentence without parole.
Saypov's opposition group had earlier asked his lawyers not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory MP has asked Nigel Farage to sit in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has chosen to mobilize the people's army during the conference protests in Tory.
Former Ukip leader, Theresa May, has suggested that she be in charge of EU negotiations to listen to the heat from the e-spectra.
If Mr Farage was Brexit secretary, the UK would still be out, said Peter Bon March Burningham, a long-term watchdog.
The challenge for Ms. May, however, is to reconcile the divided levels deeply and to identify the main Tories who joined the protest against the city of Brexit.
The key is to work to get the authorities, the rest and the EU to agree on the future exposure prevention plan.
In contrast to the failed plan, the partners said that it would seek to reach an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and the worker to choose between itself and the problem.
Mr. Bone said the release meant leaving the assembly in Solihull to check the checks.
Mr. Fraj urged attention and responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have left at this hour,' he said.
Wellinborough MP increased, but we are going to raise the Brexit bill for Chuck Checker.
He opposed the A.H. and said, as he said, we will not participate in the world war.
we must respect our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bon has destroyed the public opinion that has changed since the 2016 election: the British people want to remain silent and remain silent.
Tory Brexit leader andrew jenkins is out in november, according to reporters: "i am simply saying, prime minister, listen to the people.
The Chechens are not popular with the public, they are not elected by the opposition, and this is not known why our party and activists make us the first to be elected.
Please leave the checkers and listen.
A message to Mr May, he added, "The prime minister is keeping his word.
Mr Farage told politicians: "You must feel the heat if you want to win the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust among us - the people - and the political sector.
They were going to betray Brexit and we are telling him today: we will not let them do that.
He has sent a message to the people who are eager to add: "I want you to change our political agenda, I want you to betray me with a Rexit, I want you to feel the heat".
"We are gathering the people's fighters in this city who have won Brexit, we will not rest until we can, we will be self-governing, we are proud of the United Kingdom".
So far, the rest of the marchers have spent two hours in Burningham before they protested in the city centre.
This week, after the group's release, activists have raised Torych's protest against Brexit.
His counterpart lord adonis mocked the conservatives on the issue of security and they began to worry that the conference had begun.
These people have the IT system in place and all the technology in Canada, and it's the border-free, border-free business that has increased.
 It is a complete joke.
there is nothing better than Brexit, it is what makes it better.

Russian legend Lewis Hamilton closed the world record after his team asked Sebastian Vettel to win
Valteri Place has been playing for Lewis Hamilton at the Marchéades on Saturday, but it has become clear that the team's role in the race is high.

In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly testify to Ford's address before a Senate committee, especially the Senate, to the public about what was happening.
something that can happen and something that is beautiful will stay in the senate for a few days, when you see anger, when you see angry people and there is average and ugly and unbelievable.
when you see those who are released and gone out, they will say, 'oh, I did not do it.
i did not.
Do you remember?
Dianne Festen, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you uncovered the document - oh, oh, what?
oh, no, not at all.
i did not.
wait a minute.
We've been... no, we haven't been. He's been up, drawing the attention of the senator.
Kavanagh was indicted by Ford in February and now in May for not providing evidence in a letter to Fenton, but Fenton refused to leave her office.
I didn't hide it. Ford's case, I didn't reveal the story.
she asked me to keep him secret, and i kept him secret.
Her refusal was not addressed by the president, who spoke at the meeting on Saturday night: "What can I tell you, this is bad human language.
she may not have done it, but what i saw was the ugly language of listening.
The Supreme Court continues to debate, accusing three women of sexual assault, the president said the Democrats are bringing charges against themselves.
they have decided to reassert authority in no form.
you see the mediator, the ugly, it's not their business who gets hurt, it's their business who they control to get power.

The woman was burned at the stake by the nighttime reports of the spies
The case of the man who seriously burned a Mississippi woman in 2014 has been postponed to Saturday.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has been questioned for hours as an expert witness in the Criminal Investigation Unit.
In the case of the use of a phone record, he was called by a 29-year-old Keynton Teles security guard and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chamber, the night she died.
According to roullett, who collected location information from several phones, chamber was with telis the night she died, denying the possibility of future suspicion, according to the claren legger.
When the information says he was with Chamber, he said he was with my friend Michael Sanford, and the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took his stand on Saturday and confirmed he was not in the city that day.

Another missing thing is that telis has known chamber for two weeks before she died.

The other black man will never be a man, and she wrote to her husband, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman.
however, she sent it to her husband, lieutenant maurice, twice.
After learning, she fired her mother's former Placebo-Flaxman agent, R.E. Morris, citing Nanny, who was African-American, and she did the job of a lockdown and he was a Filipino waiting for her, according to the New York Post.

The future of brett kavanagh will be determined by the fbi's investigation
"I thought if we could find something like what he asked for - the study is limited in time and is limited in scope - we should bring even a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee was different.
Why did mr. kavanaugh and his republican supporters want the fbi to stop doing the survey?
the secret to their success lies in the timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, and in June, the Republicans are expected to be working hard, weakening their electoral lines, and finding a candidate to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up their cell phones to call the senators, and they supported Mr. Kavanaugh to create influence, working for Bush at the White House and through her they met his wife, Achline, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the fbi releases the results?
There will be elections in the senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently seated.
Mr. Kavanaugh is suspected of winning the Senate floor with a small margin of votes, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to break his prison and secure it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean bomber numbers fell below the Kim
Several North Korean destroyers have fallen to South Korea, according to South Korean lawmakers, seven years before Kim Jong-un took office.
Park Byung-siung, the data ministry of the Southern Unity, said there were 1,127 pollutants since last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the top defendants in North Korea and China, which are narrowly defined, are the contraband traders who play the most important role.
Pyongyang has not commented on any public opinion.
Many North Koreans have gained South Korean citizenship from immigrants.
More than 30,000 South Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the 1953 war.
Many flights are through China, the longest border with China to Korea and this is the simplest from the most covert military blockade (DMZ) of the two Koreas.
China is returning these migrants to their countries, not as refugees, but as illegal migrants.
relations between the south and the north - both in a state of war in his career - have changed in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to agree on a deal focused on eliminating nuclear power.
This comes after a historic visit in Singapore in February by President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who also agreed to create a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US law enforcement for the wrongdoing.
"No confidence in the US, no confidence in our national security, no reason to put ourselves first", Mr. Re told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called brett kavanagh a historical, he is not qualified to serve in the supreme court.
The head of the lower house, nancy pelosi, called the supreme court brett kavanagh and said he was a hysterical and unfit to serve in the supreme court.
He commented on the interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Pelozzi, Texas, on Saturday.
I can't help you but think if a woman did that, Pelosi, who was called "hysterical", testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Kavanaugh's actions.
Kavanaugh emotionally opposed the allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a child.
In the opening speech, kavanaf was emotional, crying and busy during his family and high school years discussing.
The committee criticized Democrats, charged him with aggravated murder and conspiracy, and was led by angry liberals who were angry that Hillary did not run for the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony, assuring him that he should not serve in the supreme court because he put pressure on the democrats.
he has also distanced himself from these speeches and from the clintons and democrats, as he has said.
Pelosi was asked to strike Kavanaugh if he could, and the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm telling you -- he hasn't told the truth to Congress or the FBI, but to be in court, he's here now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added Democrats he was concerned about the possible governance of Kavanaugh's ability.
he confirmed from what he heard, cavanaf is asking for some of the decisions of the supreme court to be reversed.
"It's not a hysterical time, the victim is expected to go to court, not as good", Pelosi said.
and women should practice it.
that's a fair speech, months and years go by, and she can't get through it without crying.
we cry in anger, and i have a wife of 45 years.
"I don't think he's known, do you?"
She goes on, "because I helped a woman who was an executive in a position, and she cried when I was crying, but when we started crying and crying, you could think she was sad to the man she was talking to.
I was angry.
and she continued.
And I thought that was good.
tears may be a source of anger because you have not helped these people from the beginning.
I remember my past work, in a male-dominated office, where I found myself crying, with a tall woman holding a scarf around my neck - a cold manager who always pulled me up the stairs slowly.
"I never saw you crying", he told me.
they will never know that i hate you.
they will be happy to see that they have been moved to feel sorry for you and to come to your son.
Patricia Scurrider, then a Democratic congresswoman, worked with Gray Hart of Colorado on his presidential run.
In addition, Mr Hart, a businessman and foreign boatman with a marriage issue, ran out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, very scared, and found that there was no reason to stop her from running for president.
"That's not a good idea, he laughed at me 30 years later.
There were seven other contestants in the race, and in the end, they wanted another dancer.
the seven stones and the white snow, as men call them.
She said she was late to the campaign, was in the process of raising money, and could not participate until she had earned $2 million.
it was a battlefield.
he knows that her fans give the guys $1,000 but only give him $250.
do they think they have found a way? she asked.
When he announced in his speech that he would not start the usual campaign, he was emotionally drawn - thank you to everyone I supported, fear of the system, so it's hard to raise money and it's what the voters from the representatives get up to, and they get angry about, sexual abuse - that's what motivated him.
I think you're hurt, but Mrs. Scurrider called again to ask how the printers were doing.
You think clenex is my co-sponsor.
I remembered this thought, what they put on the howl.
What did she do?
how the us-china trade war would be good for beijing
Beijing has a long-term plan to open the Salvos trade war between China and the US, and as the arena is removed, other countries will benefit, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning of a tax on solar panels, steel and aluminum, a key Chinese export this year.
The new currency is the $200 billion ($150 billion) worth of goods this week, which are affected, with exactly half of the tax rate coming from the US to China.
Beijing has always been a business, with a recent increase in tariffs from five to ten cents on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has pledged to join the US and the world's second-biggest economy will soon change.
To make Washington more interested, but publicly embarrassing to the US, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say that if the U.S. military trade pressure can play its part properly, the long-term plan to help China should reduce the economic ties between the two countries.
The fact that quick political decisions are taken from Washington or Beijing is a very bad thing when the economy of their country is in recession, according to Abigail Grace, the research association's focus on Asia, I think is on the security of Central America.
Syria prepares to return refugees, foreign minister says
As the Syrians say, we are now ready to help humanitarians come to the refugees and help rebuild the country that has been lost in more than seven years of war.
He was speaking to the UN Secretary General, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ullam, about the country's unity as much as possible.
"Today's situation is very stable and peaceful, thank you for your cooperation in the fight against terrorism".
The government is restoring the terror-torn areas to normal living conditions.
Everything is now ready for a country that is on the verge of a recession due to terrorism and a single-sided, day-to-day economic boom.
It is estimated that more than 5.5 million people have fled from Syria since the war began in 2011.
another six million people in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
al-moallem says syria will accept aid to build its own country.
But he said he was too busy to accept the training or sponsorship from other countries.
