A Republican strategy to hinder Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican attorneys have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Unlike what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States.
And in line with that, most American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made it harder for people to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 41 states in 2011.
The new election laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the vote and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities therefore rushed to extend the practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required ID card costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are thus disproportionately affecting young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more to it.
In many states students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
Moreover, those same States authorise members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the vote in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have led to a decline in the registration rate of new electors in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state's voters.
The same thing happened with the Hispanics.
These represent no more than 11% of the electorate, which equates to 24% of citizens voting in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been fiercely opposed to the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage was partly limited.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed legislation requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, there is no denying that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say for sure whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this respect, the measures will undermine partly the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: Do you have to take the test or not?
The PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant of their own, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
Do you want to take the test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States have found a high rate of infections among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
The European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, followed up at 12 years, also showed that there is a 30 to 40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from age 50, or from age 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer, and to offer them all the possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not address long-term life, in which case they should opt for active disease surveillance.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer go untreated because the cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly setting precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend you take the test anyway.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor about whether you should get tested or not.
Movember has, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved around enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10 percent of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, fighting smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85 percent of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other cancers.
It's a huge health hazard for people.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
Obesity and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer", they add.
Food
The Commission also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Sugar products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to cancer", they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being, their investigations are inconclusive.
According to the CCS, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them showed a decrease in prostate cancer risk, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
Mr Beaulieu also stresses the importance of discussing the concerns and family history of each person with his doctor.
"Doing the screening doesn't cause cancer".
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a great stir last summer, and rightly so.
In fact, this boson is believed to be part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what's more, it's about the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But physicists aren't entirely sure that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, let's assume it's Higgs, since the chances of getting it wrong seem slim.
There is, in this great world, a general and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that it also has a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly, of some of their characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other side are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories' website The Particle Adventure, which is, by the way, extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I might point out here, are not the exotic creatures we might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon, or "light particle", that acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment - much like throwing a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, except that it's another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to activate it, you have to reach extremely high energies, kind of like a frozen pond where only a thick rock can slide through the surface.
This is why a huge particle accelerator like CERN's (the big hadron collider is a 27 km ring!) is needed to reach such energy levels.
An analogy to the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a refrigerator door by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way) don't.
What can all these investigations "contribute" to?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
Many, on the other hand, are eager to meet, for the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that will fill certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, such as that it does not propose any explanation for gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (other ups!).
But we haven't found such differences at CERN yet.
The impact
The impact of such research on our daily lives is difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong to say that it will not have any.
So you see, in the early '60s, the pioneers of laser in the laboratories had no idea what revolution their work would bring.
They were interviewing the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, said, the laser was initially considered a "laboratory device".
Just imagine that.
And applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light sensor in 1969 during his research on optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this camera now serves as an eye for all digital devices in the world, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
The best way to die is Le Devoir.
In its Commission Die in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume soon as a draft law is prepared.
But within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to get a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him two years of respite.
"I had been given five years to live, but I'm already seven", he says, making a pass, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this", he continues.
The disease has left him devastated: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resigned himself to help him eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention, bring him medicine, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to have my diarrhea cured, it's humiliating", she admits.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man peees on his feet", relates Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Going back to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression", he notes.
Because, according to most people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Centre are cancer patients.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
Mrs. A., 89,'s greatest fear is dying "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have good children", he adds.
"I have no more desires in this life", she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the coming days, a final visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and nutrition assistance are provided.
They're palliative care that's given to them when there's nothing else you can do.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we all know we're gonna die someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctoral students at the center.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetics no longer control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones", says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois centre, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man enjoying his last family gathering in the yard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 who have cancer", says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a care facility.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Home Palliative Care Society of Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent paediatricians such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently", she relates, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pain without the necessary relief.
I fear that patients will want to die just because they are not getting the right care".
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when she left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she said that she felt very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting", she relates.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not meeting their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which is used to sleep the patient until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the untreated disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing, "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", but "I want relief".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP businessmen, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell us, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system" that includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
An industry that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system sprays once we've hunted the big media", says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal Police Chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into the misuse of road contracts in Quebec, which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only agreed to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, underground party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", it adds, hoping to "proving the existing schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government interventionists, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the "Marteau squad" police, who, since 2009, have made the Montreal "sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to serial recording of fraud and corruption charges against municipal officials like Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He is suspected of pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal road network engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to right and wrong during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberal parties in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted receiving money for inflating bills between 30% and 40% as fake extras.
In addition, a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she has since 2010 opposed the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in full boom real estate.
70% of the campaign money was dirty money.
Of the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says she pulls "a thread to understand how the system, infiltrated by ants, works to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We're cleaning up the wounds, but we'd need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that questionable practices don't happen again.
How to clean.
- Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected politicians in the current scheme".
Estimating the proportion of dirty money spent on election campaign financing in Quebec at 70%, he is ironic: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but that won't change the donation, he said, "as long as election spending isn't strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
It calls for a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "we cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that breakthrough?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
I'm advancing day by day by his side.
The technical staff has also been a great help.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes so fast in football.
But I'm not getting hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine training centre to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always made huge strides.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of information about my position.
It's backed by supporters like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the equipment?
- Of course you do.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles to Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first half of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we've qualified for the final eight with style.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We're gonna try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say to many very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our league against Porto to get the round of eight.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there long term.
Today, that's not the case.
The Commission considers that the measures provided for in this Decision are in line with the objectives of the common agricultural policy.
Not winning the Cup in Ligue 1, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we're going to put all our efforts into winning that title.
Last season we didn't get far.
We were disappointed in May, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're down to 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It's normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We've accepted it completely.
After we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, they still face things that reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We'll never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to get a game project started.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League, we've shown we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, failed to qualify for the final eight, and they have invested a lot too!
Given the sums invested, we'd imagine you'd be 15 points ahead of the rest of the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been "pushed" by this new PSG.
That proves that League One is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up with the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We'd better say we have a Zlatandependence.
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and he scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League One.
And he's proven in every team he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
That pushes the others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How have you been at Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and I came out reinforced.
I managed to play good matches in the national team today.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned a lesson from what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have exemplary behaviour today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first month in charge of the Blues?
It's getting results.
They're well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
Like the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the 16 October draw in Spain lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never seen a game like this in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
This is in contrast to current currency exchanges, which are based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a convertible virtual currency into dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows file exchange from one to the other.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded from 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin's price, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, before returning to the $10 mark today (the prices are counted on bitcoincharts.com).
It's not impressive at all when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, he described bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously accounting bookkeepers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin exchanges are recorded in the public ledger, which is circulated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction into that book.
This one goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown at computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a file-slicing phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter, unique numerical footprint.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "tossing" the whole.
The objective is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, most likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by up to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed with each increase in computing power.
The life of the net has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoin deposits have been stolen.
"The default used does not affect the same protocol", says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Heavy-duty actors like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, like the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are out of circulation.
In November, the "giant shovels" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to run in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They are only required to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but in 2013 there could be a change", he predicts.
Moreover, the ECB envisages in its report reassessing the various risks, now considered high, should this currency be successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should leave by the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take back their territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan peasants, who we consider terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of foreign military, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if their cause is joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajikists.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul unharmed, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the darkness of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking government land to sell as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting deals.
They're discredited; most of them haven't fought.
People, I've heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
The young are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived in the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, public schools are full of both girls and boys.
We must give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid of mobile phones.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in view of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has restored its services, no reservoirs have been repaired or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private sector.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take over.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the land and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig the immense boudical site and remain there as the province's most important employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore their normal relations.
French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' colleges, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a "civil and military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These jobs, which are a delight to get local labor, have helped contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cropland.
What will we leave behind as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often located at over 2,000 metres.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection of foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, they would need to maintain a small, well-controlled civilian aid that comes directly to them.
A Constitution with Force in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever as far as the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two months to finish its work.
And for almost two years now, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial turmoil.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delusion" and continues to "betray his word" and "trample on the right".
The Commission's supporters say it is a step to speed up the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short time period that forces the Brothers to abandon their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy is wreaking havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote my text or I maintain full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday on the text.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As was expected, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators are also pleased that one of the few discrepancies in the day was expressed at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on late yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all scrutiny, remains ultimately identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "norms", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it merely a publicity ploy.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could arise in the future would be to what extent are civil judges competent to rule on all this".
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms regarding the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those under the previous regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
As the military wishes, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
The prosecution of civilians in military courts will also not be prohibited, as advocated by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy continues and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
She said the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to be on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The head of state's supporters demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the belly of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
AIF identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptism pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and the overflowing nets.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
The faithful walk here on the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin for "Sorrowful Way").
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, going to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian World Emblem, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the site where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE.
As is traditional, people of different religions leave notes with their wishes, which will then come true.
Making a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge from the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in the year 25 BC for his family.
They are found on mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
The rest of you can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There are bus services from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly inhabited on the top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all on one trip.
But it's worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting ones.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the Judean desert caves, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It's worth a visit to the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
In his painting exhibition he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which is a few rooms of old Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers from that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are strictly prohibited.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they're calling the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
Israel's three main tourist areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of these has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarium and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 meters below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily holds even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to take courses of salt water, brine and curative mud and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to get their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street with your "same" symbol, luck will be in your favor.
In Jaffa you can find newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "taking" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to be carried in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily converted to shekel (currently 1-3$,8 shekel).
Urban transportation is mainly made up of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
It's actually from an underground funicular.
Traveling by any type of public transport costs 6 shekel and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops are closed and public transportation is suspended.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels only serve kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of beef and lamb dishes, coconut milk-prepared soups and desserts, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are grilled chicken balls, fruits and vegetables.
You don't see stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the contrary, many well-fed cats "walk about" in a spectacular way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Rumors are a favorite of crowded places and they don't turn down candy.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
Besides the insurance, which goes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will cost you 15 shekel a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekel.
Israel by figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, a figure that is 51% higher than the same figure in 2010, before the visa regime was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the compulsory examination law, there have already been counterfeiters trading "false" certificates in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
From 1 December a law comes into force, according to which every migrant worker must take an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as the Federal Immigration Service promises, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
It is also not enough to pass the examination of the language, if not also of Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even for the purpose of receiving and renewing the work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The law shall not apply to persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Usefulness, fatality and rights defence
The network of examination centres will be operated under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can take the test in all cities, and there are now more than 160 such centres in Russia.
The initiative on introducing the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights activists, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the Immigration Service replies, this will reduce the number of people suffering "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must begin before you leave.
Only an organised selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are those immigrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language or pass medical examination.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be doomed to encounter unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping, put him on a "paid trip" to a creepy, narrow cottage, where he and dozens of others like him spend months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We've received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise something, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the salaries promised", confirms the Head of the Directorate of Labour Immigration of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, little chief!
However, in the meantime many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tayik can afford a normal primary education.
This is because their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone dress them, dress them and buy them school supplies.
When they reach their teens, these boys venture to work at first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
However, when it comes to language law, rights advocates point out an important point.
Exams will only be taken for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and, consequently, no official job.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Forbidden to Strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry fake documents, we're not registered and extortion cases appear.
"We are being asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea", Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be a coward, buy a painting"
On the first day the language law came into force, it was clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several "false" certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by Federal Immigration officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they did not come to the hands of the new owners as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise migrant workers who have failed the first time the exam more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of registered gun crimes is quite low.
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons of civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Shotgunning during wedding celebrations where there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the gun law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the Internet, the authors of which, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be abandoned.
The percentage of vandalism with registered gun use is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told the BBC news service in Russia.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, during six months of 2012 142 crimes with firearms were committed in internal organs, compared to a total of 1168 crimes recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to target the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of illegal weapons proliferation is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Chief of Staff.
Screenshot of the website accepting arms orders
The first, "army or military vestry", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves", says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon", those stolen by criminals and security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police stores and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were deliberately set to cover the fault", says a former soldier.
According to Baranets, the gunmakers also put their sand granite.
"Private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market have now proliferated and are distributing under-wire weapons to the black market, including Moscow", says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"They have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons", explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market guns have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to guns", the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where armed conflict is taking place, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The gunman at one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have long since been bought by anyone because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a shipment.
The supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun, through a dealer.
They take it off the register and pass it over the fence.
"He takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers", he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the matters, so periodically, when the crime detection plan has to be met, they make proof purchases from illegal gun dealers", adds the official.
"Like a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the Begovaya platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a 'square' where we could negotiate.
The price of the gun, I only heard there".
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"I need a friend who has contacts to get a gun", says the store manager. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much".
There are vendors in the markets, but you have to get there too, say "from Mr Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that a tooth had fallen off your daughter".
I can even get a pair of steel handcuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I won't tell him.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets was put to the test as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when he was about to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They handed him a photo album where there was no "everything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique", recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a cat for a hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires right, we start negotiating", the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups on "Vkontakte", where it offers to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", they write in the headline of the advert "Buy a gun or machine gun".
Users place orders and ask questions.
And they sell minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy a gun TT. Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and is catching hands on those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia
Military commentator and former military leader Viktor Baranets
I've heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People are ordering.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions to find out where the weapon is hidden", reports the press secretary of the NGO "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you order online, you get gunless and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and is catching hands on those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia", he says.
Makarov for 100 bucks
According to experts, buying illegal firearms can cost you $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300 dollars.
It'll take a month and a half.
It's sent from the military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which is 22,900, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food restaurant and supermarket employees are on strike in the US.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has erupted in the United States at Walmart supermarkets and popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For now, no one dares say whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and recover in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest salaries received by Walmart workers and those in the fast food system, the protest organizers' goal is to create workers' unions in these companies.
So far, this sector of the economy has been virtually unoccupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", when the U.S. was in the midst of a discount orgy that captured millions of people, sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs and formed protest picket lines alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's stores, whose products target people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in their stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
Availability and product range have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to the two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as lack of lifting equipment or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" the protesters demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
That's about 1.1 percent more than you spend on salaries now.
If Walmart puts the pay rise on consumers' shoulders, every visit to the store will only cost them 46 cents more.
In a year they'll spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and caused no loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" went on in their stores from 8pm on Thursday until midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their registers made almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than "another public relations ploy", organized by the labor union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not just Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city are not appreciated, and so there is none at the moment), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York are getting $8.90 an hour.
No one makes less than them in this town.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that kind of money, to me, is incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers would stop by McDonald's and work there, behind the counter, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble across some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, a commentary in the Wall Street Journal commented that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing such a right and punishing union activists with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive turnover of staff.
Disagreeing
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work".
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the city's mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said "we must support workers in the fast food sector so they can get the fair wages and economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves".
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest such manifestation in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people took part, not all of them even employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to trigger a mass movement.
"For now, fooling the brain isn't that easy".
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among modern technology enthusiasts, is seen normally in recent times mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At its annual conference in early summer, Google demonstrated a moving model and later in November it was revealed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it was clear that for the company's scientists, the glasses were already a past stage.
They are attracted to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We're dedicated to person-computer interaction, but we're also trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been caught in the work stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Even though Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information input has improved (the system receives more data), and output is still not very good.
We're trying to change this, we're working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
We must free the world of computing from our own, the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, it is pending to resolve the privacy issue, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
Furthermore, gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a wristband that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
It's very large for now, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- What's that like?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You'll speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we're going to have to work primarily on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine a person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, since they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Are you lacking resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But the question is not about megapixels, but about the quality of the array and the depth.
From this last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact to make frames per second more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the camera's location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not introduced its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to a smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that's their strength (only you can see private things), but also their weakness: a glasses-based augmented reality won't allow you to work on virtual objects alongside other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands can't feel a thing!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth well could be the addition of touch sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is using the second hand as a support for the image.
He records the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really geared toward bringing tangibleness to these "air images", for example, interference from several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling to what you would feel if someone were blowing you in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here's another challenge we're going to have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space think they're going to an open space, almost endless.
Right now, fooling the brain isn't that easy, it's still a lot of work to do for years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg vanguardism", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront of art and culture.
This list of the best includes brilliant figures of St. Petersburg art and the scene, whose achievements extend beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even being known by Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and opening ceremonies.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they're exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late '80s - early '90s.
He is also an urban man whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens the inhabitants to smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took up an organillo and became the organ maker of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult paper, for his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
Kirill, why are you going around town in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red because I'm a fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that isn't a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of unhealthy properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I made friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones exhibiting in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I got into the theater for clothes, music of all kinds, but not for lyrics.
And all this was put together at your art clinic... it was important to me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical arts club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemians of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought "Van Gogh's Ear" to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was a host of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; he received his basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular customers used to go there.
I'm a hero from the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was done in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our time it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the present and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being that way is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything gets bad and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothes.
Now they follow you by clothes, orienting themselves to the outside, but not to the inside.
And maybe you don't even shake hands with that person, you just spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We saw you as the town organist recently.
Who better to be me!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people got into herds, bohemians wanted one thing, the simpsons the other.
Now that everyone's split into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everybody.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event, 300 people go, 10,000 never come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to ruin what you've accomplished.
When I was young, I made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused to pay money just to paint pictures.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a concept: cultural official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones, everything was different, kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level who can properly evaluate them and pave the way for them.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital.
But on our rocks it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we have more writers than readers now, this is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is small.
We have to make art as fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a hit with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board set off in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How can the species continue in unprepared conditions or on the same planet as the spare?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars", says the chief researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Problems of reproduction in space began to be addressed with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit differed in no way from the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, little fruit flies, the drosophils.
In 1979, cod eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops under unprepared conditions.
We get a normal chicken as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, must stand on its own feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Without support, the chicks randomly flipped.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
And the unfortunate thing was that after four days they just died.
"And we got the chicks born twice, but then we left because it was impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, only one sex species will travel on Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is the female organism.
Our seagull is flying, and no one on Earth could tell if it's after a space flight.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question", comments veteran aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after the space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice went into orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, counting the astronauts who after long flights have done well, and a healthy generation is growing up.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", sums up cosmonaut pilot, Soviet Union hero, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
But humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in creating artificial gravity.
The HydroLab at the Cosmonaut Training Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Under zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, though still hostile, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it'll be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of first bathing, there are only 2 weeks.
"This is too little to forget", says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, then for women gravity is necessary, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrease very quickly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we skip that, relying on the action of birth control stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this will push you.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the organism cannot produce the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special training suit, like adults.
It will simply deprive him of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we will do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in bringing a disabled person, a totally unfit person, to Earth", predicts Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, in time this will become a reality, when humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
NKÚ chief: Inspection of the "švarc" system has not found the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is lax.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKÚ) said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This, in my opinion, is what we lack", he describes the current situation.
The joint checks by the Czech and German inspectors also reached similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the operation of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor to demand obligations", Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Committee on Auditors in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public procurement is to be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have brought it all together and although the controls have not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to introduce increasingly strict rules, but that the focus must be on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop investing in making laws, reducing and improving limits, even if this has no such positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting the right thing at a reasonable price (which doesn't always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But reducing the limit of bids does not mean that we will get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much paperwork, those who want to look for flaws in the system can do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized in a different way?
The Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) is a similar organization to the NKÚ, with a school as well.
The competence of the courts is also somewhat analogous, but since Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (FRC) can only control federal money, which we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not normally like to make a comparison without concrete data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to specify exactly which is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
I'm sure I don't, but I repeat, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries which we take as models must face a large number of problems.
If not, it would be of no use to you to cooperate with our office, don't you think?
As regards the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the public procurement law mean for your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we have ex post checks, there must be some delay.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the protection of workers' rights, which is the subject of a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the protection of workers' rights.
Does the adoption of this law, in your view, be beneficial or, rather, a disruption to the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations "get harsher" and it is impossible to comply with them.
Under the previous legislation, controlled persons were already linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and any non-compliance with public procurement law was a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law this way?
I don't think it's like this.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this kind will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system, referring to the fact that they are autonomous only on paper.
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then even the prime minister of the government cannot prevent the Office from acting which is obliged to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and we allow it", but you can't say we'll pretend nothing.
In the public procurement law, the rules are quite strict as to how formal action should be taken.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
Roads have ice sheets, although mostly navigable
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are covered with ice and snow.
Although most roads are navigable, some must be taken with extreme caution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were navigable, but they were ice and snow plates.
The temperature will drop and oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lowlands the snow is thin.
On the other hand, on the crests of the Metallic Mountains, snow reaches nearly 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region's road operations control center.
The R6 motorway and the first-class road in the region are now unrestricted.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches of ice and snow.
The road must be more alert, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are in danger of freezing and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have formed on the roads, reports the Directorate of Roads and Highways.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads from the mountains of Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemian region, the sky will be clear and partially cloudy today, with no rainfall.
Temperatures will usually range from three below zero to a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are navigable this morning, although extreme caution and weather adjustment will be required.
In the early morning hours, there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and subsequent decline in temperatures, some roads could also be covered in ice.
In some places, drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is revealed from the information from the regional road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the route between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the Pilsen-Tachov road area bordering Germany there may be sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category roads are wet, so in this case, sections with ice plates are also warned.
Drivers should be more careful, especially on the less busy roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher elevations of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, snow was still left in the port of Červenohorské and on the road to Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed the snow overnight; about three centimetres of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, remains of snow remain.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will encounter half-disposed snow heading towards Jeseník", an operator from Šumper's road administration confirmed to ČTK today.
On the ground and at night, Jesenická and her colleagues visited and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are unrestricted, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution in the forest areas, where the roads remain wet.
The region of Ústí nad Labem and the region of Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different sections in the early morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road, but in the lowest areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
There were no service complications.
Road operators have warned of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal at night, with rain and snow expected to melt during the day and clear skies and ice at night.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the main roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of trees that had been arched over the road by the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: We want to build positive energy in our concerts
They say the world is coming to an end in just under a month. What do you think?
It's just one of many other alarming news stories we like to grab.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
And in December, you're hosting a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state charity event we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the end of the Mayan calendar has for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December at 9 p.m., we will organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
It was my idea at first, then we went to forge the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
To celebrate the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the world, canceled".
It's currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at charity concerts?
Of course it will, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All the performers will sing it at the same time at all three concerts.
The hymns will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the live special broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We also work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, besides organising many charity events and concerts...
We are committed to participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised from the end-of-the-world concerts be used for?
To equip the Studeo Barrierless Education Centre, which we have completed for the sixth consecutive year with the civil partnership Tap in Jedličkův Ustáv.
Students at Jedličkův Ustav school regularly receive visiting teachers with whom they have fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have the financial means to pay teachers and we are making an effort to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to create a program that is appealing to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests.
Next year we'd like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of the fact that we're in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, you have so far acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the instrument boxes...
However, we have managed to do well so far, and ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which still surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With the help of excursions abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards disabled people and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that in the east there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still uncommon for a person to move alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, for example, isn't there.
Fortunately, a civil society has been set up to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways should we follow the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects we're behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with severe disabilities to move around on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap let's go a little further!
A society that respects and respects is one thing, but when the time comes for prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, everything will start to change.
So far, they're isolated cases of people with a lot of willpower.
The Tap Tap is very popular today, but if you look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I went to Jedličkův Ustav as an educator, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a coworker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we got a little out of hand. (Laughter)
However, popularity didn't really catch on until the last few years, am I wrong?
It is true that connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group helped us a lot.
We came to the conclusion that the work that you don't see, is as if it doesn't exist.
Thanks to the European Union's aid, we can also afford quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something could be done differently.
The show world is full of things that look alike.
It is logical, in his way, that everything new is taken with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone seeing us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned, suffering beings for whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop themselves, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works out for people with disabilities, then it's not just a breakthrough for them, but for the whole society.
Did the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come in with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and when they find out they have to go to rehearsal for two days, go to the prep exam and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already in early 1998?
Only one, the one named Lada Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has the will and the will will will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will be attended by 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the group's song The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled"
The concert aims to raise the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment at the STUDEO Barrierless Education Centre in Jedličkův Ustav in Prague, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
Entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free admission in the early sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of European Space Agency ministers last week, Poland was accepted as the 12th ESA member.It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and for the following years took part in the Agency's project commission.
However, Poland's journey into the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld's lecture at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw, where on 6 December 1933 he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great proponent of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the moon's hidden face was named after him.
Already in 1925 a dredge was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who the author of the proposal was and the outbursts of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used to start the dredge or to brake it.
Information about this dressing is limited to the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is clear that the investigation has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - powietrzna torpeda i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine first referred to the society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronomy.
In one of them, by Professor M. Subotowicze, it was proposed to create a society devoted to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was obvious that cosmic research was a future-oriented discipline.
From early 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial tests of two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of actual scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a maximum range of 14.5 km and its mission was to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aero Institute, whose first aerial tests were started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of space on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
This means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) creates economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and in this way 'provokes a drop' in the price of the competitor in order to take over the majority of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour is higher than in other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment this phenomenon generates, the state's social expenditure necessarily grows.
This situation is conducive to the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage caused by their desire to make profits.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies where the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially as regards wages.
This is achieved, on the one hand, by the system of economic obligation in the case of longterm unemployment; on the other, by the restricted right of employees to work.
The result is growing poverty along with the growing gap between rich and poor.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves by their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of assistance is already at one million.
In the context of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly common case occurs: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A similar scandal was made public in relation to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The savings measures of almost all southern EU states are undoubtedly leading to the same situation: people, pressured by a sharp decline in their social levels, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live with a terrible wage at the edge of society, in the hope that private capital will one day arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another or never arrives, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny fraction of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media state to the satisfaction that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital is defending with its fingernails and tooth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering with control.
The question then arises whether private capital does not influence the political process and, therefore, the whole state with its selfishness.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in every state.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favour, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: the state ministries, in the absence of financial means, entrust the drafting of bills to private legal entities, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are passed later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus all power does not come from the people, as is stated in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation similar to that described by Appianos in his book The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state was taking time to disintegrate and administrations were occupied by force".
In exchange for bribes, unlawfully obtained favors and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and people went to the polls with the vote blown in advance"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be seriously talked about that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianus thought of Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in the past, is that today's society is based on unconscious preferences for individual benefit without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, able to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without any effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be found in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy as a definite pause in the waiting for the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and recent history.
The suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the lab of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there have been mixed reactions.
One side of Israel is arguing for the right to self-defense and labeling Palestinians as terrorists, the other supports Palestinians and alleges racism by the state of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and labels Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the repeated killings and who is the victim. After all, the citizens of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born in the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look to discover who is taking advantage of the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached based on my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In every age we can find a great Alexander or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always the ones who guided their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who guided their actions toward a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era where the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this entails has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still anyone behind, I don't know, but I don't rule it out): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much near them.
Of course you do.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts, and power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have significant holdings in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but Russia has in the meantime subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild's central bank status, began printing money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second was to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Britain; and the third was to reduce the earth's population from half a million to a billion people (such a number of slaves would suffice for their welfare and luxury and would not consume as many resources), as well as the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a foreground for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the wealthiest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates, follows the dynamics of triggering crises and subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, which are in fact not yet in force, but which are in fact being discussed in the Committee on Budgets.
So after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the First World War broke out as a result, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended abruptly and unjustifiably from a military and economic standpoint, with the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a conflict situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they were only able to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong enough and simple enough to point out the culprits, and then build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that was to represent and represent so well the role of the fifth column, which lit the flames and caused the outbreak of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the rope that the international bankers had tied him to in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers were to start it, the Jewish nation, like in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of battle, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, which are in line with the objectives of the European Union.
Where does injustice engender injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current Israeli President B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all the world's oil passes (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
What a light is now being set upon the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order".
The new world order in your imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world where every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
"He makes everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, have a mark on their right hand or forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell unless they bear the name of the beast or the number of his name.
You need to understand: whoever has two front fingers, sum the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six".
If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive prospects: throwing the Shah overboard was not allowed, as if he did, he would jeopardize the confidence of his allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later intensified with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the US, their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck is themed on an episode of this story, which garnered a small hit for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, which was helped by a bizarre cover story: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew that was examining the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of sexes
The plan outlined by exfiltration expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a singular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example might be the series Ocean's Eleven).
The film combines moods, and on one side we find well-documented footage of Tehran, and the credits show iconic photographs of the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film, and there's not much difference in that.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the office hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respected director and his acting style has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Little Goodbye, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which the action doesn't take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is "winding" in Canada.
The film's best scenes take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of true events, and the opening sequence of the embassy shoot is impressive for its synoptic ability, which at the same time conveys the emotion of the confusion and the unpredictability that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the impostor team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he does quite well. Sometimes he adds something to the reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene of the crisis at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the rampant search for his trail become crazy).
Argo's weakness is the uncontrollability that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses some dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be continued with moderate interest, appreciation of its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that's going to be hard.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, that is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually submits a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the EU's most absurd regulations or ideas".
"We thought after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in management positions in large European companies", said Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organizer.
Among the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women had a better price on life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year".
The election will take place at the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel that, as a result, harm the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the shadowy guideline about the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The actual prohibition on the use of the term 'unite cap' or the removal of the classic bulb from shops has been criticized.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The EU apparatus often takes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
One lobbyist's interests were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should be at least 14 centimetres long in the EU and not be able to show 'abnormal curvatures'.
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it was only trying to harmonize the national standards which had not been homogenized to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules on fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been relaxed on the basis that the existing directive entails food waste.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year's US prescription that inflatable balloons that are marketed must be warned that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The US was referring here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of childhood death by suffocation.
A similar restriction is in place for the use of wood pellets by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East, which is a very important issue for the European Union.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's requirement on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which threatened to impose a substantial fine.
The survey organisers were also interested in the possibility of paying countries without access to the sea and in the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
This kind of idea did not come about in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we do not have a sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation", said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), in autumn 2004.
He argued that our country produced a lot of cereals and that, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
Palas said that since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
The grant for a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development under Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member State guidelines are often the target of criticism, and the EU's regulatory efforts and, more effectively, the functioning and development of the Union as a whole, are deserving of our recognition, according to several experts.
The most serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects which have nothing to do with deepening European integration but which the Member States have achieved in budgetary negotiations.
The Czech Republic is also concerned, as are other countries in the Union, with the struggle for the right to designate the origin of its traditional products, although our country has not always won these battles.
After six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the origin name of the Olomouc Requeson, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate may be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
The official list of EU protected designations of origin, together with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the German city of Lübeck's mazapan and the Parma ham, already includes the Karlovy Vary biscuits, the Pohořelice and Třeboň carp and even the Žatec hop variety.
As EU protected seas, they can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší barquilles.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was fine in our country, then I wouldn't run for office.
But I can't stand to see the last 20 years of robbery in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes go up and retirement age goes up.
I had no ambitions of being a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm running for office independently, the only chance I have of changing things is to run for senator or president.
He's already in the Senate, but shortly afterwards he's on his way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for you?
I always said my candidacy for president depended on the results in the Senate election.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the TV, but we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
To this are added the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I'm said to have bribed journalists or been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
He's coming to the presidential fight with financial theses and criminal responsibilities from politicians and declaring property over twenty million.
To do that, you must change the law.
As president, you have no such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I've been part of a lobbying group for the job of a guide to be recognized as self-employed, and we've got it.
The problem is politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether it is from the right or from the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without any biases or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose from each party what is best for our country and apply it.
Is he more of a right-wing man or a left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more of a leftist.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we get ahead.
I don't care if someone's right-wing or left-wing, I want people to unite.
I am always openly supportive of any good solution, whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the SDGs, and I will also be against bad ideas.
He's kidding when people say you're a populist.
But you're not proving it with what you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
But without parliamentary support, all you have left are slogans.
And with that, he can't survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I don't have a choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to get them on my side to do it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they'd have to communicate why they don't want to.
If there's a strong character pointing out the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the President as an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I'm just getting started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I'm trying to get things going myself, but in case it doesn't work out, in six years I'll leave and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I don't do anything with a person, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
I, for one, have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the light heating oil fraud.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not attend the polls and those who did did did voted for the establishment representatives.
In the Senate, we're two independent.
The people elected the senate, so it's going to be difficult to bring about change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the impeccable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You talk about property statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a floor valued at 10 million, another floor valued at 8 million, a collection of artworks worth 10 million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream, and I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was generous with women, and at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not much interest in my program.
And I'm not under any obligation to pay for the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I'm going to get as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live off it. For example, I couldn't afford my son to go to an English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run for office.
So you're going to keep your business going so you can live?
Didn't you say earlier that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I've partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in the spring.
People would want the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I need to live off something, too.
How much do you usually earn as an entrepreneur each month?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I was president, then I'd quit the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company near the library, points out, "Besides, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder what we need a library for these days.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom town located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute in some way to the general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how policymakers decided that there was only one way to improve statistics: we had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master of the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun as well as cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and attended the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in perplexity and shrugged its shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse book mountain, the so-called `Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is raised in its intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and town hall buildings.
In early November the book mountain was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the 'Dutch National Wood Award 2012'.
Thus, the little town without history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy centre, now boasts a contemporary architectural work.
But most of all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it's a book paradise under a cheese.
True, there is an elevator that transports us right into the center of this mountain range, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to see, the brick floor and the elegant lanterns unmistakably support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
If you look up, you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally bookshelves are arranged along the facade and in the center a huge dark room opens up that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
What we've done is we've turned the classical spatial configuration upside down and pulled the reading zone from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well developed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room.
Special mention is given to black shelves that serve as wall coverings, parapets and railing at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in Spijkenisse.
And so it is that one day, on a farm in Frisia, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimeters thick has been used as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It's a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and then gets thrown away.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to four centimeters thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (APP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous, and resistant material that smells like a mixture of a new car and a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 meters around the mountain, we are rewarded: From the café you not only get a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere at par with the atmospheric humidity that is suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"While it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary ecological project", notes Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Even though the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines only for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located in a transverse direction to the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is about the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there, too.
Also, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library, calling the "Boekenberg" the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the opening ceremony that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
This is intended to fill in the gaps in a library that has not yet been fully archived and currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows your book is part of the library.
Even if it's only there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved great success in that discipline which in the specialist slang is known as "creating an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point for shaping your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained from voting on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather acute diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of a United Nations observer state.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
- Why? - I don't know.
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that binds the country to Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I think it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is now refocusing its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to decide what their role will be, but they have already begun the path to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What exactly does a 'normal' foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy which, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, that is, exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests differ to some extent from those of other great powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken on the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it that much importance since this isn't a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in the German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by refraining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position is very much understood.
I therefore do not believe that there has been such a drastic breakdown as in Libya.
Perhaps Germany has thus earned some respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the United States has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
There have always been these disparities because of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I think the real disparity of views is not really the scale that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but this is not the case.
They are therefore not able to be part of a higher entity, but must push things from their own standpoint.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
This is of course not easy for Germany, whether it is simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a hot topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to it, it is always uncomfortable and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany takes a leading role, certain anti-German sentiments are aroused.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this way Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the United States on European policy is declining, but the EU is not currently filling that gap.
The Germans will have no choice but to take a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them unpleasant or makes them an even more unpopular people, that's life!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This name hides a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it is protected as long as the true eponymous does not bring a claim.
And even then it's not clear they're going to be right.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China", notes Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Impersonators simply add a couple of letters to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as happened to the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a file cabinet where he keeps seats at the Beijing trademark office.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name also used by the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of various plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature.On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It's about women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities don't feel guilty
"It is harmful to business, we must fight it", Pattloch demands.
"The brand is flooded, the monopoly position is gone and the damage to the image is enormous".
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors affected are millions, especially for flagship luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, the cancellation of doubtful registration marks in the trade mark register is complicated and also a lot of money.
The processes can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases where the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name under the lawsuit had already become a 'market reality'.
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the process has damaged the plaintiff's brand in China", Pattloch notes.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a blue and white logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the case was settled in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
Lacoste lost in China to Hong Kong and Singaporean imitation clothing manufacturers whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities don't feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to a lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal".
The number of unprocessed complaints has thus been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is usually the case in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1,4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this is also the case with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in the form of duties.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family firm Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese impersonator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of counterfeit car parts,
The impersonator has secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected", says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also rejected the municipalities' appeal.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been given the right, but the opposing party is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where a decision is still pending.
Wentzler is confident that the matter will be resolved favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
"This shows how much we care", says Wentzler.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten to affect even Europe,
In particular, if copyrights are secured there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the Freudenberg name in Germany for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial area, but it has managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful", says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark law, but what must be done is "register in China also everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject may prove to be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his private battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of surpassing far beyond 8,733 kilometers away.
First, it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and mocasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the singers' voices (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to rise slowly, swirling, entangling and following one another.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his boxes by trying to put order with his energetic, gentle gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The 50 singers, aged 23 to 69, from the human geneticist to the housewife, have also arrived.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choral voice has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Self-help aid
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Program, there are about 34 million people worldwide infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents for the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estjeni.
Seventy of them go to high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story-teller" or "breadman" in Zulu.
In this room no one can speak fluently this Bantu language, but they do sing.
For the past ten years, this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language, which sometimes brings them back to their homeland of southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers [8,733 miles] in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them children.
More than 300 have no parents anymore because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what is affecting Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The general population does not view circumcision as a good practice, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of infection.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at the age of just over 30 has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this secluded population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only their parents' protection but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school diploma, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since taken care of AIDS orphans professionally in Estjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STIs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Licking and scabies are among the STIs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonias, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In our country, human papillomavirus is also one of the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't offer one hundred percent protection.
Some sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you change sex often.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for its performances throughout Germany, they come to raise quite a bit of money.
"We have already sent a total of about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and capable woman manages the money sent from Germany.
She makes sure that the orphans find a good place to stay, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live in, and ensure that children attend school on time each day and dress in their uniforms.
Those who have no one to feed are protected by Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coop and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is so evident throughout the country, it is not often openly discussed.
A King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is a taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Strange thing in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excess-filled lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life that is not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread of HIV that has been experienced in recent decades.
But it's also because of the countless temporary travelers who travel the country from one side to the other and take you wherever you go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "free condoms can be found anywhere, but they are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact".
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; such recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear some angry border soldier out of his tears.
The journey always takes them to Estjeni, where the singers visit the children.
Although this small population barely appears on maps, it is well known in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Come near Estjeni, there is light", the locals say.
And after walking the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, it also has icy water, as revealed by three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has formed a layer of ice.
It appears that this one is at least 30 centimeters long and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that collided with Mercury in the early days.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger's chief researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to shed light on how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
They send images to Earth from time to time: small windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of endless generations of stars: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, unromantically called W5 by scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This twisted image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made up of the material the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the massive Trifide Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars form from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are a single-eyed object visible in the night sky.
However, with the telescope, you can better appreciate colors.
The helix nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.
This budding star was captured in all its glory for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of astronomy's great unknowns.
These are probably remnants of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Milky Way.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Trifide Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot core of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiucus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in fusion are slamming into each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula, located 1,400 light-years away, is composed of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars also continuously emerge, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole, there's still no dust, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe hydrogen was the main source.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, the Large Binocular Telescope is being raised.
This allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canary on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous ability to pick up light.
Despite its comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capabilities.
View from the Southern European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will be 42 metres in length and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018, it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each of them 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea, a new telescope of enormous size and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters is planned.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he's been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission, 1,235 candidates for planets have been located.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury as well.
However, there is no credible evidence, since the Messenger probe orbits the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004), the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is.
Drinking butter every day and living 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of Bible study.
There's even a museum dedicated to longevity.

A fingerprint search in a country where people aged 97 are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus moves with great speed through the winding road that passes beside forested hills, flowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The Talyshi people live here, a people of which little is known, except that they perfectly master Persian and Azerbaijani and are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit quite into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth the country enjoys thanks to the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the world's oldest people", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis from the place who have exceeded 100 years of age.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of your sons died at the age of 136
However, the museum's undisputed star is sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify it.
And if we consider that the documented oldest man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"She was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, very old people also live", says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil registration.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum's director, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional standpoint, it does not seem logical that the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom also drink a glass of melted butter daily, be so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, he's relatively young for what he looks like at these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge can of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
Two little children also jump from side to side.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, a tea served in typical, pompously shaped glasses.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf she hides two long dark-blond hair strands that her son finds us proud.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it never fell off and it's kept its color.
"I have never used a shampoo", Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live on
He's always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping in a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything went back to normal when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird on the lips of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the worship of the nation's father figure, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness handed over to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's drug-filled son is right: "In our culture, the elderly are highly respected".
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care, and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the term "human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Riverside demonstrations in Cairo show the tremendous division the country is in.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president didn't spare in patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, especially the Coptic Christians, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims, and the seculars.
All of them, so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily cancel the Constitutional Court's powers and expand theirs "to save the revolution".
Yet neither the Egyptians nor the whole world knows very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
You're trying to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were forced to pass by a constituent assembly of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour nightly meeting, are truly concerning.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What does that mean, though, by "principles"?
This was and is still open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague wording, as well as the legal maneuver that has been added, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a newly added article suggests: on all matters relating to sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power in all Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be this way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacitating of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What's also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prisons.
As the draft states, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is so imprecise in legal terms that with the help of this article, the state institutions could even control the content of cinema and literature.
I think it is a matter of censorship.
It is true that no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his heirs.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
The wording that prohibits "offending people" is equally questionable.
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke about a lawyer?
It is a matter of interpretation, as are many other things in the draft which has been submitted to Morsi for signature and which, according to his words, will be submitted to the Egyptians "very soon" for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks now, the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of Islamist superiority.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in the Tahrir Square of Cario and swore to make the Act fail before it could come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning", says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the presidential lists.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be "in the garbage can of history".
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him", says opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for", opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim community, for their part, called for a counter-demonstration, if not on Tahrir Square, but after a prayer across the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafist supporters took part in it, shouting: "The people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Mursi "clean up the country", while proclaiming: "The Quran is our constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty in the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, Morsi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should go.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists' draft has a guaranteed majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him Human Rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution", he lamented in a conversation with the newspaper 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The expansion of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of democratic play and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it", Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster you cannot control".
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most stinking fish?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has anything to do with its greed for a highly odorless fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing scent of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the scenery is spectacular, and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how badly smelling you prefer it.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians crowd to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink", says Havard Halvarsen, the city firefighter who is also known as the "Rakfisk General", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink large amounts of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk", says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it's not bad; it's not much different from a serving of sushi that has travelled a few miles on a bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty plagued Norway and before refrigeration, fish were stored in water and salt in airtight barrels during the fall.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is well fermented, it is removed and, evidently with the senses inactivated by alcohol, eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly; over 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive social service system.
A stream of Swedes, the old rival and not so much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered an important part, though quite smelly, of Norway's past.
It's among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich costs you the fuck of 10 euros each.
Norway is not usually on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own could commit such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and who, with her long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people".
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to show off".
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn't have in the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy", says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk", he adds with a laughing curve.
I'm in the snow, queuing up to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A TV has been connected live to a host wearing a bird and surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard".
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapours of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad these days.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal".
Before kneeling down with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A highly populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism on the site and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city you can drive on one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked, muddy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see signs bearing his name at the entrance to a modern multi-sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change", says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy from Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"Especially in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change our country so desperately needs".
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejects the opposition's lack of essence of the new president.
"He's a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic statesman and, above all, he's a person who can listen".
But on the other side of the state, that's not the impression that many people have of his former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Neza City, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden beneath highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called upon to intervene to help fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly severe.
In a deserted plot, next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, he failed to address the issue of femicide while in office.
The most critical of the two accuse his administration of being a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorating neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears as she shows me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner killed her.
"When I arrived at his house, it looked as if his body had been cleaned", recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared".
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that's exactly what the family says he's been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like an old gossip girl, a troublemaker, a whistleblower.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and shut up".
"But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect", he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
"I hope that he is the same kind of president as he was when he was governor", says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that's exactly what the families of the victims of Neza City fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report mistreatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his time in prison.
The trial focuses on Manning's time at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dropped on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, charged with the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to denounce the mistreatment he now alleges he suffered while under military custody.
During the interrogation that prosecutors conducted on Manning in a preview of the trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defense's request that the case be dismissed as his imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already meant sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in custody.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at the Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and written down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment given to him by the cellists as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional".
The forms show no reports of ill-treatment, although officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those issues and had indicated to him that they would be addressed, but that they had not recorded those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having talked about the problems) but that doesn't necessarily mean I wouldn't have mentioned any problems", Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council tasked with examining the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the 'injury prevention' regime under which he was.
The military said it had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below that of possible suicide surveillance, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so that I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to just Camp Arafjon, that cage", Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage".
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, some slippers, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move around all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he slept.
He said if the lockers couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 regarding the treatment Manning received.
Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday's statement that, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of cell clerks and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he inferred from the order given to him by the jailer that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used his underwear or his ankles to self-harm but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed their underwear, their ankles and their glasses from their cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she experienced during her time in prison and drastically reduce her sentence in case she was convicted at the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to make Manning guilty of misdemeanor charges and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of enforcement for all detainees who are in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawful publication of information on the Internet, leaking of national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If he's found guilty on all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Posters pointed to two queues: one for "Mexican" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds not sure where I was supposed to go.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's ethnic typography, just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians".
I later decided on "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, typography or scripts were not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the level of a native speaker and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I was thinking about that moment this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, was immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is now so likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as if he ventured to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, though he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half their territory to gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So the moment a US official says anything that brings the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are going to war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the relationship they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot of it.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that somewhere in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or the mother or one of the grandparents, who was shut the door to opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person was a certain profile: dark skin, low education, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are their descendants and loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may not always be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
We also know that many of the Mexican elite in the ruling class don't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they look over our shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still, as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter are upset by it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they're not part of either.
We love to listen to the Mexican band The Northern Tigers, but we also love to listen to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexican.
Now, to make things even more complicated, from what I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as Mexico's improvised "ambassadors", representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would press political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with the wage inequality, the rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us aren't so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
It's just right.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
I'm not going to.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, many buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional upheaval.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their deadly stalemate could be derailed.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify today.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 remains in place, this week's fighting has reinforced the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite a good beatdown in Gaza.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas' leaders could conclude that time is playing their favor.
Since Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a rising regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah-military party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the region's balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn't have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas's cousin and its leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military question is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel's Iron Dome missile system has proven effective and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more peacefully... for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is steadfaster than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly because of the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite being illegal under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 elections, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets like their compatriots in Gaza?
Better have them behind that wall and give them a good shot if they lift their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, though the Arab spring could alter his calculations.
Although the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower in the area will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should think long term too.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dustbin that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics are worsening the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that which sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper, are advocating: two states and the ceding of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the people struggling for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the impending attempt to obtain a virtual state status at the UN.
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he omitted to present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, she seems just as reluctant to pay attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and body parts with diseases are lit on green-lit, off-the-shelf boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia's world-first tobacco and generic packaging law comes into force and replaces brand logos and colors with an olive green blackout wrapper, scary images of sick body parts and depictions of children and babies who are sick because they are children of smoking parents.
Apart from the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, which are mandatory from Saturday, are the brand names, all of them printed in a small font.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regimen in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
He relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand", said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market in tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for splinters and silicone lids to cover the nasty images of the boxes had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a lawsuit in Australia's Supreme Court.
Mrs. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stocks.
"It's a good deal for us".
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social media among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers not to show cigarettes, tobacco marketing has shifted to online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet for local businesses and websites, but it cannot restrict it to foreign sites.
"If you're marketing tobacco and you only have this little window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in brand reviews from "loyal citizens" posted on social media websites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco of Australia said the industry is more focused on what the new regulations involve than on marketing.
Industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though neither of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek claimed that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images in the box.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, stricter laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
"I'm not affected by photographs.
I just don't listen to them".
"You take the cigarette and you put the package away", says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit: for my daughter".
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, says that uniform trays make it more difficult to place them on shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unpack a delivery; now I'm four", Yu says.
"The government should have banned tobacco altogether and then, that's it, okay, it's over and we close the store", he says as he raises his hands up.
In a world that's constantly connected, it's not so bad to get bored a little bit.
During this year's Thanksgiving party, unexpectedly, I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, like books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academics and child development experts who praise the goodness of boredom.
They say that it is okay for us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are now connected to this or that screen, we don't experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom with goodwill?
- I know.
And no, you can't.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more leisure time, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the 2011 book "Boredom: A Lively History" published by Yale University Press, says, this is not true.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti on boredom dating from the 1st century AD.
We also need to consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways", says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wishing, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He says the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person doesn't do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly".
Boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, bored people tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while depressed people view the problem as their own.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what's really happening to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened to a full-volume TV program in the next room that kept no relation, others listened to it at low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group never listened to the audio at all.
The group that listened to the program at a low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they had trouble concentrating, but they were unsure of why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, distracted attention can lead to boredom", said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, distracting music can help you avoid getting bored".
"In fact, we now know that moving or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person physically more alert".
"Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain still", says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: a plane delay, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure this, some researchers developed a "boredom trend scale" in the 1980's.
The scale includes questions like "a lot of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything".
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and varied stimulation.
But in general, teenagers are a group that gets bored pretty easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by searching.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But what she did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest levels", largely because both children and teenagers are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to extremes, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as gambling or falling into substance use as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain tells you that you should be doing something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you watch television, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he may not have learned to entertain himself or to take doses", says Professor Fenske.
And "that capacity to dose is applicable to other situations", he notes.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but he learns to be more self-controlled in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our aim should be to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate to something worthwhile", he says.
He points out that what people really want is a way to disconnect and enjoy a downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated", he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops".
Colorado: No instruction book for the new marijuana use law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car and a short time later Orozco received a court subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences that each carry a $100 fine) in which he was informed of the trial date.
"They treat us like criminals", says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response to hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana offenses are being overturned here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in Colorado's most conservative districts have pledged to move forward with the marijuana possession cases they've opened and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to stop newly authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"All this is changing so fast that I don't know what's next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in Washington state are also turning the issue around.
And they are still seeking advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licences, all before the deadline, December 1, 2013, is reached.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent to serve as a model", he says.
Washington's law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, leaving a year for swimming between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to offer "appropriate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nothing will be harder to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Aurora's police chief Oates emailed his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop bringing legal action for minor marijuana offences against people over the age of 21 and that the police would stop filing charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce city regulations regulating marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a more rigorous vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offenses that were criminal at the time they occurred", said Mr Buck in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction police, the county's largest city, no longer serve adult court sentences for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that have emerged throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with district attorneys", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law.
"They've spent so much time bringing people to court that, in fact, they still can't accept it's legal", he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become nationally tested cases of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials are enjoying a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still considers the sale and cultivation of marijuana a federal crime.
Proponents of marijuana legalization are hoping the Justice Department will back down.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and marijuana dealers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"While drug agents are unlikely to knock down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana, as permitted under the new law", said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug policy adviser.
Several cities in Colorado don't expect federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, although it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose passed a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious federal problem", said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We're studying what the community voted for versus what the state voted for".
There are many questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed to the point of being thrown out of Oxford for being a Tory"
Don't attack college students for their views just now.
I can't remember a moment in my life where I haven't been dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been to what I thought was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a history degree, I had already packed my bags, which sparked the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard reported that I had quit because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink in unheated cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may wonder what that's all about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing middle school students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College JCR (graduate student group) claim that they are "often seriously isolated, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" for their political views.
They want to create a position on their college's equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and which presented the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a staff with the silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" for introducing higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19, an elected OUCA president, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment as well as to the well-being of members", he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September of 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its height.
The university had voted last year to deny former student Margaret Thatcher an honorary degree following cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist tremble in terror.
Already during the first days of the new college welcome week, when the new students meet and meet the faculty, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that the professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative college students, but they were willing to participate.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and government opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminary.
First I attended the translation of 18th-century French texts into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I didn't say a word.
Pitt, a little man with a face that looked like a cookie dough, knew how to expel bad bile.
"Do thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just fools?" he asked.
The other college kids laughed.
My eyes burned with tears I tried to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people", Pitt groaned.
I went back to my room as a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at the university, and then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who applied to OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's the way it goes.
They're involved with anyone who's suspected of being a Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour".
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated".
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, right?"
I felt the same way gays should have felt before the liberal law of the '60s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to hang out with people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become a Labour Party member and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was waiting for were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory faculty member was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History assigned to my college.
They hated him for not only being from the Conservative party, but also being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for his adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here", he said.
I began to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world", he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had a flawless attitude".
Her painful eyes began to cloudy.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would break if you left him".
Tired of all the trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who was also a supporter of the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another history professor had hinted, quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men".
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
Back then, my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was inside crawling in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You may call me a weak tear.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Conservative prime ministers but, to this day, is hiding behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the opening of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apoteosic that brings together more than 130 high-end costumes created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most pompous of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social upbringing: from the modest modest town of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't put their little cuffs off on your magnificent rug like some beautiful pop music celebrities do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their Gstaad chalet", explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, who is close to forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentine
Argentine model Valeria Mazza also forgets the stylist's charisma.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art", he concludes.
The Alcurnia Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous, sixty-meter-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the walkway to contemplate a dream "audience" that looks at Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the dressing room Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this public of mannequins, such names as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg stand out.
Naty Abascal and the dressmaker, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trouser, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors she uses, they're bright and they're "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescribing lady Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco may forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of being old enough to wear one of his nightgowns...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
He was wearing a red suit, with a flying skirt, "corsage" draped and hears a word of honor.
"It was a dream come true", says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dress of the dresser's party with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 ragas (as the fashion designer calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace, and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority in the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone in late 20th century haute couture, "the return of high society clients".
Clouded for years with the elite's "savoir-être", now Valentino is its best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur of the L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of her clients' husbands.
"I have always been struck by its refinement, its calmness, its clean, perfect appearance", admits D'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a close friend of mine.
"He was flawless, time never passes for him".
If a princess says so...
The toughest trade in the world: human mules from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers gamble with their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend daily to the bottom of its crater, where sulfuric gas emanating from the Earth's gut solidifies when it comes into contact with air.
After tearing up large rocks of sulfur, weighing in all about 70 kilograms, he carries them in two bamboo baskets carrying them over his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 metres to the summit of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres, but exhausted tortoise-carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend in a tortoise-like manner, keeping their balance and measuring their steps gently so as not to slip and fall down the precipice.
They know that any transgression could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was uncovered years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they pass through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, exhausted by the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set a little lower, at 1,800 feet [1,850 m].
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never to say the least, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euro) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As is normal to carry 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip", explains Anto, who usually carries three bags a day.
It takes three hours in each and ends up being ground, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it may seem a misery for such an inhumane effort, it's triple what I would earn on the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) ", explains the porter, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulty, constant coughing and irritated eyes by toxic gases
At 27, Anto has been playing hide-and-seek at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already begun to pass him bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, difficulty breathing, constant coughing, and irritated eyes by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this nice, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden cabin with other carrier, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur keeps on burning at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lit up with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry the sulfur baskets over their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supplied any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at such a weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) extra fee per camera that, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance fee, the guards of this nature park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people", protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old hard-working porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged between 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and tears the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that emerge from the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of serious illness beyond their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and shoulder sores, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Waving the basket over his back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos at 53.
Each day, he and his colleagues remove 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away, along a goat path between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life", Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, aged 30, also works as a sulfur loader.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates generation after generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: the one that the human mules of Kawah Ijen do.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (ball) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill "their national duty".
This is purely internet stuff, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew the government had tried many things, like throwing pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it's because of "better education" and "a broader range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and to delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decreased birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a European immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is a lot of barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's ruling party experienced its worst electoral result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says that their "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the central financial district seems like they're not going to have much effect.
"People are under a lot of stress, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off", says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important to me to have my own money and time", says another young man in his early 20's.
Men and women cite their career, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons why they are unable to have children.
So as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans have the final say.
Private offline is private online
- I'm not here.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy's Dictionary, it is the quality of private life or "the area of private life that is entitled to be protected from any intrusion".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How do you apply this definition to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you're exposed to by venturing online situations you probably wouldn't share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys aged 10 to 15 who were frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very personal", on the personal level, and "in the user's key and name", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not be posted", says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone", she says.
I upload pictures of pretty things on FB or games.
I also hang out with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or of someone who's making a fool of myself", she says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, naked people, crimes, or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother's included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them", he adds.
"Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly", he says.
He would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't even listen to someone who recommended you to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admitting not to know 20 of the people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example", he says.
According to the boy, no one has insinuated or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I was pressured or demanded, I simply took my sacks off my account", he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine's acquaintance was being blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was", she says.
Victim, according to Jose, didn't close the account.
"Just gave him privacy".
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I would if I didn't like it or if I was attracted to it.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying", he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it is important to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game changed", he says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master's in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are themselves, the children and youth who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still learning", he says.
He says the issue is complex, "because we're asking them to have a definite criterion on what is or is not appropriate to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that".
"Also, be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless", he adds.
Here are some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like a photo of you posted like the one you posted of a friend?
You know what the others are publishing about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask permission from other people to tag them?
And one more, do you all need to know what you're doing every minute?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, so must social media", he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential that parents read social media policies with awareness.
By understanding each of the incisions, they have solid foundations for talking to their children about the implications of opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published", he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
Unasur summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending presidents.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources from the Chancellery and the Presidency pointed out that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later they said that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When asked about the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information at the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the silent video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, audio restricted".
The little information circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is Humala's pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite press pressing demands, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not even circulated.
The official website of ASPA confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited information collection to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru's joint commitment to accept a ruling by the Hague Court settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will accept and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today", Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts", added Piñera, and saluted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the judgments of that international court, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was held with the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and action lines were set for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residency".
He said that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand the productive matrix and to see a better future for our peoples", added Humala.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas...by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the cross-axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve its reincorporation into the Union of South American Nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbors was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaragua counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a CIJ ruling, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We will review all these roads, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
"Suramérica must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramérica, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who took part in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of Unasur.
"We must get the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also supported the re-composition of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for demanding that it submit to interrogation in its territory for a suspected sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done via videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", the Ecuadorian president said.
What is certain is that you may be in danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being confined to a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates anyone's health", he added.
Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting him a safe passage to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London seeking a solution to the WikiLeaks founder's closure.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant conversations.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances", he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives the safe tomorrow, this is over".
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interviews him via Skype tomorrow morning, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which degrade freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this regard, he congratulated himself on the fact that it is no longer these journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and he said that if re-elected he would "deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and the legality-covered coup" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
That ruling is not being adhered to at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We have to process them extensively to get over them and move on.
He also expressed confidence in a good conclusion of the litigation on maritime boundaries that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "it is correct for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accepting a ruling no matter how hard it may be".
Referring to the possibility that he is a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees that possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win it would be my last term as president and we're out of public life.
If we lose anyway.
"It's a decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the health status of President Chávez", he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to have tested positive for AIDS.
"It was like a bomb dropped on me", he recalls the time of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "slightly softer", with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
She decided to take care of her illness alone and began to learn about it; with such commitment that she already celebrated her 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut".
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, many still arrive when the virus has already wrecked havoc, "depressed" their immune system and become victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years since the onset of AIDS in the world, at least among the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to the fact that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation of the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple terms, the above means that those who are diagnosed HIV positive at the age of 25 under these terms "as long as they remain in control they can live without problems until they are 75", the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNICEF's annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have occurred since May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very early because they don't know their infection status, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong indication: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection, what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, to offer mass screening tests to all people who need it".
In their proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) also agree, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory to get tested, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better go three times a week", they say no to me.
The change was to get better, eat well, exercise, take medication.
To date, all her parents know is that she had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
They get tested, if they're at risk, they get to know if they're HIV positive, it's better, and if they're already diagnosed, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, your message, sums up the slogan of the 2012 AIDS battle.
Condoms behind the counter
The gap between health programs and the common citizen is huge, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from the state of Taptio who has taken over the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places devoted to this task "effectively the distribution of condoms has increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one hundred, and that's very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, who do not have access to a condom", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sorna and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and healthcare personnel, to which teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms should not be just behind the counter and that those hundred be in public bathroom delivery stations of the places where young people frequent.
It's not about motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, when asked if he would have distributed condoms in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already have sex", he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks fourth nationally in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are in the bloodstream and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about the virus.
Ratified by a US appeals court a ruling that ignores the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be argued that the survival guarantee procedures for the signatories permitted by Mexican law are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In practice, the backlash against the June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless from the possibility of seizing their properties on the Bravo River.
However, the resolution opens the door for the leading glassmaker in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case notes that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the main proceedings are the commercial competition in Mexico.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of transnational firms.
In fact, to that end the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, with the American Law Institute as its arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without the vote intercompany, which had recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts of the subsidiaries of Vitro with their parent company, would not have achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, the Vitro case was not the first to accept the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth is that, by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the US courts, i.e. the "butter" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have won a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal omits this fact.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 onwards, besides the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the country's collections.
For the time being, the signature of the González Sada family will interpose a reconsideration appeal before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the full of this one, that is, the five judges, since they only voted three.
If this fails, Cerciorare's appeal will be filed, requiring a review of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court upheld a document sent by the Mexican government under the form of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competition Act, noting that Vitro was unsealed with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to match it with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It also notes that the country followed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules for crossborder insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-sided carambola: they beat Vitro and they beat the country.
The balance sheet
While the Mexican Airlines' unions had been lying on the table for several months, the Association of Union Air Pilots (Association Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores) had already found the bottleneck against the company's former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration.
The court headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Value Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexican de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're close to the Dragon Mart.
Gathered this weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a shelter zone for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that ravaged some protected areas and raised the mother of all the brothers against the industry.
The ACTA is dead.
The government has raised a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Commercial Agreement Antifalsification, known in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility of it as an attack on freedom of expression on social media.
Homex for the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, home developer Homex is placing 500 million pesos of Stock Exchange Certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones offering to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive birth
Integrated by the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with a competitive social basis has just been born, whose objective will be the service market of the software clusters of Central and South America.
Investments in the field exceed $1.5 trillion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball worlds Hector "Hetin" Reyes was linked to the sport of table tennis for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the entire world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as extensive as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a minor league player, a National Senior Basketball player, a controlling and manager in the BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s", Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life".
Reyes doesn't overdo that assertion.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia denoting his extensive career, bear witness to it.
Bayamons in the heart
Of all of these, the ones he treasures most with emotion are those that recall his passage through the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years serving as co-owner or franchise owner.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a controlling, co-controlling or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator", Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember you saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, since by 1988 it was already a federal mandate.
By then, he'd rather enjoy his performances and Mincy's in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came in fourth place and it must have been bronze if it wasn't for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Cup group is the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won us bronze at the worlds.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but it also had younger (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the mess of the Pan American Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who's been the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt that was Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has mastered that level as Piculin did.
And that's not to mention his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who has been the best Boricuan leader?
That's very difficult.
We've had a very good run that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I like Leo Arill's work very much.
What do you consider your greatest accomplishment in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, like the regionalisation of the smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce's boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and coursework for managers, desk officers and referees.
I'm pleased to hear that.
What are you doing now?
Most of what I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he portrayed an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most", the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, caring, and talented, and I'm going to miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, she was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", aired by the NBC network from 1965 to 1970.
In it, she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him in his home.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Her film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that brought Hagman to his height of stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate anticipation around an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to cut her out of the city unless she left town, but others also had motive to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), admitted.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s gravestone", Hagman said in 1988.
You should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of Dallas aired a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
Five of the episodes for season two had already been completed and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no immediate ruling from Warner or TNT on how the series would handle Hagman's loss.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had it in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought was going to hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant she became an organ donor and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and afterwards", he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's gonna be a little awkward for a while, but you're gonna be okay".
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course exploring the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, which many people have held on to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "dead Armageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If you look at what's been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on "the end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time", he said, "and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior".
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could trigger a war.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what's possible, likely, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option of teaching the course again, in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end", Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It saturated in two hours", Restall said of his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old graduate student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he's seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that", he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said they believed the December 21 expiration date.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we somehow discredited it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he pointed out that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge of these speculations.
"Otherwhere people don't think about this", he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there have been many references to the final judgment days, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they planned to go to "the end of the world" parties.
"Maybe you should call some friends and have a laugh with them", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
