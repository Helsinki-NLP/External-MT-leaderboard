Foodstuffs are responsible for European inflation
The main reason for the inflation rate in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistics Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the rate of interest, which it believes would favour rising commodity prices and a slight decline in unemployment.
The ECB is committed to keeping inflation below 2%, or at least close to the 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a dilemma: inflation must be "dealt with" to avoid further action.
In November, Germany's inflation rate reached a 12-year high of 3.3 percent; in Spain, it climbed from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone is due to rising food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat prices rose 88% and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
In 2007 there was also a significant increase in the price of food oils and dairy products.
The world market price of crude oil rose 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
The ECB estimates that inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next three to four months, analysts expect a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup detects a government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support has grown significantly by the beginning of December, the first time since 2002 that the party has held the largest base camp, while the support for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference between the three parties is evident in the strong determination of the opposition: more than two thirds (71%) are opposed to a fifth (20%) of voters for the MSCP.
The survey shows that MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry barrier: they represent 2% of the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has increased by one percent.
Compared to the previous low, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "fairly bad".
After a hopeful outlook for spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration; only one tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historic high - rated the prime minister's work as "rather bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have high confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters of Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% who distrust the head of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be controlled even without a change of government.
If 35% of the population voted to remain in government and head of government after the unrest last October, today that number is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) only sees a solution in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said they would "probably" participate, and another 20 percent would "probably" vote.
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, only 55% would "certainly" go to the polls, while another 15% would consider their participation "likely".
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the tuition fee and 84% against the hospital fee.
If the group of people who took part in the referendum were to be considered 'certainly', the proportion of those who opposed tuition, internship and hospital fees would be 81, 84 and 89%, respectively.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaersk area also maintained an average price increase of 16% this year from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Napi article from Gazdaság
In the Budaer trade triangle, the price of the usual "Napi" Christmas basket has also increased by 16 percent this year, but prices have increased by over HUF 1,000 in all hypermarkets.
After prices in food markets 'devalue' last December, the rate of inflation has not fallen dramatically compared with the already high initial level.
However, it is certainly discouraging to consumers that what they paid for last year, which was still well below HUF 9,000, is not even available for HUF 10 000 this year.
The price of the 'Napi' cart exceeded the magical limit of HUF 10,000 by at least HUF 91 in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10.573.
(In 6800 the price was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while prices for purse breast fillets, nuts and corn rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to figures from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but Auchan had 1 kg of bread for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price drop to below FUR 200 for the product.
Also surprising was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink, including the pledge, cost only 257 HUF.
Still, this year's Napi shopping cart comparison cut Auchan the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the Napi shopping cart by 15 percent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased prices by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest cart of the previous year and the most expensive one of today was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest cart of the previous year and the most expensive one of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1.480.00.
The average price increase last year was still forint 1,206.00, but the increase in VAT on prices last Christmas was noticeable.
This is precisely what has affected trade: it seems that the stores have not been able to decide correctly which price range to apply to each item, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the trader does not plan well for the speed of a product, he may lose substantial gains in the price range based on traffic intensity.)
In addition, the price of the 'Napi' basket was so drastic last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of Forint 1720 in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only Forint 844.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost forint 1,630.00 more than the previous year, and even the cheapest price increased forint 1,284.00.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there has been a disastrous price increase, with the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office recorded an increase in price over 30% over a 12-month period.
(Somewhere alongside flour, eggs.)
However, if you look at the Napi basket, this seems almost impossible in the latter, as the price level of the expensive product already in the previous year, even in the worst case, has risen by barely more than 10%.
Clearly, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the quick suppliers - at least they were able to reverse the sharp increase in prices on the multis.
The hypermarkets do not complain in the golden triangle; good years are reported on a regular basis.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices.
They buy in large quantities, and sustainable food is packed in palette over the shop's tables.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless snakes at the cash register in all three department stores when the number of customers exploded.
However, the country has reported a lower customer rate, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even reach their planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are being saved
More than a thousand infections were reported in hospitals in the past year due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not particularly beneficial for the control of infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, disinfectants are also being saved.
In the trauma department of János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was found in a male patient who was admitted to hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection here.
The man who was injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but soon afterwards he had to return with an MRSA infection, and an important operation could not be carried out because of the bacteria still in the patient's body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1,094 infections from hospitals caused by multi-resistant pathogens had been reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been safely registered in hospitals, but the dark numbers are likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, which is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their noses without causing disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat infections, tonsillitis, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the drugs are overdosed or used improperly, the antibiotic-resistant bacteria that respond well and spread quickly in hospitals under appropriate conditions will be produced.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently dysfunctional immune systems, but also in older or low-weight patients, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, or sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is not a special disease, as such incidents are part of the daily life of the hospital.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA is not present only where it is not sought.
Antibiotic resistant
"These patients are isolated, care workers wear rubber gloves and masks, and we have the antibiotics to treat them", says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are screened for MRSA upon admission to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is too rare
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable to curb the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients being treated and isolate MRSA infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not as common in Hungarian hospitals.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant a grant to the scheme.
Most cases are therefore only reported when the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
The European Union has strong recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease patterns.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always followed by hospitals.
Among outpatients or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even less common, says Karolina Böröcz.
Savings in disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by the healthcare professionals.
This is why handwashing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by either drop infection or contact, but in home hospitals, it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, with beds almost in a row, although epidemiologically, there should be at least a distance of 1.5 metres between them.
As Karolina Böröcz notes, unfortunately, even in financially less well-off hospitals, disinfectant savings are being made, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that almost favor the emergence of infections.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the dangers of the use of the drug.
Government programme against MRSA
Managing MRSA infections is costing health insurance companies enormously, so they're being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment has been included in the government programme.
The programme is showing early signs of success - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
The death squad chief was not drunk.
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the Chief of Police of the XXII District, the official report is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither drunk nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest Prosecutor General's Office, said on Friday after the official report on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation that the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The former police chief drove his own car into Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, and overtook a 55-year-old man crossing the road at an unmarked spot.
(However, according to the StVO this is not a mild circumstance - the driver has secondary status even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip.)
The pedestrian died of his injuries after being admitted to hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, resigned afterwards and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Prosecutor's Office has opened its investigation into the incident.
Moreover, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements totalling EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday, with the money to go to education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework in 2006 to finance transport and environmental projects financed by grants from the Cohesion Fund.
The EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be used to finance education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will be mainly used for research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the subway line 4.
It was agreed that once Hungary had agreed with the EU the details of subway financing, the original contract and any modifications would be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary totalling EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is EURIBOR-linked and the loan is provided by the EIB with an eight-year grace period, without any provisions.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is looking closely at the formerly seldom mentioned Balkan state.
What, where and who is buying in the EU's still cheapest market, which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought-after real estate market in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, while Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sunshine Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the most popular, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena and Triavna, and the highly favorable region of Russia will also attract more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf destinations in Europe, attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foreseeable investors are therefore already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also want to change their lifestyle.
Most of the buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties for 50 to 100 000 euros, or fallen houses for 5 to 15 000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility, as well as communication opportunities, are highly valued, but proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are also crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December as one of the top ten German holiday destinations).
The third group is made up of businessmen who invest with the aim of medium to long-term value-adding.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming more expensive, driven by ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been a 21 per cent annual price increase.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is a heated debate going on between industrial and developing countries.
The United States has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but it would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries was also reached.
The Kyoto Protocol adaptation fund will be managed by a 16-member Council, expected to be part of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as set out in the 'Piac et profit' section.
Hungary 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for the Environment, Gábor Fodor, supports the EU's commitment to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (at 1990 levels) by 2020 regardless of whether the 'post-2012 agreement' is achieved successfully or not.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8% with its 15 Member States at the time.
The requirement for Hungary is a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared with 1985-87 - a requirement which the country will certainly meet, as the Ministry of the Environment's press release shows.
The commitment is high on Bali - at least the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol's reduction plans would not be followed by a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the UN's Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Committee on Climate Change in its recent report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and increase the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, leading to extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army is advertising on YouTube
British Army units have posted video footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the RAF has discovered YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The images taken with miniature cameras mounted on helmets are checked at Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London where they are posted online.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The UK Ministry of Defence was registered as 'defenceheadquarters' in the spring of 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally published the videos to recruit soldiers, and the Department of Defense says the contributions are also intended to inform the public about the real goals of foreign operations.
This kind of propaganda is almost free of charge compared to traditional television commercials, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message as they confirm the legitimacy of the government's military measures in their own way.
Americans are advertising with play
But the army must also fight amateur footage that, in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage, also makes it online - such as those showing the deaths of soldiers: the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films talk about the losses at the highest level, but the bloody sides of war are not shown.
By the way, many videos of war in Iraq and Afghanistan have been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre".
The Americans, however, are promoting the slightly different way, namely with the free-to-download shooter game "America's Army", in which the player can sneak into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-affirming simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is not a bit of a sleaze: instead of a Christmas party, she is hosting a working conference where her staff can end 2007 with coffee and pomegranate.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant the Christmas spirit with a tombola or a kick in the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken hold.
The biggest Christmas party of any ministry will be held at the defence resort this year, but the staff of the ministry are not expected to attend.
The "Christmas of the Orphans" is a day when children are given gifts by fallen soldiers, the "Mission Day" is a day when family members are welcomed by soldiers currently stationed abroad, and there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for the festivities.
Compared to other resorts, the National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are struggling.
The 4.32 million forint Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
While the focus of the festivities is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a Tombola lottery.
The National Development Agency (NFU) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the home of the National Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The salami was forint 1 million, the rest being spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a NFU department is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) with EU funds.
The building of the "Vígszínház" was rented for the celebration.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the authorities.
What's with the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to NFU guests but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
About 500 people came to the ball.
The ceremony was opened with a speech by the Minister, followed by a live music dance after dinner.
At the request of [origo] it was reported that there was no obligation to wear a ball gown or costume at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Self-Government are preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health is organising the celebration for the staff in its own four walls for about 400,000 forints.
The Minister for Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is officially inviting her staff not to a Christmas party but to the annual sound conference.
According to the press department, the party will be attended by about 180 guests, who will be served with only coffee and pomegranates.
The Minister of State Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply attack the hall of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organising a Christmas party in its own party hall, which is expected to attract 436 employees.
The expenditure was estimated at 2,500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incentives.
Since the beginning of the presidency of János Veres, the PM's staff have celebrated this every year.
However, there will be no proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the Minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture is inviting a New Year's Eve reception on 20 January, the Ministry's Christmas celebration is due to expire this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort's information, the cost is estimated at 1,000 forints per guest.
The press department reports that it will be a very simple reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
The receptions held each year traditionally begin with a short speech by the Minister and end with a restraining frown.
As the corresponding press outlets report at [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is being held at the Museum of Arts and Crafts.
More and more forces are mobilized for a massive strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike starting on Monday.
A general protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and the strike will begin on Monday, the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act.
Strike-related significant traffic congestion is expected as rail traffic is almost completely halted and Budapest public transport operators (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A strike committee for the LIGA-MOSZ is also set up to coordinate the actions on Monday.
A general protest meeting will be held on Saturday and, from Monday onwards, all organisations which join the strike will cease work indefinitely unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, was not defined.
If the National Council does not approve the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
The Commission has already decided to adopt a new policy on health insurance, which is to be implemented in the future.
The strike, which will begin on Monday, will have to face significant traffic obstacles: railway workers will be laid off indefinitely, most public transport will be silent in the morning and more than half of Volán's communities will be silent.
At the same time, there will be one-way traffic jams in many places.
The call for strike was followed by numerous unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is updated on the League website.
Some organisations have announced indefinite strikes, others plan temporary layoffs.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement on sufficient services had been reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Union of Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people were travelling on the train just around Christmas.
According to reports, the BKVs are on strike from start to finish at 1 p.m. and at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m. and the LIGA electricity and heat unions are on strike for four hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike at different times nationwide, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is on strike for two hours.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and present a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The third requirement is that eligible occupational groups be given access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which is part of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport for the sub-lines and is now demanding a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded in August with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that the highest political risk in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard is the "increasing of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely to provoke such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the political authorities: 'Public figures have left the discussion of Roma issues to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition.'
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremists and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also considers that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "have significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, particularly in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We recall that since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been on a continuous rise, so that since summer 2007, several organisations have been established calling themselves "National Self-Defense Association".
"The common thread between these groups is that they define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly boasting that they prepare their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (disaster protection, national defense, law enforcement), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself", it said.
And furthermore, all this is done according to that method which tries to disguise various political endeavours based on the political and party craziness of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on civil character and the organisation of the association is therefore not only used to overcome legal obstacles that may arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also increase the risk of developing relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, and some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as a confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region.'
The establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, and the political risk to the whole region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The Bulgarian Guard was created in the wake of the Roma mass riots in a neighbourhood of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as the basis for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the purpose of the organisation is 'national protection'.
In her opinion, in the past 17 years, there has been a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, Political Capital says.
And furthermore, the initiative would have sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced the establishment of their own guards for resistance purposes.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, so it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, says the risk warning report from Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and, should risk-changing trends be visible, public opinion would be informed, as in the case of the risk warning report.
Holidays aren't holidays everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of rearranging working days around the holidays has now become established, but we will have fewer such days in the coming year.
In the European Union and in America, too, "holiday" is understood differently.
The Hungarian legal system makes a distinction between public holidays and working days.
Public holidays are usually church holidays or associated with important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year, for example: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are days off work - the latter alone allows New Year celebrants to rest.
We have a total of fourteen holidays throughout the year.
The national holidays are March 15, which commemorates the 1848 Revolution, and October 23, the anniversary of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20th, the founding of the state, on May 1st, the celebration of work, on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our public, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shifting" has proved to be effective in cases where we would work just one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
The date on which the day before or after the holiday is to be finally worked out has been decided by the Minister of Labour in his own regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public servants and civil servants.
Except for companies and establishments where the operation is carried on without interruption, including on public holidays.
This year, the work order will only be somewhat disturbed by the end-of-year holidays: from 24 December onwards, life in this country will remain in a formal state, as most people take the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in a time-balance or the holiday cancelled for that purpose.
The Commission has also proposed that the number of holidays falling in the middle of the week or at the end of the week next year should be higher, so that there will be fewer redistributions of working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the workday so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day, so that Friday 2 May can be a rest day.
The second change is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, work will have to be done in advance on Friday 24 October.
The end of the year will be a defining holiday, however, as everything will be in place and will remain in place from 24 December onwards, even if New Year falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary little things to annoy coworkers
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive -- harmless lies that we don't even notice anymore: they bring color to everyday workplace life.
The question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or whether you better take up the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstood, annoying situations consciously.
- I'll give you some tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called", says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by calling the marketing department and repentingly confessing that you forgot to target the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, consider how to make your colleague feel really uncomfortable and try to avoid those situations consciously.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more nerve-wracking than reaching for a document, office supplies, or a phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday, the bookshelf was still on the desk - is it gone this morning?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, you shouldn't borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find something is missing.
So, don't put any envelopes or mail from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you, no more if you need it so badly.
What about the private lives of the colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a nonsense that has already been put into the world.
Who's who, what's done?
Where and why?
If possible, you should not stick your colleagues' personal information (or assumptions) to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret, we shouldn't abuse that trust!
It is best to keep quiet like a grave rather than to address those who are not present, even if others are aware of the colleague's problems.
No reason to report sick?
If you call the office to report sick because you have a headache, because you're feeling unwell or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, untimely tasks, scheduled projects, now your colleagues have to do them instead of you.
So don't play the bad guy.
If you know the day before that you won't make it to the office the next day, or that something might get in the way that will keep you at home, you should report it in time so that neither your colleagues nor your boss will be unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
♪ I'm not gonna let you know ♪
You're just getting into your work, but suddenly you're disturbed by the loud jokes of the female colleagues?
You don't want to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not annoy your colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which you can have over their heads), trampling, constant sneering, or snoring.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deeply involved in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the others' fault?
If a project is not finished on time, if you forget to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look to others for the blame for your own forgetting!
If possible, do not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others have been affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or how to recover the missed one is just too appropriate!
In the office, a feeling of home?
Training pants and slippers: comfortable for home, but not lost in the office!
Even if the workplace would allow you to dress so lightly, you shouldn't!
Just don't be too sloppy - you should respect your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress appropriately in the office - if you want, even beautifully and elegantly!
Trying to make it right for everyone - or how to be uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
The radio is sounding a strange melody: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The tempo changes, the bass comes to the sounds of the past, and the real sound jewel is a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which is on mr2.
The local music scene hasn't been so enthralled with high-quality electropop for a long time.
But now you can even see the traffic differently when you hear Zagar's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, such a new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene, is slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even as garage rock is back in with its guitar quintet, local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing in the band Yonderboi himself, before he - perhaps because a hostel can't stand two pipes - started to make his own way.
He made his breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which blends elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, but only when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Season" by Ferenc Török.
The band, which initially performed in smaller clubs, became known to the wider public only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album in 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, was the only trendsetter to be able to market in the West.
Zagar and his band were undoubtedly "trendy", but no one cared if they liked to wear that mark.
The band responded as they should, with a new, even better album.
The new album, "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", could open up new avenues for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pecser years.
The term comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying sound would be fine, but besides the ethereal nature of the music, the more vocal guitar, which is in keeping with the spirit and trends of the times, is also influenced by rock 'n' roll.
These songs were introduced by the English singer György Ligeti, who lives and works with the band "The Puzzle", at the premiere in Millenáris.
One song from the album even made it to radio stations - the latest from early to late pop music broadcaster mr2 Petőfi has successively set the ear to the ear with the song "Wings of Love", recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So, is everything okay?
The H.G.U. has been asking about Balázs's Zságer.
HH: This new hit raises the question: How much of your music is reserved for a certain class?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't really mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be subtle and insignificant, but it can also be produced for sale, which makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also be made from an honest motive.
The reception of the listener also works according to this principle, regardless of language and country boundaries.
Hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
For example, in foreign countries, especially in the West, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only are teenagers or twens going to concerts, but the older audience is going to them.
They're more aware of the trends in pop music that are happening around them, because they also consider them part of contemporary culture.
What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
For example, it's a good feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
Music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a purpose.
The role of the audience is most often felt at concerts where there is already a mutual interaction, but this is only seen in the untouchable changes of the moment.
But I've noticed that if you want to make it right for everyone, you're no longer interesting.
How far do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a solo artist and he's built his career in the West.
For example, we don't really go his way, except for the fact that you keep trying to interpret it into our music.
We see ourselves more as team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons between our work and Yonderboi's were inevitable, as several of us left his band and took a different path.
In Mr2 Petőfi's charts, "Wings of Love" is number one.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged in a slightly more popular style toward a wider audience?
For example, we had no plans to write a hit song that would be a draw for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the album's final cut, to help us solve the sound orgy and the more difficult issues.
How did you pick the six female singers?
Why exactly her, what was the guiding principle?
For example, the basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together a choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir was born - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later dubbed "Underground Divas".
Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls co-write it?
For example, the number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that the number needed something else.
The chord sequence formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the tune that night, and later they taught the girls.
It came almost instantly and terribly spontaneously.
I remember I was pretty electrified back then, but it needed the Divas.
With my voice alone, the song would never have gotten so powerful.
HHG: But both on the record and at the concert, it was the impression that the girls were in the background.
There's no solo part (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing perfectly together, and they're no louder than the music, so their singing isn't just accompanied by the music.
They were backstage, too.
Is it the intention?
For example, they were standing in the back because of technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The point is to forget your ego a little bit, forget who came from and where is going, let us just let those specific wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wish others could feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was written.
What was the most elaborate song?
For example, in the musical creation work, there was actually no one, there were more difficult tasks in mixing.
Like "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play a concert piano, or "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't work anymore, but it gradually came together like a puzzle.
What's your favorite song from the new album?
For example, this is changing with the concerts going on and now that I've "left" the album.
Right now, it's "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth", and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent Broker Risked Billions for Feeling Misunderstood
The Landless Betrayer
This is what Jerome Kerviel, a former employee of the French banking giant Société Générale, who owns the local Komerční banka, calls it.
Because she came for him with almost five billion euros.
But it seems more likely that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and he certainly wasn't incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he was able to recognize the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's more mentally weak", his superiors said, reporting him to the police.
But as Kerviels' statements in the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, show, he was a man who made a profit of 1.6 billion euros in business at the end of last year.
The crisis is not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he said in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed to earn half a billion euros just during the American crisis.
He had already anticipated the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first reports that so-called subprime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had problems with their payments, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that and he was right.
By the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain it", Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely had nothing to keep to himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits to faking documents so people wouldn't catch up.
He even managed to keep his bosses in the spotlight, even as the Eurex became interested in his business.
Risk and profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't know.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank".
How did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a realtor, and in 2005, he became an independent realtor with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"Even when I first spoke in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development", Kerviel explained to the investigating officers.
But soon after he entered, the first big success came.
He made a lot of money from the Alliance's stock, betting half a billion euros on the loss of the title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger -- now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball", he told the policeman.
But the bosses were supposed to know everything, or even suspect it.
"As long as I was making money, they closed their eyes".
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find out?
He made himself suspicious on vacation.
"I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn't take leave is one who doesn't want to be looked at", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic may have a chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programmes which will bring the Czech Republic to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns are coming from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will receive about 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will go into transportation development.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money is in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The 'Enterprise and Innovation' programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and firms raise funds for innovative enterprises.
The aim is to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for business research and for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful new applicant countries in acquiring EU funds so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year prison sentence for former presidents
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of $100 million in financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda in the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of the Central American state will return to the grid is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials to let Alemán serve his sentence at home or to put him in prison.
Four years ago, a court found that Alemán regularly transferred government money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 campaign.
The budget is
Yes, it is done.
The state budget is approved.
What's so special about this house?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted and was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year's proposal was approved with the support of the Social Democrats (CSSD) because it had been submitted by Minister Sobotka (from that party) and the CSSD could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives passed this traditionally little-observed, yet very important law in silence.
That's a paradox, in a way.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is covered up by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciated subject for the media, and they are paying more attention to it.
A dispute between politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The national budgets suffered from three weaknesses under the previous Social Democratic governments that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure which is legally compulsory, not only in terms of pensions but also in terms of social expenditure, which the "silent" coalition of the ČSSD and the KSČM (Communists) decided on last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat controlled.
But the real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors, in addition to their tax, tax and bank loans, used unconscious debt to create additional sources of investment, often over-indebted their council houses.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by selling in large quantities shares in the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state in the course of privatisation.
Now that source is already gone.
As far as we're concerned, we're only going to be able to look at official and verifiable facts.
For several years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been undergoing a period of growth that the CZSDR boasts of continuously.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to get their public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have far more reasonable economies than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, and it is mostly due to the previous governments.
We are among the countries with the lowest poverty risk globally.
We are therefore not in need of massive social programmes, which have unfortunately been excessively inflated on a gigantic scale in recent years.
Even if some of the absurd populist spending that was passed before the elections this year has been removed, it is clear that unless there is a shift in retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, practically all politics in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain but pure administration.
It is only a little exaggerated to say that then the ruling politicians will become officials who will mechanically divide the bulk of tax revenues into pensions and social spending.
This year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the suppression of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner for 2008 would be superfluous if the previous governments had not spent what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not want the fact that the ruling politicians will become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and this coalition government, which is not too strong but is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to on taxes and fees, wish for rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will allow for the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
Banks want to deal with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will be auctioned into the currency markets.
In these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the US Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, another 24 billion is making it easier for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of each country have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest difficulties facing the economy, namely the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend", Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consultancy wrote in a report to his clients.
"Central banks' coordinated action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%", Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already lost about 60 billion dollars due to unsecured loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more to be lost.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what else could happen when they decided to take this step", said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad", he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing bonds, their customers will find credit more expensive.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used for lending money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had cut interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates", said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting at Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks will contribute to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President. - The next item is the report (Doc.
The criticism now referred to the UN's end of the international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he argued that the ecologists' debates were incredible.
Klaus said that not only was the structure of the conference unacceptable, which was a strange mix of government officials and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanied it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a fireworks display that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in presenting his book that the subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book was published in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views".
So now interested parties could read his attitude without distorting it.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he felt he had sufficient qualifications to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to understand and evaluate professional papers, has experience in statistics and is also an economist.
The main thesis of the book was that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consensus among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore pose no threat, and that efforts to influence climate change development are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, he considers it unacceptable, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, to impose unproven views on others, and he regards this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield".
Klaus had spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's licenses
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for a change so that the authorities can issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
The Ministry is not concerned that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will take to the streets without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, the majority of drivers who do not want to drive have not changed their driver's license.
While small towns are reporting a sharp drop in interest in the voucher exchange, the capital's offices are flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange has grown this week.
The city administration processes around 2000 customers a day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
The issuance of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete the required changeover by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license face a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But the police can also have it handled with a warning.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may be increased to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even those who do not drive at all can be punished by the community.
He could be fined up to 30,000 crowns, they said.
The Ministry has already called on the authorities to make concessions and impose a maximum fine of 1000 crowns.
But according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns fine.
The driving licence is a document where everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a valid ID card that everyone needs.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers are gradually having to change other types of driving licences.
People with driver's licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to switch.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 shall end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court decreases penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of colluding with the David Berdych gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Prague Superior Court, in a final judgment, reduced their sentence by one or two years.
Initially, the "Office for Combating Organized Crime" had 14 and 12 years of prison sentences.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only a review at the Supreme Court is possible.
Mr Berdych himself is accused in this case, but he is facing a first instance judgment.
However, he had already been sentenced to a total of 16 years in other trials.
He can't be condemned any more.
A district court found 19 people guilty in January of involvement in robberies, the Oberlandesgericht hearing today the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants denied the charge from the beginning, arguing that it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers, in consultation with Berdych, provided information from police sources, covered up various robberies, and helped gang members escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the loot.
The charges relate to the gang's crimes from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, often with serious injuries to victims, but also for holding office and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, police discovered illegal pistols, steel-plated ammunition, a laser-guided telescope and a machine gun.
The gang has been accused of raiding the property for millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this case, courts found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet gone to court.
The main proceedings have so far been closed to Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and awaiting final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
The lawyer for the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns of compensation from the hospital in Třebíč plus court costs for the transfer of children to a maternity ward.
For each mother, three million, for each father, two million, for each child, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent couple.
The hospital's lawyer, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees with Velebas' proposal altogether.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high", Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But to be able to form an opinion on this counterproposal, we need the opinion that the other side has produced.
We'll see if it's worth it at all.
We are convinced that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together", Dostál stressed.
He said the amount would be between 100 000 and 200 000 kronor for each of the four parents.
At first, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
Veleba was informed by the University Hospital in Prague Motol that the compensation negotiations were based on an opinion.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the children's parents suffered mental damage and stress symptoms of varying degrees of severity and depth.
The men were better able to handle the stressful situation, even though they were accused of having prevented the confusion of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are dealing with the aftermath of the trauma they have experienced and with what is happening now.
Veronika and Nikola switched nurses from the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
The district head of Vysočina (Bohemian-Mauritanian High) handed over at the end of October to each family 100000 krona to compensate for the expenses incurred by the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is the district's responsibility.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the law for liability.
In case of doubt, they must contact a reserve fund, except exceptionally where they can request assistance from the holder.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low damages to the victims, which have been determined by tables and have been in the range of hundreds of thousands, with exceptions for millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolekívka lost the dispute over the "Kingdom of Wallachia" trademark.
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the title "Wallachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
But according to his lawyer, the case is not likely to be closed and his client will likely appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr Harabiš and his team want to parasitize on the popularity of Bolek Polívka", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
Everyone thought of this actor and comedian when he said "The Wallachian Kingdom".
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"We've been working for almost ten years.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the laws of the Member States on the approximation of the laws of the law on the approximation of the law on the approximation of the law on the approximation of the law on the approximation of the law on the approximation of the law on the approximation of the law on the approximation of the law on the law on the approximation of the law on the law on the approximation of the law on the law on the law on the use of the law on the use of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the Member States is.
He says the reason is a fight over money.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and that they could have some of it too.
They want to win parasitically at our work", he continued.
The business of the profits
According to the court, Polívka first used the title "King of Wallachians" in one of his television programs.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that had nothing to do with the idea of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From an initially fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined in the founding of the company "The Wallachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature on the passports and even offered discounts on visits to his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš used only the idea that Polívka had made public in the Manege show for his business intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom", the judge said.
She added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had been intensely dedicated to it.
The cooperation between the parties that are now divided lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organised the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But since then, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have been building up, culminating in the inscription "King Boleslav I. Elected" until the day of Saint Nimmerleins.
The role of leader was then taken on by Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearness in the dispute could lead to the race for the throne and half a princess prepared by Harabiš.
It would produce a new king.
He didn't want to give details and a date.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be something like the royal parade in the Wallachia.
The king was to be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also sign up", Harabiš added.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: the front parts are disappearing
To tell you the truth, I was never a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not very valuable, and the quality of the gear, steering and even processing could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it's much better.
The SW van is a long way off, and I just have to reconsider.
For example, when I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I complained about the low headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints are no longer present, because the body of the van is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Keep going
I'll just go through the interior, so I don't repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty successful design, where I only object to the silver-colored middle tunnel.
I'd welcome a little more design where the car would otherwise make such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or head rests.
The page content has also improved considerably compared to 206.
As for the space available, the enlarged dimensions of the body can be felt here as well.
The aforementioned lack of headroom is also eliminated in the van.
Bags in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the loading room.
I must say that it is very comfortable and space-saving (also because of the folding rear window).
The caverns are equipped with fences that represent an ideal compromise.
They are non-interfering, detachable, and hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
The basic equipment is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, this is not the case in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is well behind by a noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when you are buying a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positive aspects, I must mention the very flat cargo compartment or the very low cargo edge after the rear seats are folded.
120 hp in four series
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and a power output of 88 kWp.
And frankly, this is what a 1600 cubic engine should look like to drive a family hatchback.
It's quiet, low-consumption, and moves well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Skoda, who sometimes seems to have his exhaust clogged with a lapel, I can only be excited about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329 900 kroner is still on the table.
With our engine, it costs 410 900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car is again a huge hit, with a further £80,000.
But we had headlight bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc-wiper shutdown, electric window lifts in the back and...
So the car costs a total of just 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but if you add up the extra equipment of a fab and you get a very similar sum.
So all that remains is the choice of brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is failing
In the UK, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which raises concerns amongst the local community about the further development of local school systems.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has thus far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even report cases of increased violence in the conflict between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is illustrated in the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the local population and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and bullying among students have spread to the relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed to such an extent that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The defendant claimed that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after two minor girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks and stoned the man.
"On our way home, a boy climbed a bush and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then blew his ass off", one mother of a Slovak student told The Times of another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One local even described the dispute with the Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are reported to have come here looking for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba - The Most Beautiful Island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it will come true if you just choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves or a sea that's calm like a pond.
Palm and all inclusive with waiters on the beach offering pizza, ice cream and charming cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands, you can find this in abundance.
But there is only one island where you can find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana was once a transit camp of treasures that the Spanish had stolen from America and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during Prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, and all that.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, and the wide boulevards were lined with cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
The bar at the Hotel Nacional will mix cocktails for you as you wish.
And the cult cars of the 1950s still run around in Havana today because the once-imported schigulis and fiat have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Mag Havana, especially its oldest part, has fallen so much, nowhere else in the vicinity are so many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are being cleaned up, like Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last 15 years, not only in Havana have new hotels been built, but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba has another marathon that is unique in the world and attracts railway enthusiasts.
Sugarcane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauge railways to the sugar mills.
Their fleet has been unrefurbished for decades, and you can see clean, fully functioning locomotives whose peers have long been in museums elsewhere.
Destinations for excursions
The most important places are not excluded by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
It is only worth mentioning that there is a museum in the estate of Hemingway, which should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, and in their caves there was a fertile soil, covered by dense growth even in weathered rocky areas.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
It may also be interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
The following is the list of countries:
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and sugar trade brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the ornamental beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has changed little for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that there was no road to connect the area to the rest of the country until the 1950s.
This isolation helped keep it out of sight.
Nothing was built there, but nothing was torn down, and everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon to visit Trinidad, it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as the beach of Playa Ancón or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark and where the music does not cease until morning.
Other, of a kind used for the manufacture of foodstuffs
This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
I am sure that this view will be influenced by the way we go there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo to Guantanamo must cross high and rugged mountains and through a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was inscribed by UNESCO on its World Heritage List because of its pristine nature.
The best chocolate is made there, the church displays the cross of Columbus (in fact, it was made about a hundred years after Columbus's voyages), and the hill where the former castle, the present-day Hotel El Castillo, stands, offers several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion that the descendants of slaves profess, all these things could be written on many pages.
But, as they say, it's better to see for yourself.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
The United States believes that the lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment is affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as they had hoped, but the representatives of the countries that have deployed units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, is calling for more activity for NATO units, Britain has given priority to strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is apparent, but military might can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the people to start developing their own economy and security", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The US military says the Afghan insurgents' activity has reached its highest level in five years.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand by even 60 percent.
NATO countries have deployed some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
The United States has said that the Allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are demanding more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We're going to have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the future and how we can achieve them", Gates said.
The European Parliament has also been asked to take a decision on the draft budget.
"I'm not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries involved have also been in dispute over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun described the German soldiers as lazy this week.
"Afghan non-sturiers exposed: the Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting", the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
The Czech Republic has a national debt of 84 000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to be 159.2 billion KON in debt this year.
However, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion at the beginning of December, thanks to the better development of public budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
But since June, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its statements on the government debt as of early October.
Each Czech is owed 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has been in debt for more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far it seems that we may not cross the one trillion-krone limit until 2009 due to the lower deficit for next year.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns", said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: "We could reach a trillion-plus figure by the end of 2009.
Exactly when, depends on the next household we don't know yet.
If the political situation changes and politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not take such a change for granted", he noted.
Growing Debt
The national debt is derived from the national government's debts and is primarily due to the accumulation of deficits in the national budget.
The public debt is financed by government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds of the European Investment Bank.
The national debt has now risen to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The state's foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose 13 percent from the first to the third quarter of the year, which is a lot given the economic situation.
Interestingly, the growth is particularly evident in the debt securities sector, where the growth is 20%.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes", Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the government debt management for 2007 show that the government planned to raise CZK 159.2 billion for this year.
However, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner at the beginning of December, thanks to the better development of the State budgetary policy.
This is mainly due to the government deficit, which is expected to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
The maximum amount of appropriations for the consolidation agency is CZK 13.3 billion, a reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debt securities for 43 billion and interest rates for the European Investment Bank of 1,8 billion.
For giving a teddy bear a name, she was brought to court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who was accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and deportation by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this matter began in September when the teacher asked her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy.
"The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", reports school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all, it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the bear's picture on it and the caption "My name is Mohammed".
The bear himself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is simple: the portrayal of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to bring her too close to religious belief, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", and he said it was just an "innocent mistake".
An opinion shared by many of the teacher's students, who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and as "one who never talks about religion in class".
It should be noted that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common surname in the UK, with 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the Prophet (often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of that first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without overcoming their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status", European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
In the context of the negotiations, the Commission has also called on the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the peace process is fully operational.
"No violence is expected in the near future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time", he added, indicating that there are clear tensions.
End of the mediation on 10 December
The troika's mediators, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian, could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was given a new mandate by the UN in August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia has been and remains a supporter of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution", said Bosan-Kharchenko.
The one-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration, Western countries consider EU-supervised independence the only solution with a future.
Pristina is prepared to declare them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade is seeking greater autonomy
"Unfortunately, no agreement was reached", said Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, at the Baden hotel where these 'last chance negotiations' were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However, he added that the Belgrade-proposed autonomy plan "is part of a past that has led to murder and deportation".
The 'domino effect'
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise was always to be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly concerned about a "domino effect" in a region still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible", he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely and exclusively by the Security Council, where their Russian ally has a veto.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the final say"
"Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia", said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations took two years.
They must end up as they started: in the Security Council".
In response to reporters, Fatmir Sejdiu said that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be "in agreement" with the Western countries.
Bush unlocked an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which he led Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them reach a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must stop its colonization efforts, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments to the "peace roadmap" agreed in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas would ultimately seek a peace treaty that would resolve all open issues without exception, including the central ones".
This designation covers the three major issues that have been the main focus of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the 1948 conflict in what is now the State of Israel.
Abbas, the US president, said he was speaking and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted "comprehensively and thoroughly" and that a settlement be reached on all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
Olmert, for his part, pledged to ensure that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations were conducted "directly and without interruption" and that he would endeavour to ensure that they could be concluded before the end of 2008.
Bush has set a deadline for the implementation of his "two-state vision", a Palestinian and an Israeli one, next to each other, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it received assurances in this sense from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a major turning point in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
The prosecutor's office says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As with any local news, official versions and rumors are at odds.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the investigation by the National Police Disciplinary Service (IGPN), a police car was driving on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
"He was not on duty, but he was on patrol, and he was driving 40 to 50 miles an hour without blue light", a police spokesman said.
A Kawasaki-branded green motorcycle, "unlicensed, not allowed for public road use" (see below), came running at "very high speed" driven by two helmetless youths.
"It hit the left side of the police car after it missed its front door from the right", one policeman continued.
The alcohol controls carried out on the passengers of the vehicle were very negative.
The condition of the car (wings with a curved coil, windshields split, bumper sticks torn) is evidence of the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary manslaughter and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in consultation with the Val-d`Oise Public Safety Directorate.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the Prosecutor's Office said that it excluded the responsibility of the police to investigate the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police's version, namely that this small force betrayal has arrived relatively quickly on their left side".
Yesterday, a kind of crevice, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the floor, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, a rumor spread in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly without helping the two young people.
Although IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out 'any serious errors' in this matter.
According to a police source, "this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation and which must be carried out with great care".
Libération met an eyewitness in these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
"We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her", says this witness.
There was nothing to do".
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who was lazy.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth called.
In view of the rapidly developing tension surrounding the incident and apparently the certainty of the people present about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in by colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
Still, according to this witness statement, rescue workers arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also used heart massages, but to no avail.
"I will not allow any claim to be made that the police did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Every effort was made to try to save her, the prosecutor said.
Tension in Pakistan is rising
On Monday, Pakistani police blocked the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
Witnesses say that in the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades used by law enforcement.
Then they threw stones at the police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily detained.
Similar scenarios have been seen in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them were temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court prosecutors called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations were held in Multan (central) and Peshawar (northeast).
The law movement received support from the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance on Monday, whose president "called on the people to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
"Musharraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He was required to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on October 6.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
"All that we stand for is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court", the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give up the command of the army and become a civilian president "no longer applies" since the state of emergency was called, Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed to January.
The Pakistani government also denied the persistent rumors that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of women aged 20 to 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless made it possible to improve 'fertility control'.
Eight out of every ten births are carefully planned these days.
One in five couples even calculates exactly the month, and, if possible, the spring, the time of year when it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew will have spent more than seven hours in space performing the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has set several records due to its length, the distance of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools the astronauts "made" to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to be used by European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton solar module that was already on the ISS to get it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the restructuring of the module's solar panels, which have a span of 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be seen like accordions, was damaged by a cable that was stuck on a length of about a meter.
The restructuring was stopped so as not to damage the collector further.
The astronauts, who had originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a control tour and were then to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was flawed, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the 30-meter long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that was mounted at the station to perform the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
Big, tough, very smart, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore chosen to "operate" the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed a sort of rail at the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed close to the lock, and, from the inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped in insulation to prevent an electrical shock to the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had been devised and "configured" by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to begin their return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS is sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aerospace and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to counter the remaining A400M, EADS shares are currently showing a significant decline on the Paris stock exchange.
Currently, EADS is losing 4% on the Paris stock exchange at EUR 21.96.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again, referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to 'between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus', the European manufacturer's parent company EADS announced.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
The group also states that the new cost estimate is linked to the six-month lag.
It should be recalled that EADS's business performance declined by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, that of the very large A380 carrier.
The group had originally planned to deliver the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday, the vote count will not be exciting: the Russian masses will vote for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very well-balanced election campaign, it reaffirms its desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a message to voters that has already been recorded but is kept secret.
He is doing so as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is claiming an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, when the President received the foreign ambassadors, he did not let anything go unnoticed, and he was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
'We know the price of a true democracy and we hope for honest, transparent and open elections, elections without fraud,' he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, they have done so.
She's denouncing an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there "never had been such a dirty election, not even in the time of Yeltsin".
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unlawful demonstrations, according to his lawyer, and continues to be banned from visiting.
"The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus"
The European Parliament has been elected by the people of the Member States.
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to announce themselves.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, who will elect the government and the president?
Whatever it may be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
It's tradition.
"The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the masters of their destiny", says Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further: civil society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again attached himself to the model of a paternalistic state, which has been fully adopted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "freely renounce the personal responsibility" they have placed on the agenda shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"What do you think about?
This phenomenon affects all sections of society, including business.
And the administrative elite is good at keeping the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electorates of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, like in the '90s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
The conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "What is the longest thought?
Those in power aren't so bad, why replace them?"
A hard memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents in the archive, which are located in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, have so far been unable to be viewed unless they are "humanitarian", i.e. individually and in name, at the request of a former victim or his family.
The 11 governments responsible for administering the programme - including Germany, France, Israel and the USA - agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process for this Decision has been completed, the opening has been in force since yesterday.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will enable them to conduct research, "especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health of forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, head of the archive, which is managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians who had been deported or forced to work and, if necessary, to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
"Nothing fundamental can be expected from these documents", said Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, the trade between India and Europe is already at 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
"A free trade pact will give the two economies a huge boost" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans", Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued.The Asian and European giants trade 'goods worth €47 billion' and 'services worth €10 billion' annually, as Daniéle Smadja, the European Commission's chairman of the delegation in New Delhi, had said this week, and regretted that mutual trade had not yet "exhausted its potential".
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals.
The Bank of England has acknowledged the concern and offered £10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about curbing the current recurring concern about credit conditions, announcing a £10 billion offer with a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an unusual offer with an unusual maturity.
To mitigate fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about how to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the recovery phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks.
The Bank further explains that this will result in the circulation of 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) at 12.15 GMT on 6 December, at the rate of property tax, and only until 10 January.
This appears to be the first time the BoE has been able to circulate liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually takes place for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is 'prepared to take further measures to obtain the 'day-to-day interest rates' of interbank loans with their basic interest rate.
The daily interest rate variation between banks was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has fluctuated to 6.6%, slightly higher than on 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums in circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties that prevented banks from using them.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to sign the amounts circulated by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was produced in the context of a socialist "niche" (a meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), indicated about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, the majority of which were 50% for employment allowance, reintroduction of the TIPP floating, transport checks or rent restrictions.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some violent exchange of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present all their proposals as an amendment to the draft law on the adjustment of finances, which was examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors of the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer is cancelling the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"It is an honor for our company to work with someone who has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America", Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 is hosting the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival will probably take place from August 8th to 10th on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festival producers.
In 1989 he took over the running of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people a year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he's ever been to, says his company and Melvin Benn's are working side by side to offer the area a European-style festival event.
"We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
We have been negotiating with the city and the Commission has been motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been caught up in political debates about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss this with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the people".
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago after it made its debut in the festival world in 2002 alongside the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events were able to generate $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenue in 2007 respectively.
These two festivals are held in urban settings.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to be held in urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to combine these two concepts in one way or another, to convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is happy to take on the burden of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and to host a festival that will hopefully have a long life".
Charlie Jones says the festival's recording capacity is "very large", with about 80,000 people attending the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing has been confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators", says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the top Independent Promoter Award from the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is meeting the Terminator.
It's not easy getting the main Hollywood film platform to Montreal when no one less than the Terminator is against it.
These tricks are part of the delegate's job.
A politically difficult mandate because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is denouncing Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that are considered the best", he says.
The run to the festivals.
But for Denis Turcotte, the promotion of cinema is the top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At every festival on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, or Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, it's going to be about showing the Quebec movies, evaluating them, and making sure the producers are interviewing.
The Dark Ages had a successful showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's going to be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock market on the verge of a year-end rally?
With just under five weeks until the year-end, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the upcoming end-of-year rally.
However, experts cannot make reliable predictions.
Banif believes that "on a purely statistical basis, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development.
However, it is not advisable to make short-term forecasts and only on the basis of statistics, especially if the current market trends are determined by serious tensions.
Although other experts do not approve of such a sharp rise in prices in the last weeks of the year, they note that 'the exchange rate is determined by the liquidity of the market and the market participants, who invest mainly in pension funds, which are heavily affected by the upward trend in assets to be acquired due to the lack of secure equity funds.
According to these experts, the stock market will therefore be more likely to show a more lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, "especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent to which the US central bank's interest rate may fall, an uncertainty primarily due to rising oil prices and the risk of rising inflation rates".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
"The chances are not very good", assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on 8 November, at 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional pension fund subsidy that is made every year around this time.
However, the expert points out that things could change slightly this year, especially as a result of the end-of-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus immediately after the bridge day to the Constitution Day.
The analyst considered that price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, estimates that the market assessments so far are at a near technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which may depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis, in the near future.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of values to drive Ibex to new highs.
Solana of Intermoney says that "this year the big numbers are coming".
The expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies as the value gains, "because the electricity sector will be too expensive at some point".
In the meantime, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
"The ACS has been on a downward trend in recent months and we hope other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit", the expert said.
In terms of increased consumption during the Christmas period, periodic consumption will determine market trends in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also generate positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only seen two declines in coursework.
When the technology bubble burst in late 2003, it brought the stock market out of its crisis and launched the last real end-of-year rally to date.
This year, when Ibex 35 surged 28.17 percentage points, December saw a 6.68% price increase.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive year of profitability (Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will also be able to show a year-end rally will be seen.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically active regions of Spain.
For the institution operating under the Popular Max brand name, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to take the leap forward to extend the opening hours of its branches to 8.30pm on weekdays and to start on Saturdays from 10.00pm to 8.30pm.
BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening times in its branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the unions seem to aim at an agreement where 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for customers.
Whether more banks will join the new initiative, which will adapt to the opening times, will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And that's exactly the intent that Popular is pursuing with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores which, due to their location, can accommodate the shopping needs of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the 200 new branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening times.
The Bank will therefore restructure the premises of those branches already located in business zones and adapt them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of opening hours is thus linked to a new design of the premises, characterised by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The Bank's representative, Ángel Rivera, assures that the restructuring does not require any major investment, but would involve an increase in staffing, as a branch now needed eight or nine employees instead of six.
The subsidiaries, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía were chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 branches.
And 60 more, operating under the name Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax branches, the BBVA model is not used as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
"We do not want to be a competitor to our customers", explains Rivero.
They have provisionally agreed with Telefonica to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco has for the first time doubled its market value, thus outperforming its rival, Antena 3.
"We did it.
With this phrase, Telecinco's managing director, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange, as the channel he led had doubled its value to that of its rival, Antena 3.
But one aspect dampened his joy: "That's exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses", he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market they had not fallen too low.
Telecinco finished the day with a 2.54 percent increase yesterday.
This profit reduces its losses so far this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company now stands at EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has since January reported a total loss of 40.5%, bringing its market value to 2.193.46 million by half.
The market value of other publicly traded communications companies, on the other hand, is increasing: Sogecable's market value is 3.571 million, Prisa's (publisher of Cinco Días) market value is 2.518,53 million and Vocento's market value is 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be inferred from the fact that they are "two similar companies", according to Vasile.
The question remains to what extent we can actually act on the stock market, at what price and how we can make it profitable at the customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago that it plans to become the first television channel to generate more than 1 billion gross revenues from advertising this year, as Guiseppe Tringali, managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company, assured.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965,4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net revenues from television business increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco's comparatively better market performance is seen by analysts in the high payout ratio that the company has had to date: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of the 33% stake in Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
"We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have always stated much more.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we've already been able to increase by buying 33% of Endemol's shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers has only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
It also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4,5% for 2008 and 7,5% for 2009.
Three options.
1. the number of employees
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective returns and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (purchase) is more favourable to the market than Antena 3 (hold) because of the 'multiple incentives' and the booming market.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
JPMorgan: recommends that expectations in both cases be postponed in view of the "similar threats" (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress approves the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary draft, which closed its session today with the Congressional resolution in the Senate on the amendments to the project, the Government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of the Members of the Congress and the Senate, who in their negotiations and voting had sought to establish the best possible regulation to ensure investor safety and regulate individual business activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising financial markets, MIFID, which re-establishes the rules on securities services, aims to improve investor protection, increase the control requirements of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advice to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and also helps to set up new financial services firms (ESIS), advisory firms that partner with investment and securities brokerage firms.
It also extends the number of financial transaction systems, thus adding to regulated circulating markets the multilateral systems of effect trading and the systems of internationalization of trading orders, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law requires investment firms to disclose the priorities of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of risk management on the market and to register all the operations carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control function.
The Congressional Economic Commission subsequently considered further changes, with the decision that securities debt must now be considered as 'complex' financial assets due to its high risk level for the investor confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
The Commission also took advantage of the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the work areas of graduate economists, which was adopted 30 years after the Regulation restricting the work areas reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
The Senate, for its part, set out new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic intermediary who works on a foreign account, does not require authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialise products and to attract customers simultaneously to several investment firms.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose by five-tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare location and quality with US products by publishing data.
The forecast for the indicator can be made in advance by using the same approach as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but also using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator established in advance was only a benchmark and therefore did not have to be consistent with the final result to be announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the rise in the November VPI was a 'temporary development' and he assured that the price index would remain at a 'relatively high' level in the coming months.
However, Solbes noted in the halls of the congress that "even if the current figures are not good", Spain's inflation gap with other members of the monetary union has remained "more or less the same" in recent years.
He also said that there were "less surprises" in November than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%", the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin is forecasting revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's holdings have fallen by more than half since the bank asked the UK Central Bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year due to the crisis, and are now only £12 000 million (equivalent to €16 800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets were a record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen significantly in the last two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and will continue to fall despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would continue the group under the Virgin Money brand after the acquisition, will have to contribute about a quarter of the UK banks' income from the next three years' investment there to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds still needed to reach their target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to spend £50,000 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, which has three other companies involved, as its preferred bidder to drive it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of participating in urban corruption
Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) in Murcia this morning on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the local council and the head of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo was the deputy of Juan Morales, who was the deputy of the Popular Party and then the president of the city council of Totana, and may have been the original mastermind of the plot, according to Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the municipal and city planning departments' business records and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was charged with being the prime suspect in the case of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the "popular" and consequently privileged MP, Juan Morales, was arrested while leaving his client's residence on the basis of important, burdensome documents related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on Morales' alleged payments to a Galician construction company for the conclusion of an urban development contract which decided on the construction of 200 hectares.
There are currently eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of a victory, the Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a Socialist victory, to take over the office of President of the Congress.
This was announced by José Blanco, the PSOE's organizing secretary, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place at the party's headquarters today.
The Prime Minister said the offer to the former minister was justified because in politics "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, the Mancha politician would "all appear" to be running for the party's congressional chairman in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections.
Bono will replace Manuel Martín as President of the Congress, who announced on 15 November that he would not run for re-election at the next general election, that he would end his career in public policy and instead turn to the university environment.
The former minister had to admit that the prime minister had been continuously pushing for his return to politics since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that the party, as in the election of the Vice President for Economic Affairs, did not want to deny citizens who would take over the post of President of the Congress in the event of an election, calling it an 'act of transparency'.
If he were to take office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a "house of respect, not insult or scream", to make it "more and more similar to the citizens".
"Unfortunately, from time to time, the only place in Madrid where you can't speak quietly is the Congress, and the president of the government has been interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times".
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his "good work" and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call it "arrogance".
Climate policy
As the climate debate is being fiercely criticized by both climate change skeptics and those who are leading a social and political debate on it, the movement as a whole must show strong solidarity.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal, however, leaves him in need of explanation as to whether or not his government acted, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain's position within the EU as the country with the least compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the failure to meet the requirements, which sectors are responsible for this, and why his government, which proposed the "Treaty with the Planet", has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now obliged to present to the Spanish people his plans to combat climate change without delay.
The Commission has also decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the implementation of the programme.
Specifically, who will have to sacrifice and pay to save the planet.
However, there is no such explanation and there will be no such explanation in the future.
It's just about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be put in place to combat climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so strategically dangerous from the electoral point of view that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, the planet must now be saved with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty words without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his treaties with the planet, the politician who is otherwise suited to campaigning for election must neither speak, accuse nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding task of embellishing the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will be the only means of transport in the future or if we can only refresh ourselves with a subject.
The mayor and police chief of Totana for alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" politician José Martínez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor for allegedly committing urban violations, it said today.
The city councilman was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office, and in the premises where he has remained until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal building department "Suelo Industrial y Vivienda".
The three arrests were made in connection with searches in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid on Monday that revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped construction land for urban development projects should be redeveloped under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4,000 homes on the property after receiving illegal commissions from the local administration during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested but were subject to an investigation initiated and conducted by the First Totonas Tribunal.
The first six people arrested have been brought before the judge today.
According to the investigation, the investigation is also under way against the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP MP, Juan Morales.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, are also under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., whose company was a subsidiary of Nuaria and is said to have received the bribe.
The investigation is being carried out by the Municipal Urban Planning Authority, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven other searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly linked to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who is believed to have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia area, which would include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of redevelopment area in Totana, with the aim of building a project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, which is limited to the direct marketing sector, and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1. the number of employees
If you agree, we will move away from the term "Book of the Month" and try to invent a prize name for another name with the corresponding competence.
I already have a suggestion.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to make your suggestions.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
Our Finnish correspondent explains to us a commentary published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is at the top of the PISA study, by the way), which refers to the commentary published in the same newspaper on 18 November, coincidentally on the day of the publication of which the criticism of Blackburns' book was published.
"The content of the philosophy subject has become a topic of public debate after the tragedy at Jokela School.
The responsible for the brutal murders is a high school graduate who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, urged teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested removing Plato's teaching from the secondary curricula for philosophy in secondary schools.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, punishable by six months in prison.
However, if you rob a music business for less than EUR 400, this is only a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob a business up to a value of 1000 euros, theft is considered a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than it is to share music data.
Participation in a rebel conflict carries a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while data exchange carries a prison sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Penal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The sale of copyrighted films without authorisation by the authors is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague was right, someone has really upgraded his demands.
Fourth.
My GP handed me one of his long, strange research papers entitled "Money activates certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it".
So the feelings that come from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was carried out using a magnetic-to-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the latest edition of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn-based Life&Brain Brain Research Center, "the activation was greatest when the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed".
The researchers found that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right in their answer and received the same salary, but when one of them received twice that, there was also a higher level of brain activity".
I am not sure if it really takes so much scientific effort to reach such a result.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been searching relentlessly for the perpetrators of the Balkan wars for eight years and is based in the prosecutor's office of the former Yugoslavia's criminal court in La Haya.
Her term will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her post with a tearful and laughable eye as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims - the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serb Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
Their names are on a list compiled by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film "La Lista de Carla" (2006, not yet released in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York as she tries to track down the escaped criminals and pressure the respective governments to tighten their networks.
What insurance is best for me?
The car insurance covering any damage caused by the driver is a high cost, which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the licence, family status, type of car to be insured and use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right model.
First of all, you have to understand what we're dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insured person.
This agreement shall be concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company shall receive the insurance premium agreed and shall in return provide the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance policy composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also payable in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both women and people over 25 have to pay less, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they are less likely to have accidents than single persons, according to statistical data and according to the firm's belief.
The benefit attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage is.
In determining the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation carefully in order to choose the exact car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We will now list the most important points to consider when choosing insurance to make a choice not only in terms of performance but also in terms of price.
Under 25s face many obstacles when choosing a low-cost insurance policy, such as low driving experience and a 'young' driving licence.
Even if it is best to take out a full-cost insurance policy for ideal insurance coverage, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The prudent drivers can choose a full-cost insurance with self-employment, so that the benefits of full-cost insurance are covered but at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer having to pay part of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
"The amount is fixed before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid", explains Luis Noguera, Spain's chief representative at First Europa, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is extended insurance, which provides insurance against external accidental damage but not against damage to the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
I'll give you some advice.
If you are under 25, it is up to you to reduce insurance costs, so your credit will increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariffs.
The amount of loans and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments", explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract, because the accident rate is decreasing as driving practice increases.
It is therefore most appropriate to opt for a full-income insurance policy with self-interest.
"Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, either in the event of an accident or at the time of driving", explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of training after the 'beginner's fear' has been removed.
However, it is more appropriate for a married customer who has no children to take out full-cost insurance, of course only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
The insurers consider that couples with children are the customers with the lowest accident rate and their contributions are also low.
In this case, a full-cost insurance policy with a self-interest rate of around EUR 300 would be the best option.
"They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher contribution", notes Luis Noguera.
It is possible for pensioners to take out a full-cost insurance with a self-interest (about EUR 150) or an extended insurance which is only used if the credit is sufficiently high.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require careful selection to suit our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow are hoping to reach the semi-finals in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting in San Siro on Tuesday for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the Champions League final.
The Italian side already has five points and has already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow need another nine points to ensure that FC Shakhtar does not overtake Befica Lisbon by four points with six points.
The two Group D matches will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will compete for their first semi-final entry on the 13th, which will take place on the 16th.
The Italian side will not want to speculate at home, as Celtic Glasgow knows that if they win, they will be group first and thus have a better starting position in the eighth.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even lose to Shakhtar in a draw to qualify, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because the Ukrainians are tied at nine points, who lost 2-1 in Glasgow last week but were able to win 2-0.
The Milanese will therefore try to miss the Scots, who in turn hope to reach the eighth final of the re-formed Champions League for the second time in a row after being defeated in the same round by Kaka's goal in the play-off period (1-0) and a 0-0 draw in the second leg.
While FC Shakhtar await the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the final eight and their UEFA membership depend on their victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
The European Union has also been able to support the European Union's efforts to achieve a European Union-wide integration strategy.
20,000 people are attending the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls opened their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, before 20,000 spectators in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated just before the start of their concert at GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the mood in the reunited band was "excellent".
Around 20,000 people were able to watch the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video of the band's history was shown, which had gained popularity in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", which is released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were wearing golden bracelets on stage, which were previously given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the days before.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star "has never seen our wardrobe once, and so I'm already very curious what he'll think of the performance".
"Sporty Spice", who left the group in 1998 "due to internal disagreements" and two years later the group disbanded, expressed their nervousness at a press conference two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made this decision", Chisholm said of the breakup of the band that caused it nine years ago.
The singer also announced that "the disputes have been resolved and everyone is now very happy to see each other again".
Still, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
First, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines machine, according to a report by CTV.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of babysitters.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California, San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will take the stage in Madrid on 23 December.
New concerns about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
A new price dispute is raging between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian fuel exports to Western Europe being affected.
Most of Russia's natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be charged more because the group has agreed to pay up to 50% more for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine would have to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important guest states in talks", Ukraine's economy minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a drop in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up sharply.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas reserves with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must check foreign workers'
The Scottish public health service must improve the controls of the pre-trial registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation by Chief Financial Officer Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish public health service has no precise estimates of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were correctly performed on a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Officer examined personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a van was driven through the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out pre-employment checks on foreign workers to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Chief Auditor's report now states, among other recommendations, that the Board should adopt guidelines from the Criminal Records Exemption, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out", the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines to a high degree before hiring, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign healthcare workers is available".
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the current NHS Scotland pre-employment tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide", he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign staff, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely higher, partly because the boards had trouble identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The investigation further found that established control procedures were mostly followed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian.
This includes passports, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was concerned about doing this work in view of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport".
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices are reflected in the updated guidelines on control checks ahead of the recruitment of all staff, including those from abroad, which are scheduled for publication next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the film biography of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Picture.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast as Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded best lead actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - whose soundtrack features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was made for only £3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won two awards for the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for his cover of the iconic U2 album Joshua Tree - best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a Russian mob boss driver in David Cronenberg's thriller Easter Promises in London.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me", he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored".
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a panel of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it has arrested 208 militants for their membership in cells that planned an imminent attack on an oil facility and clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities after a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Home Office, says 18 of those arrested were in a cell run by a "missile expert" who had illegally entered the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the inmates were reportedly planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join Al Qaeda militias in Iraq fighting the allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is seen as heretical by hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias see many clergy in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the government-dominated royal family's policies.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to target the Saudi government in the West - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months", a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a 16-person "media cell" from Medina, which aimed to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could give us a glimpse of the future of the earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft shows that the planet resembles a distant twin of Earth even more than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation, and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a very different course.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the plants for a year, offer a sobering insight into how the earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar".
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario where Venus began billions of years ago as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment".
"Enriched Uranium" Seized by Police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars.
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he doesn't think a presidential candidate is worthy of being interviewed by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential nominee finally agreed to engage in a debate on YouTube where normal voters record and submit questions on video to send to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions and the answers, this time, mirrored exactly the state of the Republican Party, which is heading into the election next year.
It's not known, just like the producers at CNN who supported the debate, who chose the candidates to show YouTube clips.
However, during the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single subject, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a polling station when they heard something they liked: The television station noted spikes in approval when candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The most intense and long-lasting exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake up the reputation that he was a lenient immigrant when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
The two were particularly fiercely debated as questioners whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegal immigrants a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, succeeded in copying this issue.
Neither of the two men has a serious chance of being nominated, but both of them stay in the race, maybe because they've been on the immigration payroll sooner and harder than others.
At least in the immigration field, the candidates share broadly the same views: stricter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were brought up.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether to treat simulated drowning as torture.
One of the interviewers asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to argue that although the Bible was his favorite book, he might not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now in first place in a recent poll in Iowa against all expectations thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When pressed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said that Jesus was too intelligent to run for political office.
The race is unusually wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donation successes and his applause in Wednesday's debate.
These two are out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has been joining the party from the start and convincingly with a victorious message about the greatness of America and a twinkling of an eye on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this one's not particularly sleepy.
No noble title seems to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no foreign toes sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has been covering up donations to the UK's ruling Labour Party for more than 650,000 pounds over four years under the name of other people, and that the party failed to report it, is something that the rival Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When the Prime Minister withdrew the call for an election two months ago, foolishly insulting British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly shrewd Liberal Democrat chairman, put it, the Brown once feared by Stalin has evolved into Mr. Bean.
The unfortunate rescue of Northern Rock, a bank that was hit, showed weak regulatory and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have led business associations to oppose the government.
The tax authorities' loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the upper house protesting military spending cuts: they claimed to be minister of the armed forces, a part-time job.
Now there are the many different donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's secretary general (and its former executive director) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown is irrevocably retiring.
Yet governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
People may not trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it becomes clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service begins to leak; the cabinet ministers begin to chatter; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction files, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misfortune - like the long "nobility money" investigation into political party funding - voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely distracted.
And the countermeasure, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns' Stalinist tendencies of course always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation trend is a good example.
The garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be true, but he didn't have the choice.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement but didn't say it was illegal, will of course have to ask some questions, just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financial officer, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered that determination by seizing a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to the full measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lectures" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as find a permanent chairman of the Independent Standards Committee on Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to abandon the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party member like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can win is through undeniable integrity and solid competence.
Other fish
Is the credit crisis affecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's only natural that the spinal fluid swirls around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is in tatters, the predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded loans spreading to other forms of consumer credit spreads.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both borrowing and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either unsecured or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it had withdrawn $1.4 billion in fees from its US consumer financing, partly because of weak credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the Moody's rating agency, the third-quarter surge rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency law in 2005 led to a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large part of the credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would rise again whether or not general conditions for borrowers deteriorate.
The industry also reports solid repayment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay each month
And trust in credit card-based securities is pretty strong, despite the downturn in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research firm, expects that expenditure for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take credit card debt, now that home loans are draining.
However, card issuers look at cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates decrease when the property is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond to the more volatile conditions much faster and more flexibly than lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and completely reevaluate loans", says Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercutting crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit crunch push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimer future.
Keep looking for those shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron
Three British bankers who were due to face trial for their role in the fraudulent scheme with former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow changed their pleas to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of wire fraud for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been postponed to January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were identified in the UK during two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, her case marks the loose end of an investigation that began after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges initially filed against her in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers, known as the "NatWest Three", claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped drive the company into bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company controlled by Kopper acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely claimed to Enron that the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the 20 million dollars actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others were paid about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in the Louisiana State Penitentiary.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on parole on a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States awaiting trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks that prevented it from covering up its billions in debt or making weak businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion in market value, and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron crash.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died of heart disease last year.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $54 million.
But that's a small sum for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president".
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires Exhibition, a four-day showcase consumer orgy held in a nestled exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly-arrived Russians in everything from mahogany-plated yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully aimed a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's a small sum compared to us", he said.
"Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft after the United States".
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas in its heyday.
"We went through the same period in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in crowds to Europe, where they were seen as materialistic", said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi Arabian airlines of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's most visible free-floating money issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow, this week a conference of the luxury industry drew Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, with a total of $282 billion, according to Forbes' list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a combined $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert group here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all well-groomed and men are all worth a fortune".
As they walk through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday nights, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the newly rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian shoppers who would be willing to stand for hours in traffic to visit a high-end warehouse that shamelessly placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears side by side.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically sitting at a porcelain stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a hand-painted blue mosaic image of Rembrandt.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbing climbers".
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (which is 10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from big-ticket logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers that wouldn't be marketed at a trade show.
Yet thousands of people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that supplies high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car company that tailored to customer demand, said he'd sold three cooling grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that look like chain-linked tires for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spikes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-piece.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to have a cubic zirconium leather wheel or a picture of his wife's face will not necessarily ride on these wheels", said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his garage of 30 or 40 cars".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company had set up four British-style red cell phones that were packed with tons of fake millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake notes for the millionaire's fair.
Passersby would stop to throw around the heaps of money, take cell phone photos while they sat back in the middle of the exchange, get picked up by friends, or just get a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", said Mr. Karryev.
Suspected forgery in New Jersey .
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, a police car came.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's boxcar approach", said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died".
The hearing learned that the deceased, Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they are hopeful that tox screenings, whose results may not be available for weeks, will help unravel a mysterious death that sent a message of mourning to the Newark Police Department.
Ms. Arroyo was an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and persistent", Mr McCarthy said of Mrs Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me".
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York City police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would be trying to determine if Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities", said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation".
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead on the scene.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have given little information about their investigation or the owner of the house, listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh wouldn't say if Mrs. Castro was being questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a weakened rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes were hooked on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable, helping him adjust to the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to watch this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing".
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to a rise in world stock markets
Shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the central bank would try to calm credit markets by further rate cuts were bolstered by alarming comments from the vice chairman of the US central bank.
Stock markets in London, New York and across Europe rose after Donald Kahn, the number two of Ben Bernanke, the central bank's chairman, said that policies had to be "flexible and pragmatic" to respond to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm volatile markets in the face of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market performance from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence continues, it would increase the possibility of further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The comments also helped calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that US real estate sales reached new record lows in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were highlighted by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage lending sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of British stocks.
The German index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
The re-emergence of credit pressure on markets had previously been highlighted after strong demand for a three-month European Central Bank guarantee auction granted to the European Commercial Banks was increased by a considerable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and to feed more capital into the London money markets increased as credit stresses rose to their highest level since late September, following a continuous increase since 21 November, when the three-month LIBOR rate for lending between UK banks rose to 6.59%.
England faced with a decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be the number six for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electorate chairman, at least under this particular title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English chief executive, is gradually filling with applications for national electorates, if not even part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sports are undoubtedly.
It is never easy to pinpoint exactly what makes a person at the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
It's not just cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is this the right time for Bopara to go up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question may be asked in another area, such as whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or drown?
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but so do chances.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batsman must get regular chances on order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, say, James Anderson, who is apparently going to play in the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison is self-proclaimed healthy and the wind is blowing in the net.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each to earn a place on this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, taking five wickets and scoring 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough into a major Test cricketer and who, although he scored a double century against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underrated.
It is likely that after further discussion during today's networking session at Asgiriya Stadium, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Shah is talking about his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class centuries and only six from Bopara, who is 22 years seven years younger, and an excellent balance against a round of balls.
But Shah scored just ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Lord's Test, his home ground as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take his position for the next game, seems to have taken the impetus from his strike, which was still evident in Bombay.
On the contrary, the all-powerful man from Essex is a man of great joy.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was brought to a point when he had recently overtaken a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (of course, also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had been watching this from a distance, and say enthusiastically, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better pitcher, he's been bouncing his midfield pace with some effect here on the pitches, which seems to suit him and he's beating with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not be doing well, if, as the tea bag from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's playing here this weekend.
Buses take refugees back to work and fight al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas had run out, and others hoping the city would return to normal.
Some even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before 800 people from Damascus arrived in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was in operation with refugees from Syria and Jordan returning on private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad", said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now".
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to withdraw at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow him to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the US had helped drive Al Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, by a hand grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they were starting an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That is why I came back today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local "affected citizen groups" armed and working with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more people spoke of being forced home by visa problems and a lack of funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government pressured the Iraqis to stop issuing visas to force them to return to Iraq", said the Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left".
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, which has led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and create conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest German state is a leader in vocational education and even has a great international orientation.
In one field of education alone, the Saarland is in the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saarland that we are not French" - this slogan is self-ironically posted by the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is ranked fifth in the Cologne Institute of the German Economy (IW) education monitor.
The European Union has a long tradition of cooperating closely with its neighbours.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But rural children also bring the Saarland to higher education in higher numbers than the average - many of them without a high school diploma.
"The Saarland vocational education system is used", says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their education at a vocational school, making Saarland more than seven percentage points higher than the federal average.
The combined possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively wide.
In terms of population, dual degree programmes are the second best in Germany.
However, despite the close training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"We have started several reforms in the education system after the first Pisa study", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
To help children start learning early, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now being copied by other federal states.
The results of the studies will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of at-risk students fell from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not rise as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And to the dismay of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could score points.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez is turning the clocks around.
In Venezuela, the clock ticks differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will have the timepiece in the South American country turned back half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez is becoming a joke.
According to the official newspaper of Venezuela, a new law sets the clocks to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that no other country in the world has.
The US-enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed the division of time zones on the world in full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the severance of relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not have relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this on my own because of my dignity", said Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reforms that the citizens of Olland will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Urib's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe "spit in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, Chávez had criticised on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is in the public eye.
A new phone ringing is spreading in the country: "Por qué no te callas" is the phrase that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
It was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at the recent Ibero-American summit was annoyed by the constant intermittent calls of the left-wing populist and had been over his mouth.
German threatens 2007 wage decline
Despite the strong economic situation, it is forecast that German workers will lose real wages this year.
Experts have given a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employees could expect less on the payroll than in the previous year.
"It is the modest wage growth, the increase in VAT and the price cuts in food and energy", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the Bild newspaper.
The new burden on workers could also be placed on unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was, in the current situation, correct and reasonable.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the explosion in food and mineral oil prices had driven inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Prices increased by 3.0% year-on-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is thought to be more similar to Earth than it has been before: the European spacecraft Venus Express has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind gusts at the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that there is a flash on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has shown that it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus is shooting at a height of about 35 miles [56 km] from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the science journal Nature.
According to the famous "soup theory", lightning caused life on earth: storms are said to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the Devil's twin of the Earth, but she is a twin", said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has taken such a completely different course is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as no spacecraft has been on the road to explore this planet since the early 1990s.
The researchers believe that the latest research, now presented in several Nature articles, not only highlights the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that our neighboring planet has more in common with Earth than was originally thought", says the ESA.
In addition to the already known North Pole wind, the researchers also found a cloud-shaped swirl at the South Pole, which is turning much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the earth's winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-largest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost as large as Earth, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also called the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it rotates much more slowly around itself: a day on Venus takes 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
On both of them, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is fixed in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Koehler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for their attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the Grand Coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue", Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universal to me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures", said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain a delicate balance in its foreign policy, the German president stressed, but Merkel took refuge in the accusation that she was pursuing a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too", said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked from the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, there was a sharp irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only discharged German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to SPIEGEL, has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refuses to accept the official Tibetan religious leader as a European politician, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed China's position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against crabs as in France
Street fighting with the police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against crawl like in France.
The German Minister for the Interior called for all efforts to ensure that social discontent in Germany did not escalate into violence on the streets.
Barricades were burning, gunmen fired shrapnel at the police: following the heavy youth clashes in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development.
"We must ensure that social explosives do not build up and discharge into violence.
We must take this seriously", he told the New Press in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The Federal, state and local authorities have already been working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about integrating migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have already been achieved".
It is too early to warn, however.
Schäuble also pointed out that urban and sociological problems in German suburbs are not as common as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had been in heavy street fighting with the police in the past few nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were burned.
The German government has called for greater integration efforts, however, by Kenan Kolat, the chairman of the Turkish Community in Germany.
In the face of the French riots, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as dire as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 was "over average high".
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the marketing of certain products.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of the Internet has been adopted.
The chairman of the Turkish community, however, added that "social control of families takes place more in Germany than in France".
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat warned: "But we must be careful anyway".
The aim is to "give young people the opportunity to participate in work and education quickly".
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel was largely quiet.
Hundreds of police were on duty, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The authorities have reported three arrests and a couple of burning garbage cans and cars.
Since yesterday, a recall of about 1,000 security forces has brought peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were wounded in a crawling accident in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots swept through Toulouse.
The crawls were ignited in a traffic accident that killed two teenagers on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Cloud
The Chancellor's distant appearance documents the fact that the coalition is essentially over - and that nothing more can be expected of her.
What country does this chancellor actually live in?
After her discouraged appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was bitter and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy with a sharply overstated phrase.
It was provincial, she said, and she showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has made clear to everyone how true her accusation is.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke introduced herself: a disloyal politician who fled to foreign policy and even there remained in disarray.
For example, climate protection: she has been unabated in her praise of the decisions taken by Saint-Dam, but she has not said how to achieve climate goals in this country.
I think that the Commission should be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are adequately used.
Now she's clinging to the flap that the boost will come to people.
It damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But in Angela Cloud's realm, domestic issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low-income?
She's got a few extra things left.
It's a remarkable number of times she makes promises when it comes to child abuse.
It takes three steps for Merkel to come up with a half-way straight line.
She stumbles like a stranger when it comes to reality.
Attack department
In the Republican presidential debate on YouTube, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are getting a hard-fought fight - and now they have to fear an outside candidate.
The candidates' excitement is unleashed on the first issue.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He, for his part, responded with heavy accusations: "I would say his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants", and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of privately employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are blowing their attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second videos that people uploaded to YouTube are hardly more than a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power", accuses John McCain of his opponent Ron Paul, the only one in the race to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also getting the Levites read out loud by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning as torture.
However, the main themes of the campaign are now beyond the Iraq war and torture debates, as the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show.
When conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected, applause burns in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the two favourites' weaknesses lie.
"I was wrong", Romney explains crushedly, begging the public and the media to know that he was still an abortionist in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is alarmed when asked what he thinks is the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civil for the first time
One day after he resigned as army chief, the ruling Pakistan leader, Musharraf, was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidants Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus succumbed to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling as a civilian head of state for the first time.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after taking the oath, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, fulfilling another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which had seized Musharraf after the state of emergency was imposed in early November with his weighted jurists, had dismissed all objections last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Herb Dress Return
Germany's supergroup of the 1970s is back on the music scene: The three Harmonia band members played their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a cut from their big time appears "Live 1974".
They were already much more famous abroad.
The sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables, and most of all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, in a bloody white shirt, is 63 years old in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves his eyes, concentrating on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally fits into a traditional piece of music.
It seems that the gentlemen themselves are not too disturbed.
The band's return to music has caused some excitement among herbal rock fans.
And here's what we can reveal: Targeted surveys have shown that while the name has been roaring through the collective pop memory, it's not sustainable enough to miss this band for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German celebrate his living legend from the 1970s?
Especially when what is misleadingly called herbal rock has always been more popular in England and America than in our own country.
When the music industry awarded the Cologne group Can 2003's survivor the Echo Prize for lifetime achievement, they saw German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the wonder knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later stood on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old pal.
The problem of ignorance at home and transformation abroad is one thing.
The memory is overwhelmed by harmony because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a far less force of action than was assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a record label maintained by the Church.
Rother had briefly helped with the power plant and then made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Rother, however, followed the cluster musicians into exile in the Weserberg lands around 1973.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city fugitives.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to molest herself as a child.
I'm more of a skilled artist.
The garbage contained a wimpel of the Harmonia Ottenstein vocal group and a name for the art.
Some things kept Harmonia from it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the next was "De Luxe".
Because the music sounded so calm and humble, the band was in need of material things.
The gathering of rice was not only for self-discovery.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Greess, in front of a nearly 50-head recording set, as some may recall.
Rother had a desire to force harmony and occasionally practice it.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an immoral demand.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Sphere and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since become more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album by Griessmer is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Her record company Greenland has set itself the goal of promoting herbal rock as a distinct German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius' solowork.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British punk and author of the "Grassroots Sampler" handbook.
And then there's the man who invented Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of Krautrock influences on the next generation of pop music.
Harmonia is filling the supergroup gap.
Brian Eno's line floats with the strangest sounds in the room: "The only true music is yours, the future".
There are pictures showing the producer with harmonica in the farmhouse.
The legend formation is made up of projections of other black and white images of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are back in the improvisation business.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to induce unheard-of sounds to the instruments through self-made effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technical depths.
The choir of the house doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morningstar, the sound is hoisted and whispered and in a beautiful place, with emphasis on "Aaaaaaaah!"
I mean, weedrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about a rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in music schools (Can), technology (power plant) or the escape from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
If you call '68 here, you're not entirely wrong, and Harmonia can't be taken out of his mind right now.
Even the most obvious is thoroughly considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
It can be nerve-wracking or bring you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murder Peace", two more films deal with the Balkan War.
But neither of them convinces.
Either the concepts are too much action and payers, or they're too moving.
Richard Gere can't help with the Hunting Party.
The good news is that war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the dark interior of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere has been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s because too many nice, uninteresting roles in women's comedy films and too many Buddhist press conferences were making you want to watch.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the main argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes a Hunter" (why do movie titles have to be as long and confusing as taxi driver fare agreements nowadays?)
He gives a wonderful, eye-catching account: Basically, his war correspondent Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry hadn't been so gracious: a man who has long since had his finest days, but who, even as a monument to his decline, has preserved considerable remnants of the one charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" along with the German production of "Murder Peace", which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war movies.
With Murder Peace, the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from a Kosovo sniper, and the other quickly falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not here as the sole root of all evil, the television film is too quickly lost in the action and the glamour.
It's a Cobra 11 alarm, but it's not a highway, but it's a war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is a perfect example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "The Fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another screenwriter (both in the staff union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the woods to do something the military can't, and both times it's going to be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons why "The Hunting Party" failed is that you can't just let Simon Hunt be the down-on-his-luck cynic we've been introduced to at the beginning.
No, the script must also instigate a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party will finally be destroyed when the last five minutes of the time trial have allowed reporters to do what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters around the world have failed to do in five years: catch war criminals and let Muslim Bosnians get their revenge.
It's so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the kinologist.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects that the Americans and the French (who are to be exceptionally agreed) are not pursuing the persecution too intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the good and the bad are sometimes so similar that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
It says of the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I see the swollen eardrums with compassion, implying how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those headaches, but they indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war films.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq movies were Hollywood's big flops.
And you can add that there has never been a good South African film.
Almost always, when a star is walking around the world's crisis flocks or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "About All Boundaries" with Angelina Jolie, or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It took decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are likely to be mature - the Vietnamese classics of The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket were not universally celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today, when every mass murder comes to our homes on two screens in real time, we know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the screenwriters of the reliability it takes to tell good stories.
"His or His Not" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastically distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel, "Lemprières' Dictionary", and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change.
The great cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrible way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia".
Beust reaping criticism for the Olympics' cancellation
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism from the political and economic community.
Many want to keep fighting for the water games.
But Beust's advice is to be realistic when assessing the odds.
The general manager of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a waiver on Wednesday "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently unfolded in the city as much motivational force as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level".
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach to it "based on a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday remained on previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic competition, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbündnis expected in early December on an application from Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have envisaged until 2028".
Yet the dream was not forever dreamed out, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beust.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will not be seeking to compete in the Olympics for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to create a chance by burying the plans already at this time", HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
The refusal to apply also contradicts the statement made by the President of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Association.
In the letter, Mr Beust described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Association of Higher Education Sports had only nominated Hamburg as the candidate city last week.
The SPD citizens' group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put Olympia on the map and has excluded housing", said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Little Grassbrook has always called for integrated planning for the Olympics and later residential use, the CDU has unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
The bidding for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had sparked a lot of enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, had failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
If you combine the terms Sweden and wooden boxes, you're thinking of IKEA, but not Andy Warhol.
Or did he?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's worksheet.
Most of the 94 brillo boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo boxes a few months ago, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now yields a sobering result: The six "Brillo boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén left to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies - and probably most of the approximately one hundred other "Type Stockholm" Brillo boxes in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is entwined, a confusing intertwining of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York City, painted wooden boxes based on the red, blue, and white design of the "Brillo" soap powder cardboard boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - displayed hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
It was not a work of art, but a model of art, a mere exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few wooden brillo boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which were then authorized as original Andy Warhol briallo boxes, entitled "Stockholm type", and have rightly entered the history of art and auction.
Some of them have made over $100,000 at auctions.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that about a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three Swedish-owned brillo boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press pan with a paint roll without grounding - and it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's brillo boxes", says Moderna Museet Director Lars Nittve. "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York reaches a different conclusion, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copy/exhibition material".
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would comply with the "heavy charges" made in respect of the soap powder boxes.
But since then, they've been hiding in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila are giving up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had locked themselves in a hotel in Manila demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had given up.
He cannot answer for bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, to reporters at the hotel.
Government-loyal soldiers had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen or so soldiers had been locked in the building for hours.
About half of them were brought to trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly settle with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to guard him had apparently rushed to him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces surrounded the district around the prestigious hotel.
The President has convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough", Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, who was formerly in command of the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units were about to join the march.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was the scene of an attempted mutiny by about 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, the company said on Wednesday evening.
They now hold 20.05 percent of the equity.
There was previous speculation about a takeover.
The option of increasing the share of transatels is open.
The move aims to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, speculation had been raised about a move after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house only holds the shares for a third party, it said in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already taken a 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares of this stock for 31.4 million euros.
The companies also discussed marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", explained a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies have established the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a 10 percent stake in Freenet and not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 percent, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The months-long and still difficult to manage poker around Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-connection customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01% of Freenet shares.
Now it was agreed that Drillisch would bring in another around 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
