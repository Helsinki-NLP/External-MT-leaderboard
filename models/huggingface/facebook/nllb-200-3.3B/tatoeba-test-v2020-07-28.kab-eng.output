Do you like dogs?
Tom likes to travel.
No one answered.
Keep the oil out of the fire.
They got married.
After I finish eating, the first thing I do is brush my teeth.
He went as a sacrifice.
No one has ever asked Tom that question.
Please don't leave me here with Tom.
Israelis call it "Israel" in Hebrew.
Isn't Tom a fool?
Do you like playing football?
Please read it again.
You haven't paid any attention.
The house is rented.
It's a waste!
It was Belaid at Eli who founded Kabyle literature in writing.
I hope to return on October 20th.
Tom was having sex with Mary.
This article is useless.
Get yourself dressed.
Can you do that for us?
You two should leave.
She can speak Japanese.
I'm not your type.
They went to the zoo.
A man was stripped of his tongue.
There's nothing you can do to help.
The Kabyle language is rich!
Tom is outside, isn't he?
Stop worrying and get busy!
I don't know where Tom lives.
No one knows what tomorrow will bring.
Have you read it?
Tom's family persuaded him to stay.
I like to swim.
I know who lost first.
Where do you want to go?
The old Hebrew is easier than the old Hebrew.
Get your feet out of here!
It is increasingly clear that we have not opened a world.
They are birds.
I thought he would come.
Follow your dreams.
Tom is close.
Are you a witch?
Someone is trying to deceive you.
Someone tore two pages from this book.
They didn't tell me.
Are you from Tibet?
Tom is cooking dinner.
I should have fooled you!
He is.
Give me some time.
I forget his name.
Tom will leave for Australia on Monday.
Can you stop the noise?
The state is inhabited by the poor, and the poor depend on it.
He went out of the river.
I need a car of my own.
You should eat now.
Thank you for helping me every time.
How many books have you read?
Are you serious?
He is a coward.
You can't leave me like this.
No one died.
Something is missing.
Thank you for inviting me here.
Are you looking for someone?
Who is in charge?
Will she go?
You were wrong.
I drank a cup of coffee.
Are you writing a letter?
I cut my hair every month.
Tom needs me.
Let the dogs swim.
You can now consider Layla your daughter.
It's too much!
How many times?
Who else uses Tatoeba in your office?
Tom offered to help Mary.
I'm tired of your jokes.
Tom changed places.
Tom and I went to the wedding together.
I hope no one saw you doing this.
I want to visit Boston in the spring.
Make me a sandwich, would you?
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
Someone might want it.
Who is rich?
Shouldn't I be working tomorrow?
When did you return from Boston?
Are you all right?
Now that I'm older, I think about other things.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
I don't know what else to say.
Keep your head up!
I don't want to grow old.
I won't accept your mistakes again.
Spit it out.
How many books do you have?
You should learn from your mistakes.
Bring her to the house.
Do you watch TV every day?
How does your coffee taste?
You have a stain of spinach on your teeth.
I haven't seen him since then.
We're not going to stop.
I hope to return on October 20th.
I'm already tired.
I wonder where she is.
Tom never returned his money.
I always walk on foot.
Tell me something about it.
Please don't die.
Tom pretended not to have heard anything Mary had said about him.
I think we can help.
My dear fellow...
I hate it!
Tom stayed.
Someone stole it from me.
Did Tom really say that he thought he would stay in Australia?
If I were you, I'd go home and get a good rest.
Some of what you say is nonsense.
Tom and I went to the wedding together.
Did you believe the stories?
He will stay safe.
Did your religion come into being peacefully?
Aren't you people hungry?
Look at yourself.
Is there anyone who can help me?
Tom couldn't save Mary.
Tom lives with his mother in Australia.
There is a God.
You've obviously lost them all.
Tom lied.
Who will take his place?
You're better than Tom.
I have my own bag.
Tom and Mary are helping each other.
Give Tom his freedom!
Someone tried to kill you.
They all agreed.
I already told you that I didn't do it.
I was hit by a fall that I couldn't resist.
Are you a Catholic?
Don't worry about it.
The champagne is too cold.
Where are those boys?
The world is a small village.
Is there anything else?
You should ask someone else.
I hope no one saw us.
The trees are growing.
Sami is playing Farid's guitar.
How late will you be leaving?
I hope no one saw you like this.
I want to know more about your country.
I hate French.
Tom was fired in October.
I hope no one saw you.
You didn't tell me about it.
Tom answered in a deep voice.
Tom will be late again today.
The church has ten congregations.
Do you think Tom loves me?
You are a good man, Mother.
Do you like chickens?
Do you want to stay longer?
Has a cow ever calved?
Tom took the last remaining seat.
I'm going to take a picture.
Tom loves you.
I speak Old Greek.
Tom didn't tell the truth about where he was that day.
Tom is angry.
Hello, my dear.
There is no class on October 20.
Are you lying to me?
You expect too much from him.
You are getting married.
You're part of the problem.
Stop whining!
Sami was playing on Farid's lap.
Tom didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
Are you a native?
I hear something.
What's wrong with you?
Every sick person is healthy.
I was lucky to meet you here.
I was invited to sing a Chopin.
Go slowly.
I hope Tom is strong.
Stop worrying.
Did you see him?
Are you shy?
Dan bought a new computer.
Is there anyone else?
Tom doesn't know how to write on a computer.
My summer is October.
I was in the mountains.
Stephen is dead.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
Have you used them?
Please tell me your real name.
I hope no one followed you.
Is there anyone else?
I hope no one is watching you.
Tom was with Mary.
Let's go and tell the others.
What is this wine?
Please stay here.
I did nothing wrong.
Have you seen Tom yet?
He will be fine.
Follow the wheel.
You have a book to read.
Tom knows that I'm not afraid of anyone.
She is saying it.
Did anyone call you?
I didn't think it counted.
He took her home.
Everybody hated Tom.
Tom and Mary met at the station.
You obviously lost them all.
Can I rely on you?
Get in there!
I want you to go to your room and clean your beds.
Come and try something.
It's all right.
Stop worrying.
You are our prisoner.
They were worried about that.
Welcome home to you.
You've already waited here.
Are you working tonight?
Stay with me for a while.
Please let me pay.
Tom refused to answer.
I know that Tom is Canadian.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
Tom will turn thirty in October.
Jim looks like his father.
I need you here.
I think there's someone in the next room.
Do you know?
Are you crazy?
Tom will tell Mary.
Do you speak French?
Tom stopped kissing his wife.
No one knows.
Shut up!
None of Tom's advice is very useful.
You still have your life ahead of you.
They all ran away.
We traveled the country by car.
I am a Chinese woman.
Did Tom say anything about his accident?
Tom pointed a finger at Mary.
Are you sick?
I hope no one saw you come here.
Tom slept for only a few hours.
We will all be sorry.
Sami was talking to his mother.
I let Tom kiss me.
Sami found a pot in the barn.
Wait for him.
Tom said he wanted to get a cold.
Tom is waiting.
Someone is watching us.
I want to show you some translated texts for publication.
They keep talking.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
It is a secret.
The construction began in October.
I brought you something to eat.
Keep moving!
I was a little surprised to see Tom there.
They were slow.
Put that down!
They built it.
You should never forget this.
I can't stand to see her.
He collected them.
Tom thought Mary might have been brainwashed.
Tom seems to be indifferent to Mary.
Tell me again who will help us.
Tom stopped reading.
You should be careful of them.
Aren't you about the same height as Tom?
Sometimes, a nod of the head is just a sign that you are listening carefully.
Tom attended the party yesterday.
Ayako, lower your voice a little.
How deep is it?
Good luck to you!
I was in his room.
The fish are all mixed up.
I haven't been in Boston since October.
Someone forgot his umbrella.
Tom doesn't know how to speak in public.
Everybody is happy.
He left on Tuesday.
Thank you for listening.
Can you fix this?
Please be careful! The doors will be closed now!
Somebody has to stop you.
It's not a crime to cheat.
Omar is just a little bit shy.
Tom is poor.
There is no laughter left, if the teeth are not closed.
You are stinking.
The final round of the competition will be on October 20th.
You're better than me.
Tom said he knew how to speak French.
I'll do everything I can for you.
Swimming is good for your health.
I am a writer.
Tom didn't raise Mary.
Wash your clothes.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
I was on the road last summer.
Why doesn't anyone speak?
Eat something!
Did you see the movie or not?
I should probably go now.
Tom threw Mary's sunglasses out of the window.
Can I talk to you two in private?
Who is ready to ask?
I want to call my guitar.
Tom made me very angry.
We are starving here.
Sami will cry like a baby.
Tom and I love each other.
My best friend betrayed me.
We didn't ask Tom to help.
Your eyes are blinking.
Let me out!
How does that look to you?
Sami was reading aloud.
I took a nap.
She read to him.
You!
Hit it! hit it!
Tom is three feet taller than Mary.
Don't overindulge in food if you don't feel like eating.
Tom was angry with Mary.
Someone has stolen my money.
Aiko, wait a little longer.
Tom doesn't seem happy.
The computer is new.
You told him straight away.
The sick need the sick.
Tom never asked me.
Are you asleep?
When are we going to do it?
Tom should buy Mary a ticket, too.
You are crazy.
Is anyone here?
Can I go home now?
She is a woman, not a girl.
Sami told me that you were in the audience.
You will be happy.
I continued to work.
You shook them.
Someone is coming after us.
I moved here last October.
Will you go with me?
Tom wants to work.
Tom became Mary's friend while they were living in Boston.
You have no idea.
Tom is much younger than me.
I finally visited Boston last October.
We're running from Tom!
Please let me out.
Tom is not a Pokemon.
Someone called for you.
Hurry up!
This is the truth.
I forgot everything about you.
I love you very much.
I know these people.
Everything is fine in your area.
I want to walk with you.
Have you ever read this one?
Tom didn't think I would do that.
Tom and I went out together.
Are you all right?
Take this.
I'm not your friend.
I hate coffee.
She teaches English.
Do you think I can be seen?
Leave it to us.
He sent me a message.
Behave yourself!
It doesn't make any sense.
Ask the other one.
I won't let you pay.
I need to be alone to think.
Walk slowly like that.
Does Tom believe that?
She eats these things.
Someone is looking at you.
He is a Greek.
Tom is not expected to be here on the 20th of February.
You are all crazy.
Is there something bothering you?
Tom ate a whole bag of spaghetti.
Is Tom still crying?
I think that's not true.
Get out of here!
Ja'far is a monk.
They missed the train.
They are dead.
He danced.
This is my opinion, not yours.
They were armed.
A little silence, please!
Tom is anorexic.
The winter begins in October.
Go on then!
Tom was angry at Mary.
Go and change your clothes.
The mountain turned him into a stone!
Someone else has already done it.
Tom can't help.
Good luck with your new job.
He hates Algerian culture.
Come to the house.
What's the problem?
He is gone.
Is there anyone there?
Can you find her?
You can be a writer.
I saw you in my dreams.
Try it on.
Do not make mistakes.
Answer them.
Tom seems to be busy.
I learned that from you!
I still like Tom.
Get up !
I don't know how to answer your question.
I swore to Tom not to tell Mary.
He is blind.
Think about it.
There is strength in numbers.
Please do as I say.
You are part of the problem.
Are you crazy?
Whose is it?
You drank a cup of coffee.
Can you see?
How long have you been studying?
When did you first go to Australia?
Tom is teasing Ken.
Tom carefully removed the trunk.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
You stayed at home.
One more question.
Tom smiled.
I remember.
Tom loves to see Mary dance.
I'm out of money.
Someone was watching Tom.
I eat bread.
They answered.
My dog hurt me.
No matter how tired he is, there is work for him to do.
You're finished with the killing.
He only does it for the fans.
"A bird is better than a frog", says a friend.
She died.
He built it.
He just came.
Have you read this?
Call me tomorrow.
It's snowing.
You'll see Tom soon.
Send this letter by air.
Tom seems to agree.
Someone is coming.
It's worth a drive.
They are all happy.
The first weapon of a people's pride is its language.
Let me go!
Just look at my new car.
He was a liar.
Where did you find him?
Tom was sitting under a tree.
You can use my computer if you want.
Don't bother.
Catch up with Tom.
No one understood.
Please help me with my work.
You shouldn't be here.
The Kabyles love their language.
I have no choice.
Where are you?
Tom has a new pot.
You're going to waste Tom's money.
They all paid attention.
She swims well.
She loves to read.
Tom looks frightened.
I'll tell Tom you said that.
He gave us everything we wanted.
Tom hated Mary.
What will you do if it rains?
Our teacher hates being questioned by his students while he is teaching.
Just look at my new car.
You are a lucky man!
No one saw.
Tom did everything himself.
He burns wood easily.
Are you from Tibet?
Follow your footsteps.
Stop whining.
Did you eat dinner or not?
She doesn't smoke.
Tom looks happy.
She loves you very much.
Your writing is very good.
We hope you will come with us on many occasions.
I met Tom in October.
Are you guys Chinese?
Go for a walk!
Are you at home?
I met him only once.
Please call him on the phone.
Did you hear what they said?
The Kabyle culture is beautiful.
Tom was Mary's high school sweetheart.
Is anyone here?
Just let me in.
Eat your snacks - Millions of snacks eat them.
Stop the madness!
What were Tom and Mary fighting about?
Listen to her.
I want to kiss Tom.
Tom and Mary are about to leave.
Have you seen the new movie?
I found your bag.
He was enchanted by her beauty.
I play Chopin.
You seem to be well.
He was born rich.
Please pass me the black and white chewing gum.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
You should try to meet Tom.
I know Tom is a fool.
Tom needed about a dozen eggs.
I was told that Tom was still in Australia.
I'm going to eat at the Chinese restaurant tonight.
Tom spoke French.
Tom is not talking.
Now that I'm a teacher, I think differently.
Mary likes to buy clothes.
I don't know who killed him.
Sami is six years old.
Stop the study!
You should tell Tom the truth.
Somebody killed Tom today.
I want you to come back today.
Get out of here!
Hold him down!
Did anyone mention my name?
You look like you're from Europe.
Someone came to our house.
I want you to tell me the truth.
No, thank you. I'm all right.
Let me explain.
This boy is here.
What a fool!
Jafar is stealing the rice.
Ask one of the boys you see first.
When was the last time you were drunk?
Someone has come back.
Wanting to get some air, Tom went to the cockpit and dropped some bricks.
The water is cold.
My wife thought I was crazy.
He only talked, not cared.
I can't wait to be at your Halloween party.
Help me out here!
I know this is a long visit.
I have a cold.
Please repeat.
I don't know what you like.
French is not only spoken in France.
Stay still at all times.
Get this table.
She understood.
Go and warm up.
You're new here, aren't you?
It's a small dog.
What kind of food do you eat?
I can be stopped by anyone.
Open your eyes and look closely.
Look again.
Tom or someone else said that.
You have to stop.
Tom looks ready.
What a jerk!
I didn't know you had a brother.
Speak up!
Shut up!
Tom is unstoppable.
Get down there!
Where does Tom live?
I'm going to die!
Have you read this book yet?
Tom almost killed Mary with a knife.
We are on the verge of a typhoon.
You're not tired, are you?
Tom won the Nobel Prize in physics.
Tom didn't help Mary.
Is French here?
Open the door.
I didn't read it right.
Tom didn't want to get married.
Tell me what you think.
Is he dead?
You are our prisoner.
I like the look.
You saw Tom do that, didn't you?
Tom didn't raise his head.
None of my relatives can speak French.
There is no shame.
Today is October 20th.
My younger brother was raised by his grandmother.
I was angry.
You guys are really weird!
I'll eat it if you eat it too.
Stop your shouting.
He is important.
Is that true?
Tom was forced to quit his job.
Someone just called.
Tom dressed as a girl for Halloween.
Tom had someone break into his house last night.
What is your philosophy?
Am I wrong about that?
I won this one.
Where do you live now?
Sami seems to have lost his mind.
You are welcome home.
I'm tired of writing with you.
Truth is more important than anything else.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Someone called me.
We picked up our bags and headed straight to the market.
Are you crazy?
Tom got in front of Mary.
Sami went back to work.
Do not move.
Are you at home too?
She seems to live by the lake.
Tom came alone, not with Mary.
You kept writing.
Try to find a cure.
You had better cut your hair.
Please knock.
I'm not afraid to swim.
Kiss and kiss.
Is Jesus really the Son of God?
Tell me something.
When did you get to Boston?
From now on, we'll only speak French.
Sami feels like he knows Layla.
I just left the tavern in Ukfadu.
This is my favorite food.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Is this free?
She made me laugh.
Our food is all ruined.
Do good to those who hate you.
You can run as fast as you like, but you'll never get there on time.
Show me exactly where he lives.
To learn a language, you must know the grammar.
They all died.
I hate to work.
Be yourself.
Do you know how far Boston is from Chicago?
As soon as I was old enough, my grandson passed me.
Can you fix this?
Tom wasn't here last week.
Where is your aunt?
I believe everything we are told.
No one was hurt.
Let them help you.
We heard the door open.
Are you mad?
Are we ready?
There's someone out there.
Sami and Layla are sitting on the other side of the three-dollar bill.
They wanted something to write with.
We read these books.
Who are your parents?
Put on another coat.
Tom is a man of secrets.
What should we say?
How many pounds do you have?
French is difficult.
He is slow on the move.
I think they're watching me.
They are smoking.
People are rude in Australia.
How strong you are!
Tom likes to do things.
You are a problem.
You are a fool here.
I'm always proud of you.
I think you're wrong.
Hello! How are you?
Tom is afraid to cry too much.
Tom said he'd never planted a cabbage.
Are you crazy now?
Where did you buy your clothes?
Be strong and courageous!
You should always have a dictionary on hand.
Put your clothes on!
I hope you understand.
We left early.
You are our prisoners.
Tom has more money than enough to buy Mary what she wants.
Tom agreed.
Tom is very happy.
Come on in here!
Sami's car was very good.
Stop being a dick.
Love is alive.
Close your eyes.
Is there anyone you want to see?
How can I explain it?
Tom left on October 20.
Are you crazy?
How much?
I want someone to talk to.
I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Tom and Mary help each other.
Sami was sleeping with his girlfriend.
It took a lot of courage to do that.
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
Stay with me for a while.
Go take a cold shower.
October 20, 2013 is Arim.
Tom is finished.
Please save them.
You look European.
This cheese reminds me of Italy.
It's the third of October.
He is crying.
Snow is white, and snow is black.
Nobody cares who you are.
Your writing is terrible.
I'm very happy.
Someone stole it from me.
I'll wake you up in the morning.
Who is the best footballer in the world?
You don't have the right brains.
With your health!
You must have eaten a lot.
Murder is the crime of the people.
Does anyone in your group speak French?
Will you study today?
It's our turn!
We eat meat.
Tom drinks twice as much as Mary does.
I want to know who's in charge.
Do you want something else?
Just talk to them.
You can milk cows.
Get out of the way!
You just put them together.
She is sick.
My life is in your hands.
I'm looking for one.
I hope no one sees you like this.
The food!
Tom will always remember Mary.
Tom doesn't know Mary.
Tom walked.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
What is your theory of what happened?
I'm washing my clothes.
I was chased by a bear.
The truth is, I don't like chicken.
His father never went abroad.
How many books have you read?
You sound like your mother.
I'm worried about Tom.
Are you Ukrainians?
It doesn't matter.
It's best to start right away.
What is the tallest building in Boston?
I have learned.
When will you eat?
I listen to music.
I'll call you this evening.
Someone is starting a fire.
I'm glad I didn't know.
Tom was robbed last night.
Tom didn't raise his head.
I'm not tired today.
Do you like Tom's guitar?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to succeed.
Try to convince Tom to leave early for that.
Put oil on the fire.
Everything is going to change.
Tom fought Mary in front of everyone.
You kissed each other.
If you need me, call.
They don't sing.
Please don't break my neck.
Can you fix this?
Tom is lying down.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
I think Tom is crazy.
He pressed hard on it, and it broke.
We got married on October 20th.
I'm sure they were wrong.
I want to eat some pork chops.
Tom shouldn't know where Mary lives.
Do you like science fiction films?
They speak French.
It's better if you tell the truth.
Close the window!
They eat these things.
Tom is the smart one.
It's a thief!
Why are you so hard on me?
No one knows what the future holds.
Someone has to do it.
Tom gave the teacher an apple.
Did you sleep well?
Tom seems strong.
Everyone was happy that Tom was arrested.
Do you have a sauce or something?
The color of the sky is pink.
I know where they are.
I understand
I wish I were in the best of health to do that.
Tom doesn't live in Australia.
You're at home.
If you're hungry, you'll miss the train.
I met a man who knew Tom.
Look closely.
I like pop music.
No one said that.
Everybody is laughing.
After all, this book is a joke.
Do you go to school by train?
Why do people lie?
One day I'll buy the train that makes my grandfather's clothes.
Do you think we will win?
Knock again.
There is no wolf inside.
I said good night.
Tom will stay here.
I think his opinion is important.
Just look at my new car.
Stop your chatter!
This table is sealed.
Water, please.
This will make you stronger.
Sami is quick to respond on Facebook.
Someone broke this plate.
She didn't study music.
I don't know where he is.
I got caught in the rain.
I know.
What kind of paper do you want?
She is dreaming.
Does Tom work in Australia?
You two.
I can't write this right.
Your father is a bigot.
Tom sat on the couch next to Mary.
Phrases like "Muslims love Jesus and Moses,... or the devil" seem to be a clear distinction between the religious and the religious, and the Orthodox and Evangelicals are a distant second. Until I saw their TRUMPY, which was worn between the robes and the columns, I thought: that's why they agreed, our "community", to help the cause. The Tadeyanit added only the USEKCEM to the list of those who became the head of the Iranian and the Islamic communities and the Kamasutra.
Where is your grandmother?
My sister is a very pretty girl.
Are you Anna?
Please find him.
Stay here and wait until Tom comes.
Have you seen your desk?
Are you Hungarian?
Look, that child, he's about to get himself wet.
My food is here.
The office is full of people.
I've already received a call.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom ran away.
Tom came to visit Mary.
Who are they talking to?
There's no money in my purse.
The animals were frightened by the noise.
Tom is a realist.
You are blinded by love.
Everybody knows her.
Please help me open this door.
Can you please open the door for me?
Get your hands off me.
You expect too much of him.
I probably shouldn't have asked Tom that question.
Stop whining.
You are beautiful.
Are you waiting for someone?
This girl is beautiful.
Stop fighting each other.
Keep it down!
Hurry up.
This happened on October 20th.
How tall are you?
You are a great writer.
I love my brothers and sisters.
Don't use this machine near water.
I wish you always went this way.
It's very hard to figure out what this is.
Stay with us.
Tom left them.
I wish it would always be like this.
Put your feet here!
I want you to read this letter.
You are a liar.
Tom is smelly.
You heard him, didn't you?
You are dead.
I know Tom is a student.
We bought a bottle of water.
It's on your head!
Somebody has to do something.
Leave it all behind.
I can teach you how to read.
He is one of my father's students.
I am very hungry
You should apologize.
Sami had a bad day.

Please help him.
Have you tried the chicken?
Someone is waiting for you.
The girl resembles her mother.
Tom returned in October last year.
These things are very useful.
To be honest, I'm not a man and a woman.
I want to try to do something else.
Have you all read it?
Please don't die.
Some people know.
You are proud of your country.
Tom told Mary something.
Look carefully. I'll show you how to do it.
I haven't been to Boston since October.
Tom has lost his temper.
I bought you something to eat.
The test is almost over.
Go and find Tom.
There is no doubt!
Tom tried to stab Mary.
He wants to do what Tom says.
Do you think I should do that?
Tom died in Boston at the age of thirty.
Take these.
Tom was a wimp.
Tom seems very young.
My dog has a long tail.
Tom seemed a little upset when I called yesterday.
I went out with a girl in high school who speaks French.
You are Americans.
Tom was chased by a police officer.
Hey, you guys.
You are the apple of my eye.
Free the animals from their cages.
I'll buy it for you.
You have to apologize.
I know Tom doesn't want to get involved.
You're making me laugh!
She went to Boston.
Someone is watching us.
He didn't refuse, he didn't want to.
Tom didn't know I was hungry.
Tom is going to be a third-year on October 20.
I like to eat pork.
I don't think so about that.
Welcome home to you.
You are a dog.
Who invited you to the wedding?
Where did you forget your umbrella?
What do you think of her new novel?
What a handsome young man!
I don't think I should speak like a native speaker. I just want to be able to talk to a native speaker.
Yes, two.
You should read this.
I wish no one would look at me like that.
I'm getting used to the dark.
I can teach you how to sing.
My father is used to walking.
Tom hated Mary.
I'm not your maid!
How can a simple man like you eat so much?
Are you a fool?
Thank you for your attention.
Just look at my new car.
Where was I?
It is a good thing.
Which paper do you want?
That's where you're wrong.
October is still three months away.
I wish it would always be like this.
There's more.
Tom started to get tired.
Stay for a while.
You're obviously wrong.
Many houses were burned.
Why don't they say anything?
Tom is staying with someone.
I'm afraid we won't get there early.
My mother's father is my mother's maternal grandfather.
No one knows.
You are always together.
There's nothing there.
Keep running!
I hope you learned from some of your mistakes.
You should write a novel.
Someone called you.
I prefer to sleep at night.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
Do you play sports?
You are.
Your word is worthless.
Are you a rich woman?
You may forget us!
Are you finished?
We finished it.
Above all, be faithful to your elders.
This is your brain, isn't it?
I hate to fail.
Somebody has to go first.
Sami got into Layla's car.
I hope you will listen to me.
Good afternoon.
He went to Facebook.
I bought it.
They don't need anything.
Say something.
Tom is angry.
The fingers of the hand are stronger.
Tom never gave a pen to anyone.
Everybody is talking.
Tom knows you're lying.
What else?
Did you fight with them or not?
What can I say!
I will take the exam in October.
You are bored.
To your health!
Tom doesn't know I'm here.
"Destruction is not yet here", said Titus Livus.
You are all very kind.
You were praying.
It's all right!
I know you're right.
I'll call you before I leave.
I can't go swimming with you today.
She drank a lot of water.
Read your book.
When someone is chasing you, don't bother.
Why are you crying?
She is studying.
Tom likes Mary.
He is used to getting up early.
Her hair grew.
Look at her.
Tom confessed to killing Mary.
You know the way.
What's wrong with me going to Boston by myself?
Write in Spanish.
You should ask someone else.
He is not a pariah.
It's too heavy for us to lift.
Please don't be ashamed.
The flowers are beautiful!
How do you not know?
The Kabyle people have always lived in isolation even during the Turkish invasion of North Africa.
It seems like we should do this.
Come on, you guys!
Stop the prayer.
They have a problem.
Wipe the apple before eating it.
Tom said that he should study French.
Tom is swimming.
They must be asleep.
Good news awaits us at home.
Get your ass down!
I threw something on the fire.
Stop that!
I want to show you some translated texts for the library.
I don't know him.
Tell him I love you.
Did you hear what they said?
I hope no one saw you.
Mine is bigger than yours.
I said what I had in my heart.
I love the lemonade.
Shake it off!
I flew to Boston on October 20th.
I'll buy it for you.
Tom was robbed.
Keep running!
Someone will do it.
Go and shave.
This trend is down to four cases a day.
Tom is fine.
Wear it with a skirt.
How are you?
Are you laughing at me?
Her eyes are red.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
Are you scared?
Tom is tired.
I left my keys in the car!
Wait outside.
Did my friend please you?
No one is listening.
My jaw is sore.
Why doesn't Tom want you here?
The police believe that Tom was stabbed before he could cut his throat.
Tom didn't know what Mary was thinking.
No one remembers.
What is your father's secret?
Faith is not a virtue. It is a mistake that makes people believe.
I won't let you go.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
These pictures are beautiful.
Can you speak French?
Tom hopes to be in Boston by the end of October.
What are you doing?
Help me with this.
Tom forgot Mary's phone number.
Am I making you happy or not?
I speak French better than Tom.
Sami followed me on Snapchat.
I saw someone say hello to Tom.
Tom called me.
She is one of the greatest scientists in Japan.
She lied.
Are you ready?
Don't leave the neighborhood unattended.
Tom is the son of a well-known teacher in Boston.
Can we say yes?
I bought some new bread.
It is not the wise who believe.
Why this exaggeration?
You are our prisoners.
Are you busy now?
She forgets him.
We are not crazy right now.
Where did you get this piece of your hat?
Do you want me to call him?
I want you to stay in Australia, you who have the alarm and the alarm.
I hope to see you in October.
I didn't think Tom needed our help.
Tom doesn't know that I know.
He looks good.
Your father has a temper.
Tom was the last person to see Mary alive.
Tom is lying on the table.
Let her go.
That's right.
I missed you so much!
Tom knocked on the door again.
Are you two sisters?
Tom will never change.
Tom forbade anyone to steal his food.
He likes to read books.
He went to see her when she lived in London.
Someone is missing.
The cat is back.
How are things in Australia?
Tom likes to talk about art.
I need you to do something.
Sami never talked about Layla.
Let me look at what you wrote.
Tom saw her, too.
Keep it warm.
Tom is not married.
He was looking for his pen.
They understood.
The exams will be held after October 20.
I'm expecting a child.
I can't see very well.
Just shut up.
I'm going to go.
I don't have any money in my pockets.
The dinosaurs are a great threat to mankind.
They all left.
You made me.
I hope no one saw you come all the way here.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Why don't we let you do that?
I have only one question.
We don't use the sword until it is needed.
I wish I could play guitar.
Hold your horses!
Come with me.
Both Tom and Mary don't know how to speak French.
Tom gave Mary a gift.
Read it out.
Say hello to him.
How I miss you!
Someone has to pay.
I like to watch westerns.
Tom hated Mary.
Please be quiet.
They are so sweet.
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
She refused.
I don't have many friends in Boston.
We have nothing to eat.
Are you ready to go?
Sami entered the store.
Please laugh!
I want to travel abroad.
Where do you live now?
Tom said he could come back on October 20th.
Walk carefully.
Call him if you have any questions.
I'm going to go on a trip now.
We all hate you.
She can come.
Which paper is right for you?
Follow Tom!
I hope no one saw you come here.
Is your father having dinner with you tonight?
I left Australia on October 20th.
She loves him.
I'm going to go out and get something to eat.
He was drunk.
The first day of school showed me that Tom had done well.
He is looking after his father's apartment.
We must establish laws against violence in workplaces, housing, education, and education. This is what our governments and institutions are fighting for.
When will you come to see me?
The coronavirus has caused a public outcry.
Just tell her what she said.
This is easy.
I'll go with you.
Have you lost your mind?
Tom was passing Mary.
Just do what I did!
You are wrong.
Tom built a house that was so big.
Someone stole my money.
Your letters are terrible.
I was lying when I said I didn't like Tom.
No one was hurt.
I start working on the first of July.
We can do a lot to help these families.
I don't understand any of this.
Tom will spare Mary.
Tom pulled out a card.
Mary's sentences are easy to translate.
They're making fun of you.
You speak my language.
I'm happy here.
When Tom and I went to Boston, we visited Mary.
Read this book when you have time.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Come and answer me verbally.
Tom was lucky.
What can I say!
Tom asked Mary.
It's a long way to go.
Try to make him laugh.
Are you ready?
Someone was following us.
You remind me of someone.
Put your bags down.
We want to get to know you.
Does everyone like music?
I was drunk.
Let the animals out of their cages.
Hurry up and get dressed.
So what do you want?
He got up.
Tom and I made fun of Mary.
He did well!
They all sat down.
Have a drink!
Does she not understand?
I have your number.
Hello, what's your name?
Tom and Mary knew they had to do that.
The police are looking for me.
We are proud!
Are you a foreigner?
There was a large crowd waiting.
Tom said goodbye to Mary.
She has your dreams.
I'll show you how it's done.
Say goodbye to your friends.
Probably not.
Tom is upset.
Tom got the news that Mary was following him.
It was too late.
She came after Tom.
Read this book.
Tom said he didn't think he'd get hurt.
They still have us.
What time will you get home?
Is anyone hurt?
I hope no one saw you come here.
Tom is a thief.
This party is not for you.
You are like the man who built a house with bricks and tiles.
Everybody knows.
Nobody wants to be involved.
I brought you some food.
Tom invited us to sing.
Will you please let us go now?
The river is very deep.
Read this book.
I can't get it off.
I like it a lot.
I heard what happened.
Sami and Layla haven't lived together for six years.
Are you guys back to normal?
She hates Algerian culture.
I'm going to take a nap.
This is my phone.
I can stay in Boston until October.
Do you care what people think about us?
I work for Muḥend Belqasem's Facebook page every Thursday.
Sami is a criminal.
If you want to leave, leave now!
We've been looking for you everywhere.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Tom said he wasn't talking to you.
You are part of the problem.
Have we met before?
She speaks ten languages.
If you eat it, you will die.
It's a race against time.
This is what we have.
I think I understood.
It's a little hot today.
Is that Tom's sister, there?
Tom is angry.
Tom thinks about Mary all the time.
Tom didn't mention you.
Dreams are beautiful!
Tom said that he had never driven a truck.
Has anyone seen anything?
I know Tom is a billionaire.
She laughed.
This will warm you up.
I hope it was a dream.
You are blinded by love.
You woke me up!
Who complained?
Are you Julius?
Do you have any other questions?
Tom isn't like that.
You'll find someone.
Stop crying.
It is Kabyle.
He didn't take a look at it.
Are you human?
All my worries are over.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Alice smiled at me.
The truth is, I'm neither male nor female.
Please lock the door.
Enjoy the life!
I don't want to go alone.
The stone said to the stone: I will break. The stone replied: "What shall I say?"
God will fight you like ants: one will attack the other.
Somebody has to do it.
My son has become a man.
Do you mind if I ask an unrelated question?
I've got you.
Tom knows.
Have you read?
I lost.
I was recently inspired by a poem he wrote about his mother's death.
Wash your faces!
They broke up.
Tom is a better singer than Mary.
Do you cook or do you do anything else?
Tom likes to play football.
Sami still has his guitar.
They all love you.
Neither Tom nor I are right.
Where is your mother?
Come out now!
They all sang.
If you translate from your second language into your native language instead of taking another language, you are more likely to make mistakes.
Did you do all that?
Let them help you.
Are you helping him?
Neither Tom nor Mary asked for help.
There is no democracy where there is no democracy.
The one who eats the poor, hates the poor.
Tom and Mary are the same height.
Has anyone died?
No one cared.
Tom is jealous of her.
Are you lying?
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'm doing the right thing.
Sami read Layla's message.
I want you to get up.
You refused to pay.
Tom continued to read.
Are you kidding?
Tom was attracted to Mary.
You have to do this job.
I think you did it unintentionally.
She studies English.
I'm from the South.
Are you crazy?
They all shook hands.
Tom and Mary are like John and Alice.
They are naked.
You should talk to Tom.
Who ran?
Tom's birthday is on October twelfth.
She forgot it.
A small pot boils a large pot.
Tom is surprised.
I saw a dog.
I was very scared.
Please help me.
The festival will start in October.
Tell me again who will help us.
I can't just leave you here.
Sami doesn't know who this master is.
What do they call this fruit?
Please take me home.
I hope no one saw you do it.
I like the way you kiss me.
Are you done with your work?
What is that language?
You are a good student.
Is this a sculpture?
You'll find someone left him here.
Who are they?
Are you ashamed?
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
Keep moving!
Tom and I followed Mary.
It's not easy to be a lawyer.
Why does Tom need a knife?
Tom is sleeping.
Come back to us!
If you don't want to read, stop.
Are you crazy?
I bought a box of matches.
We crossed over there.
Let's dance some more.
Please.
Somebody has to do something.
They fell.
Are you finished?
Is this idiot your friend?
Mary knows that I believe her.
Change your clothes!
We wanted to listen.
Aren't you happy that she's rich?
Look around. What do you see?
Say what you want, I don't believe you.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Sami was out that night.
Take this.
They all make jokes.
Tom thought no one had seen him.
What do you feed your puppy?
I'm not your lover.
Sami went to the game.
Tom moved to Boston in October.
The moon is still shining.
Thank you for your call.
There is one I know.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
Tom waited his turn.
Tom said he never smoked again.
You have me fooled!
Kurt Cobain died on April 5, 1994 in Seattle.
I will be back in October.
I have a daughter.
Tom felt uncomfortable.
The Regent visited the castle.
She swims well.
I will pay with money.
It's almost over.
Can you please explain to Tom?
Tom bought this for us.
I don't want to go to the party.
I like to read.
Tom was furious that he had insulted Mary.
Give me a kilo of tomatoes, please.
Take good care of yourself.
Sami felt something move against his chest.
Ken is a genius.
You should eat something.
Are you finished?
Take me to the top.
Why did you write this book?
Tom wants Mary.
Stop reading!
No one is inside.
Say goodbye to me.
You can't stop us.
My conservative grandfather always criticized the way girls dress now.
This is for you.
Don't forget to tell Tom to do that today.
Thank you!
Did you know that Zinedine Zidane is a Kabyle?
Please feed the dog every day.
I have to look after Tom.
I think you're a fool.
Just let me in.
Are you Canadian?
You're making fun of me.
I still hate Tom.
The exhibition will be held until October 20th.
Please.
What you said is correct.
I have to go to Australia next week.
Is there someone you want to read to?
He helped!
I could kill you.
Are you making him a sandwich?
Tom told me that he loved you very much.
You have everything.
Tea with lemon, please.
I feel good about myself.
Let the animals out of the pen.
Tom was supposed to be back.
It's been an hour since you called me.
Shut up !
Sami and Layla were engaged.
You look like you're from Japan.
Go to school!
I was crying.
Sami taught Layla how to play the guitar.
He's got your mind.
I brought you coffee.
Tom has been told that many times.
Tom told Mary something.
She is very smart.
That's what happens.
Mary told me she was lucky.
Does Tom know much about you?
You're making me mad!
There is no problem at all.
You are laughing.
We should go again.
Someone knows something.
I fell asleep when I kissed Tom.
You are shy.
Just look at my new car.
I was happy.
You have a fever.
We are reunited.
Who won?
Look at this!
Tom will miss.
I don't know if I have time.
Did you find Tom's note?
Sam published his autobiography.
She understood him.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
There is someone in the house.
Tom is participating.
He showed them.
Come on, all of you!
Come back when you like.
You are idiots.
Just follow him.
Tom looked me in the eyes.
It may come.
I need someone to help me.
Why does Tom need me?
You made me sick!
Are you really going to send me a Japanese doll?
Sami sees Layla once a year.
Come to us!
You didn't have to do that at all.
Tom is being watched.
So, what's his excuse?
He died!
Say goodbye to your friends.
The girls are waiting.
I did this without anyone's help.
Stop scratching my head.
Tom never thought he'd do that.
Sami doesn't need this.
I can go to your house tomorrow.
I'm not going swimming today.
Your words have no meaning.
Tom looks happy.
I was born in this hospital.
Are you a thief?
I need you to do one thing.
You told me the truth.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
You have a toothbrush in your teeth.
Give it to whoever wants it.
How many friends do you have who don't eat meat?
Do you have time for a meal?
They stink to everyone.
Tom asked us to be quiet.
She died of a stroke.
Tell me something I don't know.
Who painted it?
Marie should start.
It is true.
Let go of me!
You must not make mistakes.
The bees are making a nest.
I'm tired of it.
Cut it off!
Where did you study?
You are human beings.
I have lost my life.
They are all waiting.
You are lucky to have come from a family.
The trees are tall.
Call them.
Is Tom playing?
Meet me there.
There must be someone who can stop us.
Someone is cheating on Tom.
Stop being so mean.
Tell him that.
I laughed.
Tom was working with Mary.
Tom is sweating.
She was the only one who was drunk at the party.
Do you know me? - No, I don't think so.
Tom can understand Mary.
Hello to everyone.
God is terrified!
I hope Tom will leave me alone.
Your cake is very dry, my friend.
Do you know how this works?
Follow your sister's path.
I'm worried about her.
I got them all out.
Tom and Mary are as different as black and white.
Tom never learned how to read or write.
This will make you stronger.
Tom is your father.
He was born with his mother.
Why don't you want to go to Tom's house?
You look lovely this evening.
Tom is having dinner now.
Tom died in October.
Work is going fast.
Tom was right about Mary.
We all hate him.
They bought a bottle of water.
You were supposed to do it yesterday.
Is that what love is?
Is there anything you don't like to eat?
Someone stole my car.
I haven't read it.
Tom will run away from us.
The Lebanese journalist and her friends wrote a book.
Tom already plans to leave early.
You just did it.
Tom left the country on October 20.
How can we buy British horses?
She needs to rest.
You've already paid.
Tom said it was hard to do.
I wrote a Kabyle on Tatoeba a long time ago.
Who were you expecting to win?
Tom likes to party.
The young girl is popular among Japanese students.
The stone said to the lock: "I will open it". The lock said: "What will I say?"
I'll show you how it's done.
You knew Tom was going to do that, didn't you?
You are a fool.
There is water for two days.
Do you have any cats?
Tom wanted to help Mary.
Tom is a very smart boy.
Have you not read this book?
You can't speak French, can you?
You were wrong.
She will stay with him.
When is the next flight to Boston?
I heard you don't eat meat.
I have a word.
Tom deleted his blog in October.
Are you ready to eat all of this?
You're not really a farmer.
Are you Americans?
Show me the special one.
I thought you couldn't read.
Your writing is very good.
Tom is almost dead.
The chicken is crying, the hen is hurt in the neck.
Stop them!
Tom only slept for a few hours.
Why are you staring at Tom?
You are more tired.
I didn't think Tom would be this tired.
Come by any time you want.
You can use my dictionary.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Read this now.
Tom has noticed.
Did you swim yesterday?
Start the fire!
When was the last time you went to Boston?
Tom told her that he had written the poem two years earlier.
He's been here a long time.
I'm afraid for you.
Have you read this?
I laughed.
You are afraid.
You can go home now.
You are a dog.
Some children said they were swimming in the river.
How much are the sandwiches for?
Thank you all.
Tom is alone.
Being here has helped me a lot.
A man went to his friend's house; when he returned, he found the girl. Her mother smiled and said to her, "Are these really the truth?" He replied, "Oh, as soon as I ate the apple, I said yes!" "The truth, then... Your father will be very happy!" So!
Someone is eating something.
What a person does, whether it is literature, music, art, poetry, or anything else, always comes out as a reflection of himself.
I'm not sure.
I like to travel.
Where is your grandmother?
Why don't you pay attention to what the teacher is saying?
How do you want your eggs?
Tom said that he wanted to be buried in Australia.
There is a piano in the room.
I used to fall in the snow when I was little.
Tom and I are married now.
Someone stole my food.
You are driving.
What are you looking for, man?
He ate.
What's your room number?
I told the truth.
Do you have any friends?
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
Tom is better singer than Mary.
I assume you like your job.
The authors of these notes are not mine.
I brought you coffee.
Tom was fired in October.
Ahmed is full of energy.
Clean your room.
Why don't you go and see Tom?
Tom told me that he loved me.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
I'm a good friend of Tom's father.
This is hard for you, isn't it?
Has there been any change?
The game is too long.
It has been snowing since dawn.
Freedom comes with forgiveness.
Richard Dawkins is a famous philosopher.
Where is your God now?
Are you hungry or not?
I wrote you a play.
They all danced.
Have you tried it?
This is their last film.
You are a little tired.
Are you hungry?
Tom didn't know exactly how to describe it.
Can I go home now?
You are lying.
You have nothing to be angry about.
Tom grinned to say he wouldn't come.
Poetry is medicine.
He asked again.
Sami started with this man.
Go to the shadow!
What do you like more, meat or fish?
Come out of the closet.
I brought you lunch today.
Tom won't be back until October.
Can you show me the door?
Someone approached the door.
Tom wanted to forget Mary.
Tom ran to the counter to see what was there.
You've figured out what this is!
You don't have the right pain.
He can do that.
They sing.
I fear it will rain this afternoon.
She never kept her word.
The computer is broken.
If you have any problems, call.
They are lying.
Are you at home?
I want to appear to be rich.
My brain is racing!
How I missed you!
We are expecting guests this evening.
We both hate her.
Don't forget the first sentence.
I speak French.
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.
Someone has stolen my passport.
Will you come to Montreal this weekend?
Why?
I'll come and help you.
You'd be wise to keep working in a place like this.
He is a thief.
A two for one, bro for one.
Tom was struck in the heart by a bullet from the gun.
It seemed as if Tom had just put me in his eyes.
This is not my business.
The snow is falling on the grass.
Kiss her now.
It stinks like that!
I have forgotten.
You should be stopped.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
Sami smells my things.
You should talk to Tom.
Write it in French.
Something has happened.
Stay with me.
Speak slowly.
Tom doesn't like to wait until they are found to do something.
I talked to Tom.
Tom was killed.
Remember that!
Please don't die.
Tom is going to be the third on October 20.
Sami is a very good person.
Do you hear me well now?
Breathe in and out!
She didn't listen to the children.
I think Tom has guts.
You have a very beautiful smile.
Who is this book for?
I'm pretty sure Tom is in love with Mary.
Call him up.
This is a new car.
Your day has come!
They're making fun of you.
Look ahead of you.
What happened then?
She stopped talking.
I want you to go with Tom.
The child with the flu was under close medical care.
What did he say?
Say what you want, I don't believe you.
There is no life without water.
You are so beautiful.
Have you gone?
We like to learn music.
Run this way!
My father doesn't know her.
People here speak French.
Bring the horse.
Tom hopes to be back by the end of October.
Can you leave the door open?
The pig!
Pay attention to your behavior.
Tom is a jerk, isn't he?
You danced.
Tom had someone talk to him.
I hope no one has seen you since you got here.
He speaks English well.
Tom is out of his mind.
You are all idiots.
Are you listening?
Thank you for your offer.
Is that wine?
You take care.
We should think of the worst that could happen.
Are you rich?
Tom is asleep.
I went to school with him.
I want you to work with them.
She is happy.
He hates me!
Tom and Mary went to her.
He is a good writer.
Where is your aunt?
Tom asked for a hard hat.
She is blind.
I am blind in one eye.
No one is inside.
I feel so alone these days.
I wish you a day of light and flowers with chemicals.
I'm not very good at it.
I'm going to assume that's not true.
Sit with me.
What is your favorite team?
He was very shy.
What?
I will dream of you.
Give examples.
Anyone can see us.
What do you feed your puppy?
Watch what you eat.
We studied English.
I am upset with you.
My computer is broken.
Just take me home.
Let me cry, or I'll call the police!
Look closely!
The black hen laughed at the old one.
Tom and I both want to go.
Thank you for your concern.
Put your arm around you.
Tom said no one was there.
She got up.
He's at home today.
Please read it again.
Do you mind if I ask an unanswered question?
Tom started talking.
Can you please wait a minute?
Let me remind you of something.
I tried to do that one more time.
Can you help me?
Can you wait?
I'll tell you a secret.
I can teach you how to read.
You're too hard on yourself!
Somebody has to do something.
Tom is getting ready for the party.
Sami didn't receive the last message.
Where are you?
I hope you've told me sooner.
The elders thought they were the only ones who were right.
Have you read this?
I'll read to you on Monday.
No, I don't know your brother.
I'm not running.
What's going on here now?
Is that it?
Are you cheating on me?
I didn't wash your car.
I was born in Boston.
Dinner is ready.
I released the animals from their cages.
I must know them.
Do you want something to drink?
You are all happy.
If you ask me, it's a waste of time.
Tom thought Mary would do that.
The one who fights may lose, but the one who doesn't fight has already lost.
You are American.
Someone is sleeping here.
You lost this.
You keep fighting.
It is snowing.
Are you going to study today?
You refuse to pay.
Did he use it?
I haven't said anything yet.
We were friends.
I wrote you a note.
I'll meet you at the airport.
There's a word.
Someone is waiting for you.
Look in front of you.
I like reading books.
I'm glad you won.
Thank you.
How many of these do you need?
Look at us!
I like to travel.
Tom and I were good friends.
Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
Stay in there.
Tom comes to Boston every weekend to see Mary.
Tom made a mistake.
Are you ashamed?
Tom put his feet on the ground.
Thank you very much.
You can't just come in like that.
How beautiful you are!
They were looking for me.
I just want to get married.
I like to read.
Write it down in French.
Will you do that for me?
I heard Tom's call.
Tom lives near the beach, but he can't swim.
I don't know how much he wears.
Pick up another pen.
Your luck is not good.
My friend doesn't know.
Are you from out of town?
Are you waiting for someone?
Tom is being watched.
Tom turned around to Mary.
Please read this book.
We'll be waiting for you here.
Tom is confused.
Tom didn't understand very well.
I told the truth.
Do you have a dog?
Are you working?
Are you eating?
Stop that!
Tom can't trust Mary.
No one saw you.
We are married.
The matter is resolved!
Everybody blames you.
Answer me with your word.
Tom is taking off his clothes.
We should save him forever.
We'll send someone to the hospital.
You must have eaten a lot.
I'm trying to find another plan.
How much chocolate did you eat?
How is Tom?
This has to stop.
Tom is sick.
Did someone hit Tom?
Tom is in love with Mary.
What are you all afraid of?
You've already invited me to one.
Bring some food.
What's your favorite novel?
The dog is cold.
Are you waiting for Tom?
I wish them a year of peace and prosperity.
The conversation stopped.
Come again for a second.
You are lucky.
You can change that if you want.
Stop talking to me.
Tom just wanted a cup of tea.
You tried to get Tom to agree.
I beg your pardon!
How I miss you!
You should just call Jean.
In my opinion, you're wrong.
Stop shouting!
You have to wake someone up.
Tom hated Mary.
Have you read this?
I'm very happy for your efforts.
I feel sorry for Tom.
I hope nothing happened to him.
Follow your own path.
The word "family" has three syllables.
You are in Boston.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
I have something to give you.
Make two mistakes.
He likes to be rude.
Tom can rest as long as he wants.
Sami was reading a message to Layla.
His suitcase is covered with a plaid.
I know I can count on you.
Who are you?
Shut up Tom!
Welcome to Canada!
A dog passes by a dog only once.
They live there.
Someone is talking.
I should be there early.
I'll come and help you.
They are all outside.
You should take this into consideration.
Keep it warm.
Did you eat enough?
You are idiots.
I know you're here, Tom.
She hides her secret.
Why did you leave?
It's not a hard thing to do.
I'd like you to introduce me to Tom.
What are you going to work on?
If she changes, she will be better for the next month.
You take care.
Someone made a mistake.
I didn't hold your foot down.
Two beers, please.
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee.
I can't wait to see you.
Stop laughing.
I'm going to buy something to eat.
Tom will also attend the wedding.
Come to my room.
Tom didn't come back.
Do you remember?
Stop fighting each other.
Tom always wanted to go out with you.
Speak up!
Tom wants Mary.
Tom is a coward.
Tom is pissed.
I haven't seen Tom in three days.
Are you brothers?
I'm at a loss for words.
I don't love you anymore.
You didn't save Tom a lot of money.
I want to know who's going with us.
The top leaders met at dawn.
Have you answered yet?
Tom lived with his parents in Australia.
I'm tired of this, aren't I?
Where is your aunt?
Someone is waiting for you.
Show me your true face.
He is good.
I was in her room.
You are a fish.
Tom walked by.
You can have my car.
Tom showered with cold water.
There was a fire and a thunderstorm, and they kept on fighting.
What's your name?
Have you read everything?
Sami speaks with his hands.
I believed everything they told us.
Tom told us a lot about you.
Tom was just silent.
Tom is all mine.
Are you going to leave me?
Do you brush your teeth?
I think he's lost his mind.
Do you want eggs?
Please remember to say hello to your family.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
May I see what's in here, please?
Do you like dogs?
Don't go near the place.
The ground was covered in blood.
I know I can rely on you.
He is a Kabyle.
Tom can't come today.
Where are we going to eat?
Your day will come.
Mr. White was the manager.
You're too fast for him.
You are walking fast.
They smiled.
Somebody has to do something.
What is your philosophy?
Put on your coat. It's cold outside.
Who hacked my computer?
Be careful with your clothes.
I really love you both.
You're going to have to try.
I don't want to leave you here alone.
It is easier for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than for a poor man to go through the eye of a needle.
Tom didn't go to the school Mary went to.
Tom had no choice but to stay.
Brush your teeth before you fall!
Please help me!
Please leave it.
Tom is planning to go by himself.
I'm starting a new life.
The wedding took place on 20 October 2013.
Aren't you hungry?
I think it's a beautiful beach.
I need to know someone.
Are you idiots?
Tom read slowly.
Please lend me your car.
Did they get tested?
She sat there in silence.
Somebody has to do it.
Are you Swedes?
I live in Australia.
I think Tom is a jerk.
You are lying.
Can you swim?
I've been in Boston for three months.
Don't talk about that.
I just need someone's help.
The first note is sweet.
The car stopped.
Choose carefully.
Tom was released from prison in October.
I know about that.
I understand your reasons.
Why are you crying?
We want to get to know you.
You should eat.
The birds are talking to the bees.
They are all tired.
Have you ever read it?
Do you want me to go with you?
I never saw him again.
Is Tom from Australia?
Have you ever ridden a bike to school?
Tom must have prepared something.
Stop the car!
Don't bother.
Is he the son of Japu?
This is a good show.
When will you consider me your friend?
Can anyone help me?
What do you want from Tom?
Please call him on the phone.
How far is it?
How lucky you were to move to Boston.
I hope no one saw you come all the way here.
Why did Tom cry?
Are you okay?
Let's eat now.
I never liked you.
What a joy!
We left on October 20th.
I thought you might recognize Tom.
Tell it to her.
You're on time.
Don't give me the cold shoulder.
I bought this.
Tom and the other monks prayed for rain.
They all love you.
Tom is not my son.
He found you naked.
Someone must have stopped you.
It is the 20th of October.
Tom was the one who told me a story.
Are you ready?
Put the paper in the jar.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Tom told me he saw who gave Mary her hat.
Stop crying!
I was a little out of luck.
You're wrong about me.
My mother made me a new dress.
Are you lucky?
I lost my mind.
They know the truth.
I hope you're right.
I read ten books this month.
I know I'm forgetting something.
We built it.
Tom shook his hand.
Are you saying something?
She smells good.
They were surprised.
Did Moses really hear God speak?
She is dead.
No one is helping us.
Go now.
Eat as much as you can.
Hold your horses!
Spend this one.
Tom is better than everyone else.
We got married in October.
Tom called me.
You should eat.
Tom is not dead.
Someone was killed.
His idea is better than yours.
Does he have a sister?
Don't come near me.
Watch your ears.
Is it hot outside?
Please think.
You seem to like this.
I've been thinking about this all day.
He is clever.
Have you been to Tibet?
Stop shouting, open the door!
She is walking.
I haven't studied French in over thirteen years.
You shouldn't be calling at this time of day.
Do you live here?
Do you know what you did?
I trust you.
Close your book.
Why don't you sit down? The seat is empty.
I'm very fond of the cabinets.
Stop teaching!
This place is full of crap.
Did you eat your snacks?
Go slowly.
My life is in your hands.
The race will begin on October 20.
Do you still eat meat?
Just talk to them.
They all speak French.
I missed you so much.
Tom tried to seduce Mary.
Tom told me you weren't happy.
I am your father.
What are these people doing?
If you had listened to me, this wouldn't have happened.
He grabbed my bones.
What's new here?
Are you tired?
Pray for the whale.
Get out of here!
So why are you here?
Tom almost drowned.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.
I can't do this without your help.
I like life.
Have you seen anyone here?
What plan have we prepared?
There are demons.
You told the dog to stay, didn't you?
Reading and writing in Kabyle became a habit for us.
You nodded.
The weather was very difficult.
You seem to be worried.
Both Tom and Mary don't speak French well.
I'm going to ask for some more details.
There is someone waiting.
They all laughed.
I would like a red wine, please.
He's out of gas.
Tom can't eat on his own.
Tom wanted our help.
I was in my prime.
I sold computers.
The correlation between languages can vary greatly.
Tom and Mary and I are about to go to Boston.
I don't like Tom and that.
They're all gone.
Do you need any help, my friend?
The three sisters are brothers.
They are very friendly.
I'm not your friend.
Tom could show Mary.
Tom is a geek.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
You can have your money back if you want it.
They left early.
Stop and listen!
Tom was being beaten by Mary.
Mary resisted.
Are you at home?
Let me know when you'll call me.
I love you just the way you are.
Excuse me, who are you?
Are you crazy?
He could hurt someone.
None of these books are useful.
Why are you so angry?
There's someone waiting for you.
Tom is better than Mary at playing the flute.
Tom is saying that he is feeling better.
He has found them.
He is tall.
You are wrong.
Do you think I will live?
Tom is out of his mind.
He is not the same as before.
You can eat as much as you want today.
Will they come again?
We played a game.
Look behind you.
I'm here because of you.
I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you.
Sami took a lunch break.
Do you think anyone can see me?
I have nothing to say.
It's been a while since Tom made a joke on the phone.
You are beautiful.
Tom got angry while he was cleaning the kitchen.
I hate Tom.
No one looked.
Tom told me not to go there alone.
What do you want to do?
Come and see me.
You should read this.
Are you two gay?
There was singing.
Tom and Mary are farmers.
Please close it.
I don't like to eat where people smoke.
I don't think Tom needs any help.
Write to me!
Kill me, please.
He is running.
Have you talked to your wife?
Why are they so afraid?
I'm still in Australia, but I'll be back home the day after tomorrow.
Tom opened the beer can.
I like Australia.
Give it to him.
I'm going to go.
Tom burned himself.
They stopped.
You're on your own.
The children will go back to school tomorrow.
He didn't go in or out.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Is there anyone there?
There is no reason to be ashamed.
Someone is cheering Tom.
Tom and Mary were baptized last week.
You had better cut your hair.
Who do you think stole your car?
I'm tired of all this good news.
I like to read books.
Woe to you, you whore!
Please call if you have any questions.
You are idiots!
I always stay inside the walls.
You are a problem.
I called.
It's every man for himself.
You are idiots!
I'm going to Boston in October.
Did you eat well?
Stay with me.
Her work is better than mine.
The story repeats itself.
The beer will cover mine.
I'll get you a ticket if you call me sooner.
She ate the coconuts.
The car is good.
Have you been drinking?
Did Tom pray for you a lot?
Are you finished?
Do you think I should do this?
Do you like cheese?
It's a race against time.
I have a fever.
You asked them if they had one.
With a little luck, we have achieved a great success.
I was hurt at their marriage.
Dogs drink water.
Let's play a game.
I didn't think Tom would like Boston.
I don't know what I was expecting.
Please answer.
You are awake.
I am surprised to see you.
Don't forget your money.
Does everyone know this?
Things are getting broken.
Tom doesn't walk much anymore.
Ahmed is a lawyer.
Why are you washing your hands?
I'll take the most expensive one.
We both hated it.
Tom told Mary that he planned to stay in Boston until October.
Listen to this!
Do you know when the movie "Star Trek" will start?
Sami got lost in the forest.
I did nothing.
Stay still and do not move.
Save some of your strength.
Find another one.
I understand your reason.
Sami is busy.
They're making fun of you.
Tom became a monkey.
Tom is a good writer.
Don't hit him with a brick.
He came back at six.
This is a diamond.
We are on the bottom.
Tell him tomorrow.
They helped us.
Does Tom care about you a lot?
I feel old again.
Are you teachers?
I'm afraid we have a problem.
Tom and Mary do this on their own.
Someone opened the door.
Get up!
I want to go swimming tomorrow.
Tom is dancing.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
If you don't want to do it, don't!
He's not there.
Bring me some milk, too.
The moon has already risen.
You fools!
Could you please wait a minute?
He is a fool.
It's your turn!
Take this.
Stop them.
I think you've been misled.
They have a lot of money.
Tell me the truth.
I speak good English.
You went to school yesterday.
Do you have a house in Australia?
Tom went to have sex with Mary.
Tom is a good boxer, isn't he?
Why didn't you read to anyone else?
Someone stole my suitcase.
Someone is watching you.
Tom sent me a letter and a note.
Take this.
I think we're all here.
We won't let you.
Was everyone listening?
Tom is here.
I love French.
I walked.
Birds are flying.
Take a breath!
Your work is very interesting.
Tom called Mary to say goodbye.
Let the water run.
Sami doesn't like Layla to be like this.
Tell me about the Turks in Germany.
Tom started talking.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
I am listening to music.
What did you call your dog?
Our dog is black.
Tom can see.
Who are you talking about?
I have two Canadian friends.
I want to know who read it.
That's right!
It's only a joke.
Tom has been in Australia since October.
Can you find him?
I saw a pig.
Tom was worried.
Do you want to try it?
He died on October 20 in Boston.
Stay here.
I thought someone had died.
I'm going to Boston in July.
I think Tom and Mary are lost.
What did you see in Boston?
We're worried about you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Chicken, please.
Someone took my place.
You must have made a mistake.
Let's take a closer look at this.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
I don't like red meat, so I don't eat it all the time.
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
Did something happen?
It's a second.
I found someone to help me do that.
Just talk to them.
Look behind you.
You are a problem.
We were fighting.
Please call him.
Are you drinking?
Tom understands French well enough, except he has trouble speaking it.
I know the way.
Someone will see us.
Are we finished yet?
There you are!
Are you Ukrainian?
He refused to believe her.
This is Tom's wife.
To the school.
They went to Boston on October 20th.
Why did you come to me?
So what?
I don't eat much fruit.
You are my hero, Sami.
He's not going to get away with it! His time will come!
Tom repeated the word many times.
Are you happy?
Hunger does not make bread.
Who's going to pay for this?
Let's try something.
I never forgot you.
Are you finished?
I want to marry her, but I haven't decided yet.
I'm sure I can handle it.
You are silent.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
You are all invited.
Please go.
Do you want to be alone for the rest of your life?
Open your books!
I speak French.
He is as strong as a horse.
Clean your room.
Who is not accepted?
My mother died.
I like this one. I'll take it.
Stop complaining!
No one has made a comment.
Go to the left!
I don't want you to understand.
I hope you're right.
Don't be afraid of the lights.
We hope you will come in large numbers.
Religion has no future.
He speaks French.
Tom is in Australia.
They married as soon as their wife was ready to marry.
Has anyone died?
Do you have any answers?
Have you read this book?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom wanted to leave Mary.
Stop laughing now.
Hold on to me!
Are you ready?
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Please sit in the corner.
Someone was talking.
Someone else has already done it.
Jim kept himself from getting upset.
Get out of here!
This is a gift for each other.
Tom and Mary danced.
Let me see what you wrote.
It's possible that Tom speaks French.
They are birds.
I love your son.
Ddayxa is in love with Akli.
Somebody has to stop Tom.
Did you attend Tom's singing party?
You have tears in your eyes.
Tom is upset about Mary.
Are you warm?
Please don't die.
They have a lot of money.
Nature created languages that man cannot learn all of.
Sami's car doesn't stop here.
How many Canadians work here?
Please speak a little.
How good!
I can say something.
Hundreds of people eat here every day.
Look behind you.
Do you remember what Tom said?
We are!
Tom seemed to be worried.
I don't want to leave you.
We met on October 20 of last year.
Will you sing?
My father's and grandfather's donkey has been driven to the slaughter!
I heard the fourth man crying.
Keep writing.
Tom came into my house.
Are you Russian?
I've never been fond of biology.
I'm being trained.
Who swam?
I am not a student.
Get out of here!
I like math.
Why does Tom want me to help him?
Is there someone else here?
It's a tough one, Tom: isn't it?
Tom ate in a hurry.
Someone tried to kill you.
What time did Tom leave?
Do you write French?
Tom had no choice but to stay.
What do you want?
I'm glad to be back.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
Have you ever worked with them?
I want you to work with them.
He went to bed early yesterday.
Why does the English say: "foreign language, people call it a dirty word"?
Nothing has changed.
If you need help, give me a call.
Get ready as soon as possible.
Tom called.
It is difficult to choose between a car and a truck.
You are a dog.
Tom cooked potatoes.
The secret is back in the mountains of Kabul.
They are hungry.
He is handsome!
Someone wants to hurt you.
Where were you in October?
What happened?
Tom tried to call himself Mary.
Did anyone call you yesterday?
It's not all right.
"I've got it all figured out", Tom said, "even though I don't really care".
He doesn't have money to borrow.
Are you Chinese?
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
Is it okay if I visit you today?
My parents have just arrived at the station.
Someone stole my suitcase.
Where was your sister?
Are you drinking?
Put it on the floor.
The birds are singing.
Why does Tom want to stop?
Help me to work.
I'm going swimming tomorrow.
Are you forgetting something?
It's already too late.
Have you ever read it?
Is something bothering you?
I heard people speaking French on the bus.
There is no God.
Someone is in my room.
Sami's car is not running.
Help me to get out.
I wonder.
Can you fix this?
Someone was invited.
She was ill.
Nothing will change.
I left Australia four years ago and never returned.
Forget about it!
You are crazy.
I need you here.
There must be someone who will do something.
My life is in your hands.
Do that.
Are you a witch?
We need someone.
Please listen.
Aren't you coming to see me?
Did you enjoy my friend?
There is little milk in the jar.
The more you hurt, the better you are.
I saw someone talking to Tom.
I'll stay home when the next time comes.
I wish you luck.
Is there anyone else you'd like to see?
Well, thank God the green eggs you hatched didn't hatch! They could have been worms!
I don't know Tom very well.
You should go home.
He's not there.
There is one now or there was once.
Children learn by example.
Tom seemed very happy.
Will you go swimming this afternoon?
We arrived in Osaka two days ago.
Please don't go and read what this idiot says!
They were all happy.
I want a lot of money.
Do you know where he was born?
I'm glad to see you too.
What are you reading?
Tom needed someone to make him something to eat.
Tom is ready.
Tom likes to sing.
You two talk.
I'm finished.
He played.
Tom is lucky that Mary isn't there with him.
My job is to do laundry.
This Web site contains a collection of Kabiye lectures and lectures and a catalogue.
I'm working on it.
Tom said he would return to the town where he was born.
You are a hypocrite.
Are you all right?
Did someone hit Tom?
Open the mirror.
What did you do today?
Tom and I talked about many different things.
What are you doing?
He is in trouble.
We're going to play this game.
Why didn't you call me back?
Are they new?
It didn't help.
Eat it!
He wants another cup of coffee.
He put a stick in his pocket.
I'll take Tom up on that.
It looks like I came too early.
Your father will be happy to see you home soon.
You'll find someone who left it here.
There is someone outside.
Someone might hear you.
Is that true?
Tom hopes to see you in October.
I was hoping you would show me how to do that.
Do you speak Latin?
I think there's someone in the front room.
Please come.
Please don't forget to sign the letter.
Are you an artist?
I'm going to cut your tongue.
I will never forgive you.
Why do you want this so much?
Tom always seems to win.
Someone just called me.
You are scared.
Your time has come!
You have offended me.
Mr. West called while you were gone.
I haven't changed. You have.
Do you?
They are angry during the day; they are angry at night. What is it, what is it? It is the door.
Everybody likes sweets.
How is your weekend going so far?
Tom danced.
Let's have a dance.
I worked for about a week in one afternoon.
Where did the money go?
They all came to me!
I need to talk to someone.
I want someone to talk to.
I'm from Japan.
You are beautiful.
I don't think you should do that.
I'm mad at Tom.
Tom helped Mary.
See you again, Tom.
I can't go swimming with you tomorrow.
You're not the only one who's fooled Tom.
Tom made it a point to look at Mary.
You can eat now.
You ran to Tom.
Someone was already here.
What are you working on?
Take these.
This day is over.
Tom has fucked Mary.
Do you want me to read it to you?
Sami likes to do that.
I know we're brave enough for this.
There's something different.
She drinks medicine every hour.
I hope Tom didn't tell me to do that.
I'll never forget that.
She no longer laughs at me.
Tom has spoken.
I can't help Tom today.
I met her once on this street.
I am mad.
So what?
Stop right there.
In fact, he loves her too.
I'm afraid of you.
Mary is a good girl, but she talks a lot.
Did you buy it in Boston?
These phrases are not our own. They are the same as the old ones!
Mary is very beautiful, but not very smart.
I may go to Boston in October.
I hope so.
Bring some milk, too.
Sami traveled through Egypt by car.
I want to buy a house in Australia and stay for a year.
How much do you trust him?
I can't see well.
Hello to all of you!
In our house, the maid said that everyone should do their own laundry.
Take this one.
I have to read the book.
I have a little work to do.
Listen to this!
You can get help from someone.
I already told you that I didn't do that.
Sami never considered himself a Christian.
Two mountains and a valley, and between us a river, which is called the Crifa.
Tom told me a story.
I'm not leaving you, Tom.
Do you think anyone could see me?
Are you finished?
I returned from Boston on October 20.
Neither can you.
Someone is laughing.
Eat this cookie. It will help you sleep.
I'm afraid I'll forget your name.
Tom doesn't care who looks at him.
Mary made a Halloween costume for the children.
I asked Tom to clean the room.
Come on, Tom can't see you're here.
I can't do that for you now.
Here's what you asked for.
Are you lying to me?
Someone heard them.
Are you from Kyoto?
Why didn't you tell me what happened last night?
I can walk.
You are a panda.
I saw someone give Tom a shirt.
Someone is climbing the stairs.
Can they hear?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom did as Mary said.
Try to clean it up.
Maybe we should tell someone.
The spring has come.
I don't know how long it will last.
I missed you.
The time is up.
Your mother is eating the seeds.
It's good to tell the truth.
You've already eaten.
You are being used.
From your heart?
Tom broke it off.
I'll call you this afternoon.
Did Tom really say that he planned to stay in Australia?
Tom visited Australia last summer.
Are you crazy?
He is here to comfort me.
Tom could be in Australia by April.
I like snow.
Are you all such idiots?
Stay on your toes!
Keep your head up!
Are you human?
Remember that.
You're not going to die here.
That's what everyone thinks.
Come on in.
My feet are wet.
Sami asked Layla to make him a present.
Is that not true?
Tell him that.
You'll get used to it.
Someone is following us.
I went too.
You can now consider Layla your fiancée.
Someone is poisoning us.
Are you a monk?
Many countries have laws against smoking.
Will he come back?
The room is for rent.
I might be able to go to Boston in October.
You are in Boston.
What is it anyway?
I was very nervous.
You are tired.
We have until October to finish our work.
Hello, my dear fellow.
I know I can't win.
It will be easier for you.
I'll meet you there at five.
Tom and I were never close friends.
I am going to buy four tickets.
I wanted to be a farmer.
Please come here.
We'd better take a rest.
Someone answered.
Questions will be asked of the reader of the situation, and he must answer them.
I'm a close friend of Tom's.
Should I smoke?
Is he awake?
You are wearing black.
I'm used to the heat.
I don't like to eat alone.
Did you see any of this?
Tom said he wanted to do that.
I came yesterday.
Somebody has to talk.
Are you a witch?
Give them something to eat.
They all speak Romanian.
We'll never do that.
Something is wrong.
They won't tell me how Tom died.
Where are you?
When will you eat lunch?
Why don't you go outside and play?
You are being loved with a passion.
Tom was found dead on October 20th.
Please drink this.
Be careful.
They have guests.
Tom deserves that.
Mary is cheating on Tom.
Tom will come with you when he finishes his work.
Is that your last question?
I am out of work.
I'm a friend of his brother's.
What stage do you work in?
Tom gave us a lot of food.
I don't have a TV.
Sami was fighting with the gym teacher.
Sami is winning.
If you want to eat this, you can.
My father is not at home.
Tom likes to talk about golf.
What is your goal?
They don't know yet.
Tom is a bit of a sniffer.
How good it is!
Come to the house.
Stop singing.
What is your name?
We speak French.
Keep singing!
I'm not doing anything wrong.
Tom doesn't complain about that.
Tom and Mary have a good relationship.
How many pounds did you earn?
The old man put on a suit and his son picked it up.
We're not lost right now.
They have been hurt.
Tom said he'd come tomorrow.
Tom was surprised by his appearance.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
You are a fool!
Tom broke up with Mary.
Tom and Mary have the same idea.
I love their house.
You can always change.
I'd like to go to Australia in October.
Tom is a man of his word.
You showed it to Tom.
Come on over here.
You are so stupid!
I like history.
Everybody is lying.
Stop being so rude!
I assume you like your job.
Don't add the bicycles to the shelves, at least! Damn, that's a waste!
Do you have some water?
Tom died on October 20.
You are smoking.
I like it.
She writes well.
We can't build a house with one roof.
Tom likes to sing.
I've always liked my uncle.
Don't you remember what Tom did to Mary?
I can do it myself.
We are teachers.
There is no one.
No one knows.
I want you to move.
Tom returned to Boston last October.
Don't open the door.
Have you slept?
When did you buy this hat?
Did anyone call you?
I want you to come right away.
Thank you?
I'm really starting to dislike Australia.
Sami's problems are not Layla's.
Have you finished your work?
This will make you stronger.
I want you to try this.
I know you left early.
There was a lion.
You can use this dictionary.
Call them.
It's on!
Why do you want all this?
Sami was there.
Why didn't you go to Boston last summer?
There is someone who is waiting for us.
He likes to walk.
Where is your God now?
I don't know Tom anywhere.
We met for the last time.
Does that make you happy?
Were you surprised to see her?
I killed God.
Tom is bored.
They are inside.
Tom can't help us.
What's the point of a car if you don't drive?
I'll be here on Monday.
Tom is angry with Mary.
Don't leave me alone.
No one will find him.
We all missed you.
I am not interested in religious matters.
You shouldn't eat too many sweets.
You should be careful.
My jeep is long.
Are you new here or not?
Get out of here.
Your smile makes me happy.
You are not allowed to go.
The sun is obscured by clouds.
He is fine.
Tom and I spoke on the phone.
Clean your room!
We were worried about you.
Your friends are waiting for you.
I'm the one who pays all the bills.
Tom knocked on Mary's door three times.
Aren't you going to swim?
Tom went to Australia.
Tom and I both want to go.
When Tom is upset, he eats.
Tom told me that he might go to Boston.
Where will your friends sleep?
You guys are really awesome!
Snow has destroyed all the tourist attractions in all parts of the country.
He used to go to school.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom doesn't remember Mary.
Why didn't you go to Boston last summer?
Have you gone mad?
I did this for you.
I fought with my brother-in-law.
Tom wanted to stop Mary.
This is my opinion, not yours.
Do you know which room the meeting will be in?
I visited Dubrovnik last year.
I think there's someone in the next room.
Australia is not a destination.
Tom and Mary are already engaged.
Tom is a Christian.
What book are you reading?
Tom will forget Mary.
I learned to dance.
I've already told Tom that I want to stay in Australia for three more weeks.
Both Tom and Mary don't want to do that.
I had a few problems getting a taxi.
Can I?
My head is aching.
We're on our way.
I need help now.
Can I talk to you alone?
The trial is over.
The woman you were talking to is my sister.
I could be stopped by someone.
Tom got up.
Tom fell.
You don't usually drink much water.
That's right!
Hold it right there!
The wings fell.
Have I told you?
At night, it was snowing and cold.
Tom disrespects Mary.
Read it to me!
You should learn English.
We all love him.
Can you find her?
Do you believe in ghosts?
Shut up !
I'm Tom's mother.
There is nothing there.
What's in your heart is on your face.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Do you like Germany?
Tom said he liked it very much.
Don't you know that Tom has decided to go to Boston with Mary?
It's been a long time since I smoked.
Guess what!
Please use the tray!
There is no going back.
Sami and Layla are looking at each other.
I'm happy for you.
Somebody has to stop you.
Wait! They are crazy!
How soon will Tom get to Boston?
Children love to play hide and seek.
You have a great book.
Someone might want it.
Some of Hans Christian Andersen's stories have been translated into Kafkaesque.
I don't have any children.
How is it?
Just look at my new car.
Tom is in bad shape.
Tom is Irish.
Do you have a dog?
Don't tell anyone about it.
Change your clothes!
Do you have friends?
Do you remember?
Let the water run off.
Tom has been snowed in.
Let Tom go.
I just spoke with him.
There you go!
You might want to do that with us.
Let's sleep on it.
He lost his dignity.
You should eat breakfast every day.
Listen to this!
Someone is now.
We didn't think that was true.
Ali Deflawen is a famous Kabyle singer.
It is worth it.
I visited Boston that day.
I'll call you today.
You beat Tom.
Don't worry about it.
Do you know where he was born?
Tom is a witty guy.
My mother has been sick for two days.
Don't forget to tell Tom that he should do that.
Are you sick?
Please find it.
Tom doesn't get along with Mary.
They weren't friends.
I like to walk alone.
What time will you eat?
Don't bother. It's easy.
Is there anyone you'd like to help?
What are we waiting for?
Tom has a crush.
Your computer won't start!
One of you should speak.
Is something troubling you?
Tom has a black car.
Have you used them?
Someone is watching you.
Fish, please.
I want to know what you like to eat.
It was a beautiful day.
Sami wants to stay at home.
Are you alone?
No one is dead.
Give me your eye!
Have you had dinner or not?
Where did he go?
Tom was hired in October.
Tom married a girl who was older than he was.
"So you believe him?" "It is true!"
Tom seems to be rich.
The one who doesn't speak agrees.
You've lived through it twice.
You are right.
Please get up.
Tell the truth.
You are crazy.
It's good.
You had better cut your hair.
Give your money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.
This is obviously art.
I haven't forgotten about you.
I am a human being.
Have you seen the new movie?
They're all dead.
Say it another way.
Where is the pen?
I don't eat fruit.
What will you eat tomorrow?
When is Tom coming back from Boston?
You're too close to me.
Give it to whoever you want.
Tom took Mary's place.
She grabbed my hand.
Why can't we play tennis today?
Where did you study?
He was very upset.
You shouldn't work.
Did you arrest Tom?
I want to eat here tonight.
Have you seen the star?
Do you speak French?
Your older sister will meet you.
Two beers, please.
You're better than Tom.
Tom threw the apple at me.
The little cat is sitting on the top of the stack.
I am a foreigner.
Someone has poisoned us.
Everything is where it expects to be.
From the heart?
Do you have daughters?
He is a child who follows the advice of his parents and teachers.
Hello again!
You are so funny.
Are you running away from me?
If you want something, buy it.
Switzerland is a country of railways.
Arabic is not my language, I am a Kabyle.
Are you crazy?
October was difficult.
Have you read this?
Probably not.
There's someone inside.
I don't care if you kiss Tom or not.
I want a maple.
Open the door.
Tom and I went to Boston to see Mary.
Tom is your father.
Tom was the first to pass the test.
This time it's not the same.
I'm sorry about that.
It's snowing.
He went to visit her when she lived in London.
Someone is busy right now.
I want you to work with them.
October is a busy month.
We all miss you.
I have to study.
Take Tom home.
I'll eat here.
The truth is a lie.
I have eaten.
I didn't stay in Boston for long.
What do you want from us?
Tom wants to marry Mary.
Tom can't drive.
Sami knows where she lives.
Why does Tom need my help?
I shouldn't have kissed Tom.
You didn't help me.
I'm not eating at home tonight.
Look at that.
You are happy.
You're not in love with Boston yet, are you?
He picked up a bagel and went straight to the market.
Hold this.
How long will you be gone for?
Sami is tired of Layla.
Why are you crying?
You guys! I thought you were going to wear a bra! I didn't see that!
The lights went out, and people went home.
They are all hungry.
A fire broke out at night.
Why are you sitting alone?
I like old women.
You should hurry.
Get your hands off me.
We didn't leave you.
Swimming is good for your health.
France is a republic.
You've embarrassed yourself.
Just wait here.
Tom is a different person.
Mary built it.
Tom and Mary are smiling.
Someone is knocking at the door.
Sami has a habit of eating at a restaurant.
You'll have a little sister.
Tom is very shy.
She lost everything she had.
After you.
Who's on the other side?
Tom is arrested.
Tom said he knew who did it.
Tom is rich.
I don't talk about this with her.
Who knows what it is.
What is your friend's name?
I told you it would work.
You are crazy.
You are blinded by love.
Soccer is a crime in this country.
I'm not going.
I'm washing my clothes.
It's heating up fast!
See you later, Ian.
Do not underestimate your worth.
Stop them.
If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Be careful!
Are you blind?
Eat all you want.
How long are we going to wait?
Life is beautiful.
The wind is blowing.
He is beautiful!
Why didn't you take him home?
Tom wants to be.
This dictionary is not correct at all.
Did you find anything?
You have come to me in a state of grace.
Did you blame Tom?
Don't cry out.
You seem to be bothering me a lot.
They're all outside.
What do you want from Tom?
Why do you want all these things?
Did you see that I was talking like that?
If Tom can't do it, no one can.
I really need to eat something.
I've been through a lot in my life.
Are you hungry?
They have a problem.
Put your clothes on!
Tom is reaching.
Since when has Tom been learning French?
I play the guitar.
Why not?
I'll ask Tom to do that.
Is there anything you can understand?
I realized that Tom really loves me.
I like to sleep.
Tom and Mary have two ideas.
We all hate you.
Do you know Tom's password?
You can take Tom home this evening.
We know that you didn't kill Tom.
Sami was in Tahiti.
Try to convince Tom to do that.
Tell me who you are!
No one knows why.
Is that love?
Are you still alive?
Tom could see Mary.
One, two, three, go!
Are you serious?
I heard someone talking.
Tom thought I was Mary.
What boy?
We don't have a book.
How many eggs do you eat a week?
Tell Tom what you want.
Someone was talking.
Have you read this?
I'm waiting for a call this morning.
What does all this mean?
You must follow the rules.
Do good to those who hate you.
What do you want?
Stop your whining.
It's really bad.
I need someone to talk to.
Say 'ahhh' to yourself.
I don't like Tom.
Let me see what you wrote.
You are laughing.
He read the paper with a pen.
We need more people.
You are lucky to have come here.
Is there anyone you'd like to see?
Be with me.
You are food.
You have plenty of time.
But I just said that: the old days were very bad.
Are you Canadian?
I hope to do it again.
There is no garage in Tom's house.
Someone should talk.
I respect you.
October 20th is a busy day.
Then it started to rain heavily.
Tom drove faster than Mary.
Write your name.
Someone was killed.
No one said anything.
You can return your money if you want.
I don't agree with you on this.
It's our car.
I trust you.
Do as you please.
I'm tired of watching TV.
You never ate the cookie.
Could you help us again?
They are all waiting.
Our success is tied to your difficulties.
Which tooth hurt you?
Please come today if you're bored.
Tom got up.
How many cookies did you eat?
Can I see the list, please?
Be careful!
Tom tried to save Mary.
Tom regretted doing it.
You need someone like me.
Tom is your father.
I don't think I like this.
Are you mad?
Take it all off.
Did Tom drink?
Sami saw Layla leave Walmart.
What are you going to do with this?
I didn't read it right.
Who was invited to the party?
Tom kissed Mary.
They are angry.
I don't understand how this could happen.
The pen you're holding is now mine.
What did you say to him?
Tom and I are going to be neighbors.
How long will you stay in Boston?
Tom loves French.
He stayed at home.
Leave that to you.
What can you tell me?
A year of snow is a year of wheat.
Snow is cold, but beautiful.
Hold on there!
I need to find a way out of here.
He went to the bar to get some beers.
I think Tom is much older than I am.
Read for yourself.
Do we have one?
Please be quiet.
Sami believed his mother.
I can't do otherwise.
Hokkaido is located in northern Japan.
Tom was born in Australia.
They are waiting.
Did you hear what they said?
I am with child.
Who told you that Tom would be here?
Can you drive us?
How will they see?
He looked at me.
Give it to Tom!
Are you all right?
You look happy.
It seems I came too early.
I never tried to drive a car.
Tom ran outside to see what had happened.
Tom is the kind of man I like.
Who is the wise man?
Tom stopped at a rest stop.
They celebrate Halloween in October.
Why aren't you doing anything?
Tom loaned me a lot of money.
Are you new?
Get in there!
The cat ran away.
You work a lot.
Someone came to our house.
My husband is a good man.
Tom is motivated.
Tom said he had never heard Mary sing.
I think I'm asleep.
Tom is going to Boston in October.
I could never love him as much as I love you.
Who speaks French?
Do you have a house in Australia?
Leave them.
Tom is sniffing.
Tom was let go of the shout.
I like to swim.
Someone is sleeping on this bed.
You have a letter and a letter.
Mary and Tom want to buy a house.
Tom told me he knew someone who had given Mary a hat.
I like apples.
I went to a Halloween party.
What happened?
We were wrong.
I believe you.
I'm here in Australia, alone.
I know everything.
It's too cold.
Have you read it?
He is dead.
Tom came home three hours later.
Tom let his dogs go free.
I love you very much.
Come home early!
Tom went into the kitchen.
You are dead.
Obviously they didn't read us.
The apples are big.
I have a sore throat.
They won.
It's easy to use.
You have no heart.
Stay where you are.
You are a coward!
Someone has to do it.
If I thought yes, I would tell you.
I read a poem, would you like me to read it to you?
Can you help me, please?
Did she use them?
Thank you for telling us that.
This is my brother's.
They are all dead.
Is that Tom?
Learn it!
We need a car.
I don't eat fish unless it's fresh.
Call them.
Please just tell me what's going on.
Tom is nervous.
When I come home from my prayer service, I like to have a glass of wine before going to bed.
She built it.
I will turn thirty in October.
Use your head.
Tom is really heavy.
Tom stood up.
It's all right!
It's time to go home.
Come here!
Sami bought two cookies on Amazon.
It is!
Do you work?
Does Tom work for you?
The words "head" and "neck" come from the same root as "neck": the tip of a leg that can be broken.
The girls are crazy.
You are all crazy.
Sami is very happy.
Tom is playing French.
Stop the smoking.
Can any of us speak Spanish?
She won't eat that.
Tom didn't see her.
Call me at that.
Which of your brothers is the oldest?
This has happened a few times.
Why did you study?
I keep on singing.
Everyone knows that it's Tom's car.
Do you smoke?
His face has changed a lot.
You're out of your mind to keep working in a place like this.
I see.
Tom is crying.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
Tom changed jobs.
It is a bird.
There is no hope for his recovery.
The light is winning.
Stop the whining!
I'm here as a friend.
You had better not do that while Tom is here.
These girls both love you.
Tom and I have not known each other for long.
I saw one give Tom a ring.
Can you give Tom a drink?
I've been seeing Tom again today.
There is nothing better than love.
I'll be in Boston by October 20th.
Where did you learn Italian?
Let me try something.
I'll go with you.
Stop crying.
Have you seen your sister?
Layla wiped her face.
Look at that!
Tell them the truth.
We won.
I'm not washing your car.
I met a man whose father knew Tom.
I'm not here to hurt you.
You were stolen.
Sami ran across the hall.
The shadow.
Someone opened the door.
I thought we were friends.
Are you ready?
I want to eat Chinese food for dinner.
Clean your room!
You have to follow the rules.
She is a Kabyle.
We have guests this evening.
Please help me!
The church is affiliated with the Azeri Protestant Church, a secret organization of Protestant churches.
You are a pest in the kitchen.
Somebody is watching Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
You don't eat too fast, do you?
Life is going on.
Was Adam really a scientist?
I love you just the way you are.
Tom has been talking about you all day.
No one else went there.
They left.
You must eat something.
There you go.
I asked Mr. Smith.
Your sister is the smartest of all the other students.
You can't go in there with that.
It looks good.
The boy stole money from his mother's purse.
Don't you know that Tom and Mary are still having fun?
Tom attacked Mary.
What time was it when you got here?
Look to your side.
You are reading.
Please help us.
Which one of you?
I feel guilty about it.
Tom didn't know Mary loved him.
Boys and girls play together.
Your eyes are watery.
No one knows.
I'm listening to music.
Tom is a jerk.
Tom didn't ask Mary to help him.
He was jailed for writing the book.
I know your language.
Art is long, life is short.
Tom is ready to work.
I don't want to talk about my son.
Tom and I got married young.
Tom is pissed.
I haven't seen Tom since the Halloween party.
She forgot.
We can do something.
He ran.
Tom is looking at Mary.
Sami got up to pray at dawn.
Who would be Tom's replacement if he wasn't?
Someone wants to send a letter.
Tom died of cancer in October.
You seem to know how to do this.
They are the same age.
No one told me you'd be so cold.
You didn't help me.
This is Rabah back.
I believe him.
October 20 was a hot day.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
He thinks like a child.
Tom is a very young boy.
Why did you go there?
Where are your dogs?
Tom was suspicious.
What are you doing this weekend?
Half of your work is done.
All the violence comes from religion.
Tom tried to keep his eyes open.
You are full of shit.
Our dog is black.
Your mother eats slowly.
Mary is a widow.
Show me something I don't know.
Are you well?
They love their Kabyle culture.
I know you'll find a way to do that.
Someone is following us.
I know who he is.
The rain is outside.
He really hurt my heart.
I want someone else.
Clean the room.
You are hiding something.
Are you here?
Didn't you know that Tom was planning to go to Boston with Mary?
Tom wanted to scare Mary.
Unity is good when there is agreement.
You're crazy, that's what I should do!
It's snowing.
Someone is wearing his hat.
The snow covered the land with clouds.
Someone has been pretending.
Tom can do whatever he wants.
Please don't be mad.
Someone stole my car.
Are you tall?
You are the love of my life.
If the bread is cold, we can make olive oil.
Aren't you tired?
Does everyone like music?
I was in Boston on October 20th of last year.
Run with a speed.
I'm not your slave.
Why are you sitting alone?
No one answered.
It is true.
I turned to the right.
Who knows why Tom turned down the job.
I don't need your work.
Naomi has been very happy since she won the prize.
Tom wasn't going to kiss Mary.
See you at dinner.
Tom did a great job for us.
I wonder if he loves me.
The Mayans like to eat beef.
Could you pass me a tea, please?
Tom is drunk.
How are you, Tom?
He's fine. No one is wrong.

I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
Tom could do that, couldn't he?
Leave it to us.
I wish I had married Tom last October.
What is your father's profession?
Sami saw him again.
I want to sit in the middle.
So, is Tom a good actor?
I'm not tall.
You should be careful when crossing the street.
Say it again.
Today is a good day.
At first my father didn't care.
May I ask a question that is not relevant?
Your heart belongs to you.
I'll tell you how to do it.
Did you see the movie or not?
World peace.
I would like someone to help me do this.
What a mess!
Tom is going to Boston next month.
Have you ever been to New York?
That's not going to happen.
Tom said I couldn't come in.
Do you want white or red wine?
One of them forgets her umbrella.
Can you stop the car?
Are you at home?
Don't look back at my work.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Try this.
The cat is a cat.
I've got you.
Eat all you want.
Tom is tired.
I was in Boston when it happened.
Did you read that?
You're after Tom.
You'd think it was snow.
Let it be.
I think I'd like to do that.
You and I love games.
I wanted to marry Tom.
Men like to eat.
I haven't been there since October.
How did you find me?
Mr. Jones is here to see you.
I like to learn languages.
Everyone doesn't know how to pronounce Tom's name.
She lied.
I think you did that without paying attention.
Could you pass the salt, please?
It's Monday.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice were married on October 20, 2013.
Sami destroyed Layla's house.
You too.
Talk to someone.
Sami had been here for five or six months.
Are you crazy?
Tom and I had lunch.
Someone broke my watch.
Confess again.
Clean up your room.
They take care of others every day.
Tom came to believe Mary.
She is dead.
They never said anything about that.
Tom and Mary hoped no one had seen them.
"Tom told you"... "I'm not interested in what Tom said".
You got up early.
Are you from Tibet?
I know that Tom isn't dead.
Tom wants to buy books.
You are talking.
For what?
Tom asked Mary to smile.
I was reading a book.
Tell me that you cheated on me.
I want you to come right away.
Dry your tears.
Rima is a student.
How do you breathe?
Thank you for your hospitality.
I saw one.
Why are you saying that?
We are talking about Tom.
Can I have it?
There is no hope left.
I know you're brave for this.
The sounds of gunfire heard at night in the houses where people are being robbed or murdered are common.
Tom might have seen something.
She drinks coffee with milk.
I hope no one saw you.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
I know you're going to Boston in July.
I'm putting on my clothes.
Why didn't he reply to me?
I love you very much.
Are you sure you know what needs to be done?
Tom is fluent in French.
Tom sat and cried.
Can you come?
There's someone there.
How many pounds did you add?
How stupid is that?
Please stop.
A glass of red wine, please.
The lion said, "Oh, the other lions have recognized us!"
Someone was wrong.
Tom hasn't left Australia.
We know that you didn't kill Tom.
Tom and Mary left about an hour ago.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
Speak up!
Tom understood.
When will you come?
The milk is fermented.
He is good!
Tom went to Boston to look for work.
You have to help your father.
It took two years of waiting.
I'm glad to see you, too.
Why did you let us down, Tom?
Do Tom and Mary speak French?
Why did you kill all those dogs?
Come after me.
I learned French.
These guys are going to be tough.
You are gone.
Hurry up!
They are dead!
I'm sorry, where are you from?
What do you feed your dog?
The character of "Isabelle Adjani" is a Kabyle.
Tom played in the band.
I hope Tom didn't tell me to do that.
Which one do you like best?
Look at this!
Tom met many other artists while in Boston.
Tom fixed his car this morning.
I went to a Halloween party dressed as a vampire.
He stayed here for a long time.
Leave Tom alone.
Tom wants to call Mary.
I can't see her.
I see the world differently now.
I'm seeing a book.
Have you read this?
I don't understand it that well.
The rain is already coming.
I don't have a younger sister.
Tom and Mary understood why they were there.
You have two faces.
I studied history of agriculture.
Get out of there!
Maybe we should tell someone.
He never felt sorry for the man he had hurt.
I'll write to you when I'm ready.
I got bored.
We know you lied to Tom.
You'll regret this.
He did well.
How many lakes are there in India?
Tom couldn't find Mary.
Tom writes smartly.
You hit me!
Tom kissed me.
Did anyone see anything?
Have faith in me!
Don't be scared of it.
Can you help me translate this into French?
I want to move with you.
We stayed together until the next election.
Sami called his mother.
Someone is trying to kill me.
Tom started to screw Mary.
Someone stole my wallet.
Did he say anything to you about this?
Can you help me translate this into French?
Tom is starting.
I'll go swimming with you.
Please speak slowly.
Please come in!
Tom wanted to kiss Mary.
Tom has sent you something.
We apologized.
I'm determined to do better this way.
I was studying French when you came yesterday.
You just left.
She said.
You don't seem to be together.
He really broke your heart.
There is no internet connection.
This car is beautiful.
You may enter.
Tom offered to help.
Let me in.
Someone has died.
Is that all you and the girls are?
Give it to me.
I need to talk to someone.
I have something to give you.
Someone ate their poison.
Are you ready?
Tom lost them.
Don't come into my room without permission.
I'm glad to have your letter.
I'll show you how it's done.
If you want to go, go now!
Thank you, I've only just understood.
They are blue, Tom.
You are not Japanese.
The older she gets, the younger she gets.
Let's have some fun.
Do not wait.
He was a good boy.
Choose your favorite flowers.
Please help me.
Someday, whoever wins will win.
Are you crying?
Is this new?
If Mary were here, she would help us.
Speak up.
Where did I leave my mother and her mother?
Have a good day!
Tom doesn't seem to be happy.
Are you short?
I can't do what I want.
I can't protect you.
Sami's friend died.
Why did you buy it?
Please pass me the sugar.
Suck the milk.
We were waiting for them.
We wrote them.
Keep moving.
I need someone to talk to.
You are walking fast!
We caught three pigeons.
He is afraid of him.
Tom swore to Mary that he didn't steal her purse.
I miss you so much.
Tom never told Mary how sorry he was.
Do not speak!
Tom is in seventh heaven.
I've been done a lot of things.
You'd better not spend a lot of money on this.
Get out of here!
Where is the safe?
I'll tell them about this.
Tom knew that Mary was following him.
Hurry up!
This is not Australia.
We have yet to find a satisfactory solution.
I don't understand the train.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Please.
He is gone.
Keep working.
You have betrayed your country.
Sami ate Layla's cookies.
Are you hurt?
I have to talk to someone.
They were eating.
Tom wasn't doing anything.
No one is wrong.
Follow my advice.
They all sang.
What else do you want to buy?
I'm not your friend.
I think Tom is ready.
You have to smoke.
Tom really loves you.
They want you dead.
I'm a Muslim who believes in Jesus. Is there a problem?
You should always have a dictionary on hand.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
Be willing to help.
I can run.
I know who this book belongs to.
There are some spots on the top of the table.
Have you decided what to give Tom for his birthday?
You look good.
He walks slowly.
Are there any questions?
I told them not to tell you.
Something is smelling.
Follow your sister's path.
I'm very tired.
Stop looking!
Tom's room is always empty.
You are singing!
You've turned my mind!
I will be in Australia until October 20th.
Listen to this!
We can work on that right now.
Be ready in a hurry.
I have to eat now.
I won't break anything.
Tom gave me some books.
I'm sorry that you lost.
The wind will blow.
Show them off.
Someone is waiting for you.
It's a pity you can't come.
Give it to him.
Tom loaned Mary three hundred dollars.
I don't know who can swim and who can't.
They left the day before yesterday.
Tom said he never heard Mary sing.
Nothing has changed.
Let him live as he wants.
Please let me borrow your car.
I did that.
Please answer if you can.
How did they find out about Tom?
My uncle visited me every three days.
Tom didn't kiss Mary.
Try to move it.
Do we really have to go back?
Clear the way.
Another lonely day.
Tom must have bought flowers for Mary.
Tom followed Mary to the house.
Tom will be buried on October 20.
Tom won't let you go.
Everything is wrong with him.
Why do people go to the movies?
Why won't you listen to me?
I bought an old car.
He is wounded!
No one understands me.
Shut up Tom!
Are you an artist?
Are you ashamed?
Tom has come.
Tom woke up from his dream.
Nothing happened to the pig.
Go where no one knows you.
I don't like big dogs.
Is there someone you want to see?
I don't use a computer every day.
Tom can cook.
Play the game!
I want to be a writer.
Pull him over!
Tom tried to save Mary from death.
Tom is a nerd.
If you don't eat too much, you're fine.
I am a Kabyle.
There is someone in the house.
I am not a student.
Tom said that he wanted to quit smoking.
Someone is coming right now.
Tom didn't see him.
What are you waiting for?
I'd like someone to help me do this.
Tom and his wife are angry.
A smile is an honor.
I like to watch westerns.
I can't see straight.
He'll come to your place tomorrow.
Tom is sick.
Are you in Australia?
I hope no one noticed you.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Who?
Shut up!
Tom always speaks French with me.
I don't have the courage to write it.
I know some of those boys.
Is it okay if I take a break?
He didn't have to see her.
I don't agree with you on this.
Please smile!
I'll pay for it.
Tom tried to swim across the creek.
Are you kidding me?
Go on home.
He needs a lot of courage to become a teacher!
Why did they send you back?
What do they call you?
I'm going to do that today.
All my problems are over.
I sent her home.
I like it.
I heard someone whistling.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
Where is Wagadugu?
Someone was watching you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Have you told Tom?
How are you?
Why don't you call Tom to remind him?
Somebody told Tom something.
Please tell Tom to come in.
They all love you.
How can I ask you a question that isn't answered?
According to science, man evolved from monkeys.
Tom is not a credible witness.
Don't stop me when I'm talking.
Tom was being groomed by Mary.
Do something!
I was given a free copy of the books.
She went to swim in the river.
I think you should read this book.
Why are you afraid?
These are new.
Can someone help me?
Someone is watching us.
You're crazy to keep working in a place like this.
Tom isn't dead yet.
So, we'll build a mountain by a mountain.
Someone called Tom.
Who are the neighbors?
I'm going to eat now.
Tom bought me a ticket.
Tom is angry.
Show me the one that's different.
It is closed.
Why didn't you tell me you were going to Australia?
You are talking.
Are they safe?
I walked with my dog.
I saw someone kissing Tom.
Maybe we should tell someone.
Young people nowadays are very difficult.
Please don't take it out on me.
Someone called you.
He doesn't know what to do now.
Do you have any questions?
It's raining!
Please stand aside.
Shut up!
What is this?
I should have understood.
She won't eat it.
What do you feed your dog?
Tom has until October 20th to make up his mind.
I was fired from my job.
Take me home.
You should see his movie.
Everybody is silent.
It smells.
Tom is the tallest in his class.
How are they all?
She was stunned.
You must have done that with us.
Eat your breakfast, John!
Tom doesn't always tell the truth.
I'll bet you're just trying to get my attention.
I left Australia on the twelfth of October.
I wonder how anyone could want to get involved in this.
Tom said that he wanted to be buried in Australia.
You're lucky to keep working in a place like this.
They stole my money.
I know Tom is very busy.
They are sleeping.
What can you give us, Tom?
I remember doing it again.
I thought he would come.
No one can swim.
I look after her.
Have some water.
Can anyone help?
You heard me very well.
Well, son, the rest is history.
I wonder if Tom has a heart condition.
Dad still wants Tom to go out with you.
Tom said he didn't think he'd regret it.
I like it a lot.
You were right to trash my house.
I wish I was asleep as I am.
Give me work while I'm hot.
What did you think of his new novel?
I could be stopped.
Are you Russian?
Tom said he'd never eaten Thai food.
Tom said he had a day off.
Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher.
Do you know how to laugh?
You are all crazy.
When did Tom come?
What did you put inside the box?
He became very famous.
I called security.
You danced.
Tom hurt Mary.
This house is small.
We're not ready to ask yet.
Get out of here!
Whose idea was that?
I fed him the dog.
Drink your coffee.
I hope you understand.
How did you find me?
I saw that the problem would be solved.
"Where will our Kabyle be?" "It will be in the right place!"
The phones are on.
I have nothing to fear.
I'm not trying to stop you.
I want to know everything you did.
Did something happen?
I feel something.
Do you have a pet?
Could you speak more slowly, please?
Someone is trying to hurt you.
Hold him down!
Are you here?
Tom is a liar.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia right now.
I didn't dare to look at it!
Tom said he wasn't alone.
This water is boiling.
Thank you!
Someone is guarding Tom.
I like the light of the bottles.
Do you like Italian?
Have you found your letters?
I don't like you anymore.
I saw a dog.
What do they call this fruit?
What's my problem?
I'll never forget that.
I just hope no one saw you come here.
I'm sorry about that.
When did you start doing this?
I'm going to stop working.
It is enough.
I have to learn French, Tom said.
He couldn't finish his dinner.
You went back.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't happy.
Tom wrote a letter to Mary.
I just can't.
Ahmed is a genius.
A cup of tea, please.
Do you speak French?
Let me know if anything changes.
Get away from me!
Have you seen Tom yet?
They're going to play football tomorrow.
This is John.
How strong you are!
Tom is a coward.
Move to the front!
Something happened that I didn't know about.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Monday is closer to Sunday.
You will be in Boston in October.
Did you see that smile?
Will you remember me?
You are right.
You speak fast.
Are you hungry?
Did anyone else come?
This is here.
Jaffar was drunk yesterday.
I'm tired of my work.
Tom likes the outdoors.
There is someone who is being watched.
You never told me you knew Tom.
Monday comes after Sunday.
I'm not your maid!
Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
What's your name on Skype?
Someone broke this box.
Play the game!
Get on your feet!
Food in this restaurant is not cheap.
I'm almost ready.
I hate to fail.
Shut it down.
You are sick.
You should write a novel.
The one who eats is always wrong.
I understood.
Who went with you?
They move around and get to know each other.
The watch is finished.
Help me with this.
You had better cut your hair.
Tom bought coke for Mary.
We have filed for divorce.
You are sure you know what needs to be done.
I'm currently staying in Australia.
Tom went home with Mary.
The bottom of my pants is too tight.
You are lying.
Tom and Mary will be back soon.
I wonder if I like you very much or if I just love you.
The whole city will be covered in snow.
Give me all the money.
We found him alive.
Where were you?
The one who touched my eye, blinded me.
Someone wants to send a letter.
Did you see his face?
I want you to sign up.
You will find someone.
You are a cup.
I was preparing them.
Did you blame Tom?
You can drive if you want.
They are having fun.
Read it!
You found me awake.
Somebody has to do something.
I want to eat something.
Tom used to drink beer.
It smells bad.
Did you eat anything last night?
Don't leave your stuff here.
Tom needs someone to help him.
You came back.
Tom said he had never eaten sushi.
Someone is singing.
Will she come?
Someone must have stopped us.
They've been watching you.
I will learn Esperanto in my country.
Someone could see us.
I don't miss Boston at all.
Are these books yours or mine?
Tom didn't think Mary loved him at all.
That's what you need.
Give me my keys.
Get off of me!
Take these.
Tom just texted me.
Look carefully.
You can go home now.
Follow him behind me.
I forgot to eat my dog.
You're a pain in the ass in the kitchen.
It's scary!
I live in Yerevan.
There's nothing here.
I know you'll find a way to do it.
Tom may be a bit of a loser.
Don't be afraid to laugh.
They accepted.
Stop crying!
Tom is waiting for someone.
Put on your clothes!
My hand is hurting.
Do you go swimming in the winter?
Tom is afraid that Mary will forget.
Please don't forget to say hello to your family.
You are lying.
They shook hands.
Tom misses Mary.
They died.
You can read this book.
I asked him to come with me, and he agreed.
Are you afraid?
I let Tom kiss me.
Let the water flow.
Are you Americans?
You don't know what true love is.
They're making fun of you.
Go to the cemetery.
Get up on your feet!
Tom plays the guitar.
The smell of insects is both pleasant and frightening.
Someone is listening.
Have you seen the new movie?
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
Away with you!
Who are these dogs?
Could someone catch us?
That's all it is.
Are you lying?
Tom is thinking.
Reading improves the comprehension.
You should probably stop.
Have you ever been to New York?
Tom said that Mary looked scared.
We got caught.
What do you think, will it be good for snow?
Get some help.
Is there anything that can't be done?
Tom isn't as smart as his brother.
Look behind you.
Open the door with this key.
I didn't leave her alone.
What is a computer?
Why do you want a horse?
Is he known?
Did you know Mary before she joined the party?
Be careful!
Someone broke this box.
No one has gone yet.
Tom and I are just friends.
Are you lying to me?
A book cannot read itself.
Please teach me how to sing in French.
I already told Tom I didn't want to do that.
Tom and I will always be friends.
Is French a language?
She is hungry.
How salty!
Would you like some food?
I really love you.
Leave the rest of you alone.
Try to get him to stop.
You and I are one.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
I'm tired of reading.
How many books have you read?
This is the story.
Tom is angry.
How long?
Someone is playing.
Open your mouth!
How are you spending your time in Boston?
Where did you leave them?
Watch the television.
Do you need food?
Make yourself at home.
Tom can't remember where he hid the card.
You're both ashamed.
The forest was quiet.
I can eat when I want.
Tom and I were born on the same day.
Mr. Tanaka came while you were away.
Are your parents still alive?
I just can't sleep.
It's cold.
They're all happy.
We are talking.
Tom has cheated on Mary.
I made a big mistake.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Give me the head of the cow.
He knows dozens of languages.
Sami played this game.
Tom built a big house.
Tom thought he was the best.
I've always been proud of you.
I can't speak another language.
Tom has never had a problem with anyone.
Hello to everyone.
Tom didn't know that Mary had done it.
He is a boy with many dreams.
Tom is angry.
He didn't just grunt.
Why weren't you paying attention?
The whole class laughed at Tom's new shirt.
Sami doesn't know how to get along with people.
Call me when you get there.
Why didn't Tom ask someone else to do that?
I have plenty of food.
Snow brings wheat.
Tom has changed.
Tom's face is yellow.
You're not ready yet.
Take care of yourselves!
The day is coming soon.
Holidays
Your cake is sour.
How have you been spending your weekend so far?
Have another.
Tom saw Mary at the Halloween party.
Get up off your feet!
I want to see your sister.
Tom is married to Mary.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Tom yelled at me.
Tom fled to Australia.
Can you give me some money?
You're a good writer.
The diamonds.
Julia is singing.
This is a guide!
Is there anyone there?
Sami was walking in a small town.
Tom didn't do what he wanted to do.
Someone saw you.
You are very different from us.
He loves me!
Get back there!
A man without a plan will not grow.
Mr. Sakaki is here to see you.
Tom then began to read.
Is there a problem?
Tom was against it.
Do you watch TV every day?
I like to joke.
Please be careful.
Can you come?
I'll do everything I can for you.
Let each man take care of his own health and well -being, not merely his own. If anyone wants to be rich, he should be poor himself. If anyone wants to be honored in a special way, he should be free from all charges.
I'm reading the book.
I need you to do something.
Will you excuse me?
Tom said he had to borrow money.
Stop now.
Tom told me I was beautiful.
You are at home.
You lost them.
So who is it?
May I have some coffee, please?
Please come back.
This room can hold 5,000 people.
The stone axe cut off the road.
Tom's father abandoned his family.
Did someone call you?
Is it raining today?
I didn't want to wait for this.
I am lucky to have met you here.
Tom won't go to Boston until October.
Have you already done it?
Are you ready?
I already told Tom that he should do it.
May I say something?
We may need them.
Which is the truth?
Someone else has come.
Are you making him a sandwich?
What do you think you're seeing?
Can anyone help me?
I gave him the little money I had.
Give me a hand!
Someone is watching Tom.
A goat is the poor man's cow.
Do you like Italian?
It would be nice to see you again.
Go for a walk.
Look again!
One is better than the other, as the old saying goes.
There was a fire in the house.
I told Tom why I wasn't there.
Tom looked at Mary.
Today is the second day of the sessions in Tuber.
Tom said he could help us do that.
Which one do you like?
When did you arrive in Boston?
Did Tom say why he didn't come to the wedding?
I came alone.
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
Are they new?
You are my only hope.
Do not move!
Watch yourselves.
Tom said that Mary wasn't very smart.
French bread is delicious.
I never needed this kind of money.
They waited.
You should talk to Tom.
Tom turned to the garden and looked around.
Tom nodded to say he wasn't coming.
I need to talk to someone.
Are you kidding me?
You're too busy to keep working in a place like this.
Are you Russian?
I will return to Boston on October 20.
You're out of my league.
I feel happy.
When did she get her car?
You are all right.
Tom is excited.
What's your friend's name?
How did Tom get to Australia?
How did you sell the film "The Others"?
Tom and I were on the same train.
I like my Kabyle culture.
Is there one?
Can you also speak French?
You are hungry.
Tom is a good writer.
Tom plays the piano every day.
Tom doesn't need to go to school today.
Because you're a girl.
Someone else was already there.
Sicily is an island.
People change.
I don't want to leave you.
Can you try here?
You can use this dictionary.
I like coffee.
Tom likes to play tennis, but Mary doesn't.
Tom went to Australia.
Tom is a man of character.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
Come and dance!
I'm afraid we'll have to leave if we want to be home before dark.
They're still waiting for us.
Keep your head down!
We all miss you.
You can go home now.
Thank God.
This is my opinion, not yours.
I'll get you out of there.
Australia is for everyone.
Not all candles have a light bulb, so they can turn on the light after dark.
Someone is eating.
I thought someone had died.
What is a leaf?
No one ever listens to me.
Who made a mistake?
Tom has a crush on Mary.
Do you want to lose weight?
Tom danced.
He begged me to arrive early.
You are so cute!
This took me many hours.
It must be over by now.
Stop the noise!
Stay here until Tom comes.
Tom is shy.
Please don't leave me here with Tom.
You don't know who we'll meet.
Remember what Tom said?
Throw me your papers!
How long did you stay in Boston?
There's someone outside.
I don't think I like Boston.
My driver is very nice.
I told Tom why I was in the hospital.
Go and get some rest.
I like to race.
Someone is waiting.
I'm glad to see you again.
Naomi moved her bag from one side to the other.
You are getting close.
I'm a friend of her brother's.
Tom didn't want to help Mary.
Why did you come to me?
Hello to all of you.
I'm not different.
Is this your book?
We are happy.
They lied.

Where is your grandson?

So that's it!
Try to find a cure.
Let me go!

Is the engine running?
He's here to kill me.

Is it over or not?
Who went with you?
Tom wants to make a lot of money fast.
Nothing has changed.
I have to meet Tom.
You have to.
I'll take Tom's place.
Is that paper?
I am at home.
You can go home now, too.
Where are your fingers?
I really didn't expect what Tom said I would.
Today, it's all about the money!
Each one pays for itself.
You read it again.
Someone has to pay.
Keep writing.
I don't need your pity.
Have the children eaten yet?
He is crying.
Why do you need a sword?
Tom is currently living in Australia.
I am a nurse by profession.
It's the wind.
Tom and Mary are having fun.
Tom is asleep.
How can you be proud of a man like that?
You're the one who's been spying on me.

Are herbs and spices banned in Australia?
Someone will pay.
Tom forgot how beautiful she was.
We need to find someone who can help us.
He came from the highway.
He is tired.
She likes to fish.
Someone is staring at Tom.
I'm not ready to grow up.
We were both tired.
Spring is here.
Is there someone you want to see?
Tom took Mary's car keys because she was drunk.
You can't drink here.
Get the car!
Sami and Layla have been together for years.
She kissed him twice.
I accepted.
His idea is better than yours.
Get up!
I hate computers.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
It was their idea.
They blamed Sofia.
Are you finished?
She arrested him.
Where is the library?
Help us out.
Sami didn't look at me at all.
We have a guest.
Knock it off! Knock it off!
Where did Tom learn French?
He was sitting reading a book.
Someone is eating.
Can you give Tom and I a minute?
Layla was a bad boy.
You can't prove anything.
Mary came in.
Stop complaining!
Tom can't solve the problem by himself.
Sami didn't know who Layla was.
How many books do you have?
You are rich.
Nothing has happened.
It's up there.
Keep reading.
He went to Spain.
We asked for 40 seconds ago.
Where is your son?
Tom complained.
They didn't say anything.
Someone is in trouble.
Please stop!
You should eat something.
This is a complete fraud. And it's a scam.
I read books.
Forget about Tom!
You're better than Tom.
I ate it.
Come to the house.
You asked Alex.
I like swimming.
Respect me!
Once again, I don't accept your mistakes.
Tom is dating Mary.
How much can you pay for this?
Why are you afraid?
You're ready for the opening.
Mary is the same age as Tom.
Come to my room.
I have to do that now.
Let the water run.
It is springtime.
Agatu will die on the 20th of October.
Did she use it?
Father, bring us the pork chops!
Help us out here.
I'm surprised to see you.
You are both married.
Does Australia have a winter kitchen?
I don't think it was Tom.
Tom took the wind out of his sails.
It's old.
I left Australia on October 20.
Have you eaten your fill?
I see how you're reading.
Tom is afraid of his father.
Give me the truck!
Hi, this is Nancy.
I left.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
I'll wash my clothes tomorrow.
They still can't pronounce Tom's name.
Keep away!
I don't usually get to Boston in October.
Sami is not going to stop.
You are afraid.
You are a problem.
Ahmed is filled with jealousy.
Has anyone seen anything?
Someone called you.
I need someone to help me.
Be patient, old woman, he will soon come.
Are you Chinese?
The two met in October in Boston.
Uli Rohde, a beautiful German woman, sang a love song in the Kabyle language in the country of the Kabyles.
Did you put everything in?
Somebody has to do it.
Latin is a dead language.
Only Tom needs to know about this.
You are lucky.
How do you feel?
You look sick.
I'm going to do that, that's for sure.
Tom and Mary seem to be close friends.
It is impossible.
You wanted to talk to me, didn't you?
I have money.
I love her and she loves me.
Sami and Layla finally left together for the wedding.
You are blinded by love.
You are very lucky!
We know.
I know her.
Tom was robbed.
The black cat is eating the white cat.
I will go.
Put on your clothes!
Someone shouted.
She bought a bottle of water.
They were happy.
We'll ask him something else.
Are you scared?
What is your favorite team?
Follow your sister's example.
He is close to my age.
You still don't understand that.
Dinner is served!
I'll ask Tom to leave by then.
Tom couldn't get to Mary.
Could you please show me a picture?
Sami left his gun there.
Are you cheating on me?
Is this Japanese?
Did you see anything?
I need you here tomorrow.
Mary is waiting.
Tom looked sad.
Tom lost his temper.
God is.
Tom is back from Australia.
Tom has forgotten.
We talked about Australia.
Tom said he couldn't eat any more.
He is not a boy.
Someone else has done it before.
I don't want to live with you.
I speak a little French.
Tom told Mary that he was tired.
I have seen many Asian countries.
My garden is small.
I would die for you.
Your work is only a matter of time.
You hit Tom.
Your work is a bit of a hassle.
Take the Uber.
These books aren't Tom's.
I want to eat with you.
Get some rest.
Give it to whoever you want.
Can you put Tom on?
What did your mother say?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
I'm going to eat a banana.
You're not funny.
Tom wants to marry me.
I didn't sleep until the sun went down.
Tom thought that one day the lizard would protect him from the ants.
She knows how to live.
I was very ill in October.
Could you help me, please?
The spirit is down.
Sami is a very difficult person.
The teacher checked my bag.
Please, I want this book.
I love funny stories.
I am a human being.
It's our turn!
Can this happen in Australia?
Call Tom.
October is only three months away.
You are happy.
It's the dead.
Don't joke with me, Tom.
I'm not one to cheat.
I was married to you.
Is there anything in it that anyone else has seen?
Seek and you shall find.
There's nothing you can do to help.
Sami knows his limitations.
Just let me see it.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
He looks good.
I'm not your maid!
Do you drink a lot?
Someone came.
Some say it's a joke, and some say it's a lie.
Are you still in school?
You are part of the problem.
Someone wants to hurt you.
We'll discuss this problem in chapter three.
My name is Jack.
Please let us know.
Tom probably couldn't have escaped.
Tom wants to win a lot of money by gambling.
The roads are wet.
I'd better tell him that.
If you don't want to do it, don't!
The sick baby was being well looked after by the doctors.
What a terrible thing to happen!
I like to write articles in my native language.
I hate to work.
Enough of this!
Suit yourself!
No one will find him.
Shouldn't you be in tomorrow?
There is no Nobel Prize for mathematics.
Please shut up!
I want to know everything you've done.
Help me clean out the garage.
Have you seen your table?
Tom said he'd come tomorrow.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'll see you in October.
I was surprised to find out that I had a brother.
I'll ruin this place if I drop something.
Behave yourself.
I forgot your number.
Are you asleep?
I am starting a new life.
I was already thinking about you.
I like to eat pizza.
He who can bring down mountains can raise walls.
Tom was talking about Mary.
No one knows why.
We just finished eating.
Are you sure?
Don't go away from me!
Take care of yourself.
Somebody is sleeping here.
You'll find Tom's whiskey.
We did it only once.
I know French.
You have a fever.
Are you happy about this?
You shouldn't be so scared.
Someone called you.
I want to surprise everyone.
Did you find Tom's note?
Read your book.
See you later, mother.
Tom said he had a day off.
What a bitch!
You are a good student.
Someone broke this plate.
I've been meaning to talk to you again.
I'm not feeling well.
Look for another.
Tom started to laugh.
Which author do you like?
I already know Tom.
Let her go.
She built it.
Do you want to tell her?
Where is this near?
I'll try to help you.
No one is listening.
I want to learn Esperanto.
Please help me.
No one is worth it.
Who am I speaking to?
I'll take care of Tom.
My brothers and sisters!
I want a new dress.
Tom likes good dinners.
This is from Australia.
Tom has stopped smoking.
Somebody has to stop Tom.
She is a friend.
What kind of girls do you like?
Your day has come!
Try to calm Tom down.
Why didn't you take her home?
We are happy.
Did you give Tom a birthday present?
The milk should be ready in October.
Tom is sometimes rude.
Can you swim?
Are you ill?
Please!
Do not speak!
I look like you.
There is none.
Have you ever fought a sword?
The day is getting darker.
Do you have rice?
He fell in love with himself.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't do that again.
Tom is bored.
Tom is getting closer to Mary.
How much bread did you eat?
This boy is a good boy.
You have lost your French.
I think there's someone in the next room.
Finally, it started to snow.
He refused to believe her.
Whose neighbor is this?
You play a lot of guitar.
I'm very happy for you.
I need the truth.
This house is too small.
Don't forget your money.
Take your days off.
Tom is a warrior.
Someone is looking.
You have him.
It may be true.
Every question has an answer.
Tom will show you how to do it if you ask him.
Stop whining!
How long will they be there?
A friend of mine called me last night.
Tom ran outside to see what had happened.
I saw someone kissing Tom.
You can read this book.
Tom loves you.
You should behave yourself.
Someone is now or has been here.
Are you here alone?
Close your eyes.
Who said that?
I'm good for you.
We serve with what we have.
They don't want me to tell them what to buy.
I haven't said anything yet.
I teach English as a profession.
Tell them I'm here.
I think he ate his own cookies.
I need someone to help me.
I decided to tell the truth.
Layla is waiting outside.
When he was young, Sami would have been a very smart boy.
Do Mary and Tom understand French?
Are you at home?
Where are you from?
Someone is waiting for Tom.
They will do what I have told them.
I don't want Tom to stay.
Who said that?
Is this the bomb?
You're on your own.
My wife has a lot of work.
I don't have to say anything.
There's no need to smoke.
You have a very beautiful smile.
He didn't say anything.
Tom isn't like that.
Aren't we going home soon?
I want to talk to someone.
I did nothing.
Sami saw the video.
I turned to the right.
Remember last year.
Tom bled.
Let's dance together.
There must be someone who can do it.
To your health and better days!
You can have whatever you want.
Take care of yourself!
I love you very much.
Tom is working for Mary.
This is a gift for you.
Just take me home.
I think Tom is right.
Tom Jackson is my favorite author.
I wanted to kill you.
No one knows who killed Tom.
You ask!
She speaks English.
Tom collects old things.
No one heard the conversation.
I'll take that one.
You have already paid.
Tom missed you.
Look at yourself.
I'm sorry that Tom wasn't told the truth.
Mine is better than yours.
It's a good car!
I know that Tom is a joker.
Eat all you want.
What sport would you like to watch?
Please don't forget to say goodbye to your family.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
May I ask who you are?
She misses me.
Teachers have to explain everything in detail, not just yell and tell students to go home and read their books.
Tom didn't drive his car today.
Who was the last?
Are you ready?
Are you human?
What we are not strong enough for makes us stronger.
Are you two girls back?
Most Hollywood films have a happy ending.
That's all for now.
Who owns this truck?
We're heading there.
Has anyone called the security forces?
We have to help Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
We are expecting guests this evening.
Get out of here!
I don't know what to tell Tom.
We can if we want, but we can't if we don't want.
I could ask you to come with me.
They say that the longest journey is the one that's the longest.
Tom is drunk.
The revolution!
Are you serious?
Have you been drinking?
The famous Kabyle writer Mulud Ferεun, who became a member of the OAS in 1962, said: "We only know who we are when we become someone else".
I need someone to help me.
He will learn French.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Bring it here.
I think Tom and Mary are tired.
We didn't sleep with Tom.
How long?
Sam doesn't need this.
The way to the top of the mountain is to walk straight ahead.
I hope Tom's sister is okay.
He didn't help his father.
I hurried home.
Human religion is more open than the religion of God.
I didn't hear anything.
Don't leave!
I don't eat fish or fish.
I eat and drink.
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Check this out.
Leave it all.
I'm not a girl.
Do you like dogs?
Do you like football?
Champagne, please.
I want you to work with them.
Sami didn't like that.
She tried to trick me into thinking.
Tom is not going to be able to be with Mary.
Who are you waiting for?
I'd like to know who's coming with us.
Somebody should stop you.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I just want to tell you that I love you.
Who is your brother?
Were you here alone?
Sami has known Layla for many years.
Step into the shadows!
Mine is bigger than yours.
You can kill anyone.
Beauty is beautiful.
I didn't understand what the teacher said.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
He spent a few months in Scotland.
I will eat the porridge.
We are trying.
Your day has come!
Why?
There is no taxi.
Have you read the book "The Last Summer of Reason" by Taher Ja'ut?
What a memory!
Please invite Tom in.
Will you be in Boston next year, too?
Did someone call you?
She can't love you.
Tom lives in Australia.
Tom has been very vocal.
Tom's hair is dark.
Don't forget to call.
It's not a problem at all!
The snake gives you a bite!
Have you seen my sister?
How do I correct typos in the Kabyle language in LibreOffice?
Why are you sitting by yourself?
The Muslim God understands only Arabic; but one can pray to other gods in any language one chooses.
Your father has a temper.
You need a good wife.
Something is missing.
I'm guessing your car is parked.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Add another coat.
What are you going to eat for lunch?
What happened in Boston?
I know that Tom is from Australia.
Tell him tomorrow.
My mother wouldn't let me live.
Why don't you do all that?
Let Tom go.
Tom proposed to Mary.
Mistakes were made.
Someone should do something.
Shit!
Just talk to them.
I want to see your sister.
What were they going to drink?
I'm going to learn English now.
We'll do it again.
I didn't speak French when I got there.
You're lucky to continue working in a place like this.
What do you want her to do?
Thank you, that's all there is to it.
Tom will get married in October.
Don't you know you can solve this problem by yourself?
Is there someone you'd like to see?
Sami was trying to get better.
Sami was young.
Both of my parents grew up in Boston.
He asked his friend.
The room was all clean.
Tom was rejected from Harvard.
I don't think you talked to me.
The government was oppressing the people.
My grandfather likes to read.
I want to see my son.
Tom loves his job.
Sami is not a criminal.
What did your boss say?
