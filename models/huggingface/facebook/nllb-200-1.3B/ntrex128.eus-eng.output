Members of the Welsh Assembly have expressed concern that they will be treated like puppets.
Several members of the Assembly have expressed dissatisfaction after hearing the suggestion to change the name of their office as MWP (Member of the Legislative Assembly for Wales).
The idea came about after plans were developed to change the name of the Assembly of the Legislative Assembly of Wales.
Members of the political council are concerned that this plan is a good way to make fun of them.
A Labour member in the House of Commons said the following in English, which rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
If you're from outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means inozo and pwp means shit.
For his part, a member of the Scottish Assembly said the whole group was not very happy and suggested finding alternative names.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales has also said he is open to new ideas to change the name, but has also expressed his concerns about the rhymes that the MWP changes could entail.
To better understand this conflict, it is important to note that the Welsh w and the English y in Yorkshire have a similar pronunciation.
The Assembly's committee, which is drafting a legal framework for name changes, has stated that "As for the members of the Assembly, they will be solely responsible for choosing the descriptors they wish to use".
Under the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Assembly of Wales has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the selection of proposed proposals and, in general, the name of the Welsh Legislative Assembly received numerous expressions of support.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name Member of the Legislative Assembly for Wales or WMP (in English acronyms), but the name MWP was decided upon in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly, on the other hand, suggest alternatives, but it can be extremely difficult to choose an option unanimously; especially for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who has had to submit a draft with changes in a few weeks.
However, the legislation of the changes will affect the functioning of the assembly; among other things, rules will be created to prevent activities that could bring bad reputation to the members of the assembly and the design of the assembly system will be managed with the help of this law.
When debating a change in legislation, members of the House of Representatives will have the opportunity to make a decision as to their names.
Macedonians will take part in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to settle a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a re-claim of its territory and has repeatedly blocked its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the name change plebiscite, has said he will not attend the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev) say it is just the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's Church lose their sound because of the troubles of the churches of Harlem.
"I've spoken to a number of senior citizens who say that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams suggests.
Today, there is nothing.
She says it's normal to disappear at bars.
"People use other methods of socializing", he says.
"Bar is no longer the neighborhood living room where people used to hang out".
As for the churches, they're worried that the proceeds from the sale of assets won't be enough and that sooner or later we'll be back to square one.
Also, churches could be replaced by housing and neighborhood shrines would be built in properties filled with people who don't care about neighborhoods.
"The people who are going to buy the condominiums are going to be white people, and that's why the churches are going to close down fast, because these new people are not members of the church congregations".
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a black metropolis; it was the 1870 Metropolis community and St. Martin's was built a decade later.
In 1930, the original Methodist congregation moved out of the neighborhood.
Shortly after that, a congregation of black people took over.
Reverend John Howard Johnson's black congregation took over St. Martin's Church; Howard organized a boycott against shops on 125th Street in Harlem that did not hire or promote black people.
The church suffered some damage in a fire in 1939, but the parishioners of Father Johnson devised several plans to rebuild the church and commissioned the assembly of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to the earldom of St. Martin, named the bell "the bell of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July gave it another name: "Cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also notes that it was the first carillon played by a black musician in the world; the musician, Dionysus A. Lind, went to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather explains that St. Martin's did not represent his musician.
In recent months, San Martin has seen tiring comings and goings of various architects and contractors; some of them brought in by lay leaders or the episcopal diocese.
The parish council (a council of lay leaders) sent a letter to the diocese in July to verify that the costs of hiring these people would be passed on to the parish, as the parish has nothing to do with the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Several parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy is injured by a shark while hunting for oysters in the California coast.
According to police, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while hunting for oysters off the coast of California, on the first day of oyster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. at Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel, who told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was swimming with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when his friend heard him screaming for help; he then swam with a group of people to his friend to help him out of the water.
Hamlet thought his friend was screaming for joy at finding an oyster, but then he realized that his friend was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I got bit!
"I could see his entire clavicle", Hammel said after seeing his friend.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark!' " Hammel explained, shouting.
He was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is critical.
No detection of the species of shark that attacked.
Captain Larry Giles, a rescue co-pilot, has just released a press release saying that a shark was spotted a few weeks earlier, but the species was not considered endangered.
Giles also reported that the victim's injuries were above the knee.
Police have closed all access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas in the 48-hour period required for an investigation and to ensure the safety of the public.
Giles said there are over 135 species of sharks in the sand, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market.
Sainsbury's has taken over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and now offers department stores style beauty with a variety of experienced and specialized staff.
While sales of fashion and household products are shrinking, £2.8 billion has been invested in the UK's ever-growing beauty sector, with larger beauty departments being built and testing in 11 stores across the country. If they deliver good results, more stores will open next year.
Investments in the beauty sector have allowed supermarkets to take advantage of the TVs, microwaves and home goods departments.
According to Sainsbury's, the supermarket will double its beauty product offering to more than 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands.
As for the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, they will have more space in the branded areas, like the areas that can be found in Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket is reintroducing its Boutique brand makeup, which is a completely vegan product; younger shoppers are increasingly demanding such products.
The fragrance shop will also be offering its women's fragrance at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first in Croydon, south London, which opened last week and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, which will open later this year.
Because of the online shopping and the daily trend of buying food in small local stores, supermarkets have to work hard to attract customers.
Mike Coupé, CEO of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said that the points of sale will take the style of the department stores and the supermarket chain will reduce the threat from competitors Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-service and food products.
The supermarket Sainsbury's has opened Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores and has opened several Habitats, after both chains bought it two years ago; as a result, food sales have strengthened and the purchased chains are more profitable than ever.
The supermarket's beauty and pharmacy department tried to reopen, but the strategy failed.
It later merged with Sainsbury's Boots in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended when the process of dividing profits from supermarket pharmacy departments became burnt paper.
A new strategy was set up when the Sainsbury's supermarket sold its 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The Lloyds chain will play a role in the planned plan: it will add a large range of luxury skincare brands to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said: "We've improved the look of our beauty departments so that our customers can find the best environment.
We have also hired highly experienced staff to give you detailed advice regarding the products.
We have designed our range of brands to meet all requirements and, thanks to comfortable environments and locations, our beauty departments offer a modern and easy alternative to shops that use outdated methods.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew his £11 million offer.
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has left in anger after TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn an offer of £11 million related to a permanent brand deal, as she wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, the brand of home-made goods and ingredients.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The host of This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Following Holly Willoughby's resignation to accept contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV, Dragons' Den star Peter Jones became furious at the last minute for abandoning the lucrative business the pair had established.
According to our sources, a tense meeting was held at the Marlow headquarters on Tuesday, and as a result, Jones was extremely upset when he heard the explanation from our most famous TV personality that she was going to accept new contracts worth £1.5 million and therefore would no longer be able to devote time to Truly's home-made products and ingredients.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, left the UK to move to a holiday home after Jones announced on Instagram that he was quitting the Truly brand business.
A source said that this option has always been one of Holly's priorities.
That decision will secure his future for the next two decades.
However, the decision to leave the label is a bit of a shock.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, when the stamp offer was closing.
In fact, the warehouse at the Marlow headquarters is full of merchandise for sale".
According to experts, the company is on the verge of losing millions of pounds due to the departure of the presenter of This Morning (who is the UK's most profitable presenter); the company has invested a lot of money in various products (including cushions, candles, clothes and household products) and will now have to face the delays that may arise.
Besides, this conflict could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children and Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, have been close friends for over a decade.
Willoughby and Capp founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
Both couples always plan their vacations together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will serve as brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source in Jones's team said last night that he would not make any disclosures about his business activities.
It was a tough conversation, but then we fell in love.
He was joking about the media's negative comments he was going to get, all for making a "inappropriate" comment about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving so much?
Trump uses his "TV host" voice to reply in a silly way:
I didn't give anything.
After the first summit in Singapore in June, Kim said that President Trump wanted to organize a second summit, which would lead to an incredibly important step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, the process of nuclear disarmament has stalled.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen any "appropriate response" from the United States regarding the country's steps toward nuclear disarmament.
Instead, the sanctions imposed by the US have been tightened in an attempt to keep the country under pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more optimistic outlook, which he expressed in his last speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are better than ever", he said.
Plus, we were about to declare war on North Korea.
That war could kill billions.
But now we have this extraordinary relationship with each other".
He also said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results, including the end of missile tests, improved hostage releases and the beginning of the delay in the rest of the US military.
It also describes his unusual perspective on his interviews with Kim.
"It's incredibly easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to force their way into the country, we have 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the staff.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate a remote island and kill hundreds
After the Lomboko earthquake, for example, the help of international non-profit organizations was no longer needed.
Although 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, the earthquake was not declared a national disaster (a prerequisite for requesting assistance from nations).
"In many cases, unfortunately, the government has been clear that it does not need international assistance, so this situation is a challenge", says Ms. Sumbung.
Save the Children is forming a team to travel to Palu, but it does not yet know if volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, the representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian officials are working to get the international agencies to accept the assistance.
Despite Indonesia having suffered several earthquakes, the country has taken over-the-top measures to cope with the fury of nature.
Tsunami-proof fortifications have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few fortifications on the coast.
Palu doesn't have a siren to warn people, and even if the alarm goes off, maybe that's why so many people die.
When the weather is good, traveling between the Indonesian islands can be a challenge.
Furthermore, natural disasters complicate efforts to implement logistics.
A hospital ship to provide treatment to the victims of the earthquake was anchored in Lombok and is now heading to Palura; however, it will take at least three days to reach the disaster site.
President Joko Widodo's campaign was based on projects to improve Indonesia's infrastructure and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, funding has been cut and President Joko's administration is in trouble as it prepares for next year's elections.
Mr. Joko also has trouble controlling sectarian tensions in Indonesia, for example, most members of the Islamic Party have adopted a more conservative view of religion.
As a result, more than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Islamic gangs have taken to the streets to wage their battles using machetes, bows, arrows and similar weapons, among others.
Watch the goal of the Liverpool match between Daniel Sturridge and Chelsea.
Thanks to Daniel Sturridge's goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, Liverpool survived the Premier League game against Chelsea, which they had previously thought was a losing one.
Xherdan Shaqiri's pass from 30 yards out of Chealsea gave Sturridge a chance to change the score 1-0.
He put the ball to his left before he kicked the doorpost.
That kick sent the ball flying up into the sand and into the top right of the net.
Eventually, the ball overcame Kepa Arrizabalagá's defense and entered the net.
"Shaq is always in the top half of the field, so I wanted to get in that position to get the ball, so I tried to get as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw it coming and with one touch, I had the ball at my feet, and after that I didn't have much time to think: I just took my chance".
The Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute, and Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time.
In that game, the blue forward returned a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic, who turned around in the middle of the field and ran into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic was banging in the middle of the field.
Then he hit the ball hard, right into Hazard's foot in the sand.
Hazard overcame the opposing team's defense and hit the net of the goalpost with a left-footed punch that destroyed Liverpool's Alisson Becker defense.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will also face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Tuesday afternoon in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The disaster agency said Sunday that the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have raised the death toll to 832.
Representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference that after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and waves of 20 feet high on Friday, several people were trapped in the rubble of buildings.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, was flooded by the debris.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for stabbing and killing a woman.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mew, John Street. So far, a 32-year-old man has been arrested as the main suspect in the murder.
Police are asking residents to call the police if they see or hear anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is just beginning, but if anyone sees or hears anything on John Street in Birkenhead, we'd love to contact them".
We also want to ask for help from the drivers of cars, including taxi drivers who might be able to record, because there may be information recorded that is vital for the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found in a house.
That afternoon, several people who knew the woman arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning.
As the investigation progresses, the police are in contact with the victim's family.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to break into her apartment, but police told him no one could enter or leave the building.
When she heard what had happened, she was shocked.
The neighbors will have to wait a few hours before they can enter their homes.
A policeman was talking to a neighbor who was suggesting that the entire area would be considered a crime scene.
Later, a woman appeared in tears.
He kept saying, "This is scary".
At 2pm, two police patrol cars entered the police station and another patrol was stopped outside.
Several police officers have searched the apartments in the building.
Anyone with information can send a message to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers (0800 555 111); simply cite the 247 record of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue in Parliament becomes the ultimate target of the "history rewriting" trend.
If it disappears, it will be poetic justice: just as the Taliban destroyed so many religious sites, so the puritanical fanatics in England did the same for so many historical and cultural sites throughout their country.
The Cromwell Society, however, says that Mr. Crick's suggestion is "absurd" and that he is "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the Cromwell Society's representative, said the following: "The debate generated about the removal of the statues of Oliver Cromwell from outside Westminster Palace is inevitable; Cromwell has become an object.
Cromwell himself never requested or organized the iconic events of the English Civil War.
Perhaps we should sacrifice another Cromwell for the deeds of his great-grandfather, Thomas, over the past century.
The impressive portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is part of the views of the 19th century and our historiography; many people still believe that the actions of this person should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Fewer people than in the 19th century believe this, yes, but still many people believe Cromwell was a defender of parliament against outside pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about monarchy.
Whether or not he is an accurate representation of this person will continue to be the subject of historical debate.
However, we can safely say that the conflict that occurred in the middle of the 17th century was the starting point for the development of our nation, and the famous Cromwell was one of the parties that participated in that starting point.
"The title of Lord Protector is a cause for celebration and remembrance of all his achievements".
A pig killed by a Chinese farmer.
A pig has attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China, according to local media.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead, with an artery severed and covered in blood, in a pigsty at the Liupanshu market in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to implant pigs in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
On Wednesdays, she usually travels from Yunnan province with her cousin to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found the body of the deceased and found the door to the adjacent pigsty open.
He also mentioned that there was a large male pig in the pigsty with blood in his mouth.
The forensic report confirms that a pig worth 550 pounds killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed", explained his cousin, whose last name is Wu, in the Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. (Friday) to feed the pigs.
They found his body an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not of Yuan's or his cousin's blood.
According to a market owner telling the Evening News, the pig is being locked up to prevent further attacks and allow the police to gather evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and the market leader are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pig attacks before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650 pound pig had run into a Welsh farmer in his tractor, and his wife had to chase him away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon had his body eaten by pigs, and after that, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, it can act as a causative agent.
"They love to play.
They're like children and they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
She said, "You just have to show some respect".
Small storms from Hurricane Rosa will leave rainfall in the southwest of the United States.
Weather forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves into the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa will produce winds of 85 miles per hour, which will make it a Category 1 hurricane, according to Eastern Time, on Sunday, 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
By Sunday, Rosa is expected to move north.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming in the Pacific Ocean and will move eastward to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baja will move into the California peninsula as a tropical storm, bringing tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Additionally, on Monday, Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
This will be followed by tropical humidity combined with low pressure, leading to heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
In local areas, water depths of 1 to 4 inches can be dangerous due to flash floods, debris streams and landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rainfall can leave 2-3 inches of water per hour and in specific locations; particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to be about 2 to 4 inches in the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Tropical rainfall is erratic, which can cause flash floods and conditions of erosion.
It is not recommended to go for a walk in the desert when a tropical storm is forecast.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into violent streams and storms can bring winds and dust.
Additionally, the decrease in pressure will lead to local downpours along the coast of Southern California.
Rain can collect up to half an inch of water, potentially creating small waste streams and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
There is also a possibility of scattered tropical rainfall in Arizona on Sunday and Monday, but more rainfall is expected on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to all four corners and last until Wednesday.
October may see severe temperature changes in the United States as the Arctic cools, but temperatures in the tropics will remain warm.
Sometimes these temperatures can vary greatly over short distances.
For example, on Sunday, there will be significant temperature changes in the central United States.
There's almost a 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will reach and spread to all areas.
Central and eastern United States will experience a warm October, with temperatures in the 80s from the southern plains to the northeast.
It's also expected to be 80 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, with temperatures expected to be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, the eastern United States will experience above-average temperatures for the first two weeks of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's statement.
More than 20 million people watched Tuesday's Channel Six newscasts of the shocking statements of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the latter of whom sued Kavanaugh for sexual abuse he suffered in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continued and the network interrupted its Friday regular programming for a last-minute newscast where Arizona Senator Jeff Flake reached a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
According to Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh repeatedly touched him while he was drunk and tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In Kavanaugh's name, he made a passionate statement saying he was absolutely certain that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, approximately 20.4 million people watched the declaration on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, this number was not immediately available to other channels that made the declaration; among others, PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people watching TV in the office.
To give you an example, you could say the audience is like a football game or the Academy Awards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's statement is widely accepted by the network's anchors, who averaged 5.69 million viewers during the time he made the statement, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After hearing the testimony, the public's interest was renewed.
Flake was the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican Party announced that they would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS captured Kavanaugh surrounded by protesters on Friday as he attempted to climb an elevator to testify at the Magistrates' Meeting.
He was seen live on CNN with his eyes down as the protesters clashed.
"I'm here, standing right in front of you", said a woman.
Do you really think he's telling the truth?
And she added, "Your power is great, but many women have nothing".
At that point, and before the elevator doors closed, Flake said that his office had issued a statement and would provide more details during a review of the meeting.
The broadcast was being broadcast live hourly on cable and cable TV while the Senate was voting on Kavanaugh's nomination for senator.
However, Flake said he would vote after a week of the FBI examining the arguments against the candidate, remember he was calling on the minority Democratic party to do so.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flake had almost complete confidence in the investigation.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flake's decision was powerful, because the Republican Party doesn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without doing the poll.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics on the basis of Brexit
According to an interview in the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of playing with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the country's interests.
On September 29, 2018, the British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party's speech in Birmingham.
In another interview that made the front page of the paper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson criticized what he called the "Lady Game" for Brexit and said the taxes Britain and the EU were paying were "totally ridiculous".
Police arrested Dyteon Simpson for the murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in jail for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Police have shared video of Sims and Simpson arguing, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
A WAFB associate at CBS said that the police recovered those glasses from the scene of the crime and said that Simpson's DNA was on them.
When Simpson was questioned, he confessed to shooting Wayd.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge District Court issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound from head to neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police's Department of Fugitives, the state police's Criminology Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their assistance in finding the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their readiness and commitment to upholding justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 guard grew up in Baton Rouge and his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Wayden's death.
"These are the things that always bother you", Wade said.
A volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City.
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Pre-Catalogy Center warned Mexicans on Saturday and recommended staying away from the volcano after detecting several activity in the crater; 183 gas and ash spills were recorded for 24 hours.
Half of the volcano also had several tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in some neighborhoods of Mexico City (e.g. Xochimilcon).
Geophysicists have detected increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Fight between police and Catalan independence activists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash between pro-independence protesters and riot police as thousands of people joined the parties that were attending to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan independence elections.
The riot police stopped a group of disguised separatists, but threw eggs and paint dust at them, creating dust clouds in the crowded streets.
More fights broke out later because the police were using their batons to stop the fighting.
Independence groups also marched for several hours singing "We shall not forget, we shall not forgive" in front of the unionists, who were chanting "Long live Spain".
According to local reporters, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the clashes.
There is a lot of tension in this territory that is trying to find independence after the October 1st elections, which were illegal according to the Madrid government, but the Catalan independenceists got a day to celebrate.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but the participation of citizens was very low due to the number of anti-independence citizens who wanted to boycott the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1,000 people were injured after the police attack, when they went to the polling booths to stop voters, which led to violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday to avoid a rally in support of the National Police.
There was a march, but he was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who attended the independence march with his wife, and said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia achieving independence.
We had a great time last year.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck.
After a brief but significant victory in the local elections in December, the Catalan independence party has had many problems this year to retain public interest; some party leaders are either exiled or arrested and are now awaiting trial for organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording the pro-police rally on his phone, blames politicians from both parties for the situation.
"There's more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who has been in prison since last year awaiting trial, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections scheduled for next year.
"If I run for the European elections, it will be the best way to denounce the reduction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government", he said.
Three men arrested for crashing into a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested for repeatedly crashing into a London house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent, Tuesday at 7:30pm (BST).
Detective Bob Blemmings said the building and its doors were damaged.
Also, it looks like the car was hit with a crossbow.
Thanks to Menga's shot, Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal confirmed Livingston's height.
Livingston's promotion impresses Rangers players and Steven Gerrard scores his second defeat in 18 games as leader of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's throw was the deciding moment for Gary Holten's Hibernian as the team climbed the ladder in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains winless this season in the Premiership and will have to play against the leading Hearts (who have eight more points) next Sunday.
Before that game, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Livingston are undefeated with six games left in the season, and Holt has no idea what a defeat is since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston's been losing a lot of chances to a strong crowd.
Holt's team had to take the lead before scoring, and his incredible accuracy caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson made the run but all his efforts were wasted at the gate and then Alan Lithgow redirected his efforts to the gate after Craig Halkett's head injury.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play, but they knew the visitors could be annoying anytime.
And in that mood, he scored the decisive goal.
The Rangers gave up a free throw and Livingston created an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to score, but Menga scored a goal if the latter touched the ball and hit the halfway mark.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers were dominating the field, but the home defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly passed the game without a problem.
This pattern continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos's throw required Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman was unable to score because of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow avoided Livingston's next play.
Passes were repeatedly inserted into Livingston's sand and repeatedly taken out by home players; two penalties were called, one for Halkett challenging replacement Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand, but both were dismissed.
Livingston's game is "remarkable" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont on the Scottish BBC, at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
Livingston's game was exceptional and he scored a perfect score.
They've done great things for me and they have a very good chance of advancing.
The style of play and the team has hardly changed since they arrived in the first division, but Holt has been an outstanding coach: he has put the team on the right track since his arrival.
He had some heroes.
Captain Halkett has been remarkable in organizing and managing an unparalleled defense, and Menga has made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall are nervous throughout the game.
The Rangers weren't very inspiring, though.
They work very well under Gerrard, but they've forgotten the standards that their coach set.
The last play was too weak and they only beat the home defense once, so the Rangers need to move fast if they want to get out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan is receiving a hostile welcome in Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was organized to repair relations between NATO allies.
They discussed a number of issues, including the lack of human rights and press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkey outside Turkey.
Due to security measures imposed by the police, 25,000 people were blocked from gathering in front of the mosque, but several supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (mostly Kurds) joined their voices to protest against Erdogan's policy measures and the German government's decision to welcome the president.
The disagreements over the president were reflected by protesters on both sides, with some Turks in Germany calling him a hero and others calling him a mere autocrat.
A cyclist is killed in a car crash in Deptford.
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m., a busy intersection in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
On Childers Street, a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday, another cyclist was killed a month ago and the driver escaped.
The Met Police are working to identify the man and alert his family.
Some roads have been closed and the usual route of bus lines has changed; motorists are also advised to avoid this area.
Six officers wounded in Long Lartin prison riot
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 09:30am on Sunday and the riots have not yet ended.
Tornado officers arrived at the prison to put an end to a riot that started with eight arrests, which has so far been confined to one wing of the building.
The officers had minor wounds on their faces and were treated on the spot.
A representative of the prison service said the following, "We have dispatched our experienced prison personnel to put an end to the riots at HMP Long Lartin".
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate any form of violence in our prisons, and those who initiated the riots will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time in the bars of the prison.
The HMP Long Lartin prison is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the most violent criminals in the country.
In June, the prison warden was hospitalized for assaulting a detainee.
Additionally, in October last year riot police officers were sent to the prison to stop a violent riot, where detainees were attacking workers with pool sticks.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (possibly benefiting drier areas)
It's very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but it's likely to happen next week as Hurricane Rosa depletes its power, visiting the southwest desert and threatening sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding that could form on Monday and Friday; the hurricane will enter from western Arizona and move south and east into Nevada; it will also pass through southeastern California and Utah; through the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, among others.
Rosa will fly directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, but Monday's rains will signal her arrival.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted: "Since 1950, 10 tropical cyclones formed within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression".
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border".
According to the latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center, there will be a buildup of 2 to 4 inches of water, and a maximum of 6 inches of water on the shore of Mogollon, Arizona.
As for other areas of the southwest of the desert (the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Arro, among others), 1-2 inches of water will accumulate; in isolated places up to 4 inches will accumulate.
For those who expect sudden floods, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing for the droughts the land has suffered.
Floods should not be underestimated, but these downpours could be beneficial to the droughts that the southwest is suffering from.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, which is the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The strength of Hurricane Rosa will remain strong through Sunday morning and will produce maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, with a maximum wind speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific and as a result, it is weakening in strength.
They are expected to reach Mexico on Monday afternoon or night as a tropical storm.
With strong storms in parts of Mexico, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "rainfall will leave water depths of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to southwest Sonora, with potential for rainfall of up to 10 inches in some places".
Rosa will then pass through northern Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression; then it will pass through Arizona and move south into Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threat to Rosa or its storm surge is severe thunderstorms in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States", said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains will cause sudden floods and dangerous debris flows in deserts and landslides in mountains.
Four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was shot at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at 04:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested that night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
If anyone has a video or a clue to what happened, our police colleagues are asking for your help.
Trump says Kavanaugh is facing the unreasonable wrath of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh would face the "absurdity and wrath" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
On Tuesday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, completely denying the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, who, according to the woman, was raped by Kavanaugh decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified after hearing his testimony.
The President said this on Saturday, "The people of the United States saw the courage, intelligence and quality of Kavanaugh.
"The votes for Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he is the finest legal mind of our time, a jurist who has dedicated his life to protecting our public service", the president told supporters in West Virginia.
Not only did the president talk about Kavanaugh's nomination, but also about the importance of the Republican Party in this election.
"Five weeks to vote in the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm going to campaign", she said.
"That's why I'm here, to fight for the best candidates.
Trump also said that the Democratic Party is using strategies to block and hinder his campaign.
According to a senior Republican official to CNN, the process of voting for Kavanaugh's nomination will be held in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
On Saturday, at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities, most of them as huge waves washed up on the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday in the city of Palu to celebrate a festival, but at dusk waves of six metres (18 ft) swept the coast, dragging several people to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The tsunami threat was issued yesterday, but people were still on the beach doing various activities and did not immediately flee, so they became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the representative of the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB) said in an interview in Jakarta.
"The tsunami dragged cars, logs and houses and destroyed everything on the ground", says Nugroho, "and even more, the tsunami traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before reaching the coast".
"Several people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived", the spokesman said.
Approximately 16,700 people have visited the 24 centers in Palo.
Several buildings and shops were destroyed, a bridge was destroyed and a mosque surrounded by water can be seen in aerial photographs taken by the disaster relief agency.
The aftershocks continued to hit the coast on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
According to a report released by the Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Agency (BPPT), the energy level released by the major earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located in a long, narrow bay, may have something to do with the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
According to Nugroho, the disaster was "extremely extensive", with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found among the ruins of the destroyed buildings, resulting in 540 more injured and 29 people missing.
Nugroho also said the number of casualties and disaster could increase along the 300-kilometer (190-mile) coast of Palu; specifically a place called Donggala, which is near the epicenter.
"The media in Donggala is not functioning and we have no information", said Nugroho.
According to the Red Cross, there are over 300,000 people in the area, and staff and volunteers are currently moving to the affected areas to provide assistance.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", she said.
On Saturday, the agency was criticized for not reporting the tsunami that devastated Palu, but officials said the waves appeared after the warning was broadcast.
A video shared on social media shows a man in a building screaming about an impending tsunami to warn people on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water reaches the coast, dragging buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages, and all communications in Palo were cut off, making it difficult for the competent authorities to organize rescue efforts.
According to officials, the military has sent relief planes from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need food and basic goods.
The city's airport has reopened to facilitate relief efforts and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation center in Palo on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has killed over 800 people.
It's a tragedy, you know.
World Vision workers from Donggala have arrived in Palu City without any problems (the workers have built a shelter in the yard of the organization's office), but they have seen firsthand the terrible situation left by the disaster, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
That's too bad.
Although aid groups began the sad repair of the works in the disaster cases, some complained that experienced workers and helpers had advised not to go to Palura.
According to Indonesian law, international financing, supply and manpower supply can only begin after the national disaster zone is classified.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", says Aulia Arrianini, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open the doors for international aid, but it's not yet classified as such".
On the second night of their stay in Palun after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still missing still had not lost hope for the unlikely miracle of their loved ones being found.
On Saturday, they pulled a baby out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with the body of her mother beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team trained two of the missing paragliders who were participants in the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
"As an expert in the world of parasol, I have my emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse in the parapentist community, he was sending WhatsApp messages to competitors who were at the beach party.
Her messages, however, only got one gray arrow, not two blue marks.
"I guess that means those messages weren't sent", he added.
Thieves stole $26,750 while they were filling out ATMs in Newport on the Leve.
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee filling out a cash register in Newport on the Brink, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in his notice.
While he was working, another man "attacked the Brink's worker from behind and stole a bag of money from her on a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, the notice said, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identities, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West, who changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter, saying "a creature formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the term "Ye" for a while, and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
He made the change before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where Yandi was expected to present his latest album.
She took part in the show in place of Ariana Grande, who according to the show's creator, was unable to participate due to emotional reasons.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has indicated that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'zu' in the Bible", West recently stated, talking about the album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are us.
It's from Kanye, which means one thing, to become Ye -- a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This work reflects who we are".
He's one of the few rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has also been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has indicated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Even Jay-Z, who worked with West in the past, has changed the punctuation and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO has pledged not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged not to use armed force or the military against his people as the country marks the 50th anniversary of a repression that shed blood against students.
Lopez Obrador, on Saturday, swore at Plaza Tlatelolco that he would "never use the army to repress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, as they took to the streets across Latin America to stop the rise of leftist students.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexicans get an education with monthly stipends and more free public universities.
He says that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are what drive young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding for AA.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AA expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made several announcements about AA, even though the US as a whole has no official AA strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year to become the best in AA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AA study would be a good start, since the other countries are far from the U.S. and we're looking for the next discovery in AA", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of major AA discoveries in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has investigated one of China's top AA companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AA system that overcame America's top-tier Othello player and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research, and was president of Google in the China area.
Lee praised the ongoing technology competitions of the US government, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Competition, and asked when the next one would be held to help identify the next dreamers.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee says.
"It's not that China is leading the academic leadership, it's the corporate leadership", Lee added.
Facebook, Google, and a lot of other tech companies have hired some of the brightest college guys to work with AA over the last few years.
Lee also said that changing immigration policy would help the U.S. to encourage AA.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to AA doctors", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released the Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China, the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund people in academic institutions just like they do in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Center for Artificial Intelligence, bringing together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI NEXT.
As for the NSF, today it invests over $100 million a year in AA research.
Meanwhile, the UK legislation that would have created the National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled in recent months.
Macedonians held a referendum to decide whether or not to change the name of the country.
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change its name to the former Republic of Macedonia, ending decades of conflict that has blocked Greece's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which once had a province called Macedonia, still claims to be named after its northern neighbors, blocking its entry into NATO and the UK.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say that the change would be detrimental to the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavic citizens.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and his campaign boycott raised doubts about whether he would achieve the 50 percent he needed to win the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper should have been, "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with the Greek agreement?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worthwhile to give Macedonia a chance to join the EU and NATO, as it is one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was dissolved.
"I am here to vote on the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because that will bring us a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have indicated that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A name change would require three-thirds vote in the House.
The state election commission said no unforeseen events were reported until 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent voted, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of those eligible voted.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjosze Tanevsky, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name and the possibility of joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and stairs to the shops that wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join on our terms, not by the server door", said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can look to China or Russia and we can be part of the Euro-Asian unification".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership can bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of the American people are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a simple "no" would "confirm our future".
According to a poll released by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - less than necessary.
Another poll, by the Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of residents were considering voting on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent indicated they would vote for it.
To make the referendum a success, we need to get 50 percent plus one vote in favor.
If the referendum is a mistake, it would be the first major mistake in the Western-oriented policy since it began in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has overtaken Brighton's defence to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's entire defence in Saturday's 2-0 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored the goal with ease, a goal scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goal scorer received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before he went into the open field.
Aguirre suddenly found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He pushed one of the defenders after escaping several others on the edge of the Brighton sand.
Then he made a left turn, and there was Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Agueror in the sand on the first touch, and he used his right foot to overtake Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is overcoming a lot of problems in his foot", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And it was.
We were so happy that he scored at that moment".
But Sterling gave the Blues the lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguirre caught the ball in the Brighton field.
He gave Leroy Sane a perfect pass from the left flank.
San made a few touches on the far pole before pointing to Sterling.
The blue jersey guy pushed the ball into the net before it went off the line.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena football ground in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end for the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the tournament, there wasn't much reason to force them to start over.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer is looking to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the Rockies still suffer the effects of a tie, still one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have a good lead with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but they'll still have to try to win their first major title.
"Even if we play for nothing, we know that the atmosphere in Denver is going to be overcrowded, and the opposing team will be at their best in every area we're going to have to deal with this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter, but it looks like they're gonna let Scherzer throw.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, had a pitching session on Thursday and it looks like he'd be pitching Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has a 18-7 record with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's remarks in West Virginia
The president looked at the situation and referred to the situation with his own Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he was speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
He's one of the great -- I'm not a candidate, but, in fact, I am, and that's why I'm everywhere great candidates are running".
Trump added, "You can see the tremendous group of extremist Democrats, you can see what's happening right now.
And they do not hesitate to use whatever means are necessary to take away their power, their greed, their ego.
They don't care who they hurt, who they override to gain control and power, we're not going to give them that".
The Democrats, he said, are about "catching and obstructing".
He said, "As you've seen in the last four days, the Democrats are angry, they're prudent, they're disgusting, they're false.
He named the Democratic Party's current Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received a roar from the audience.
"Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, oh, no, I'm waiting for someone -- that's the wrong body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour will no longer have the upper hand.
It's intolerant of what they think and say.
When the activists from my local Momentum party voted against me, it wasn't a big surprise.
In fact, I'm the last one on the list of unwelcome Labour MPs -- just to say what we all thought.
My Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar manner for speaking out in favor of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security in Europe, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on all these issues.
The news report on Friday's East Nottingham meeting said, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings have been that.
Unfortunately, today, we have not been reminded of the word for "politics" as "pleasant, respectful", if it ever existed.
It's becoming clear that there are different views within the Labour Party and that there is a lot of judging about whether or not opinions are acceptable to the party leadership.
It all started when Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with the same political views as me started to take a 180-degree turn and demand that I adopt a viewpoint that I would never have agreed to -- both on national security and the UK single market.
Every time I've spoken in public -- no matter what I've said -- a bunch of comments on social media denouncing the central politics and demanding that I be removed from it, harassment, harassment, has happened from people who say I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
That's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the opinions that are thrown at me are usually political.
Every day I'm addicted to sexism and racism from people who have to deal with it professionally and honestly, but never shamefully.
One of the unpleasant things about modern politics is that the current level of harassment is being presented as normal.
Jeremy Corbyn, last week, said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we don't get a unanimous opinion on every motion of no confidence or when party rules get tighter.
Over the last two years, I've been getting a lot of messages telling me to keep my head down, to talk less, and then I'd be fine.
But I'm not in politics for that.
32 years ago, as a student, driven by the negligence of Thatcher's government, I left school and entered public service where I was most needed -- as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, not in the latest edition.
I'm sure no one in East Nottingham will doubt my political views and my disagreements with the current leadership.
I would say to those who have promoted Friday's motion that as this country moves towards a Brexit that will hurt our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand wasting time and energy on debating my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to promote Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether you're a Labour Party member or not: I'm very proud to work for you and I promise you that I will not be deterred from continuing to work for what is best in your interests by political threats or record keeping.
Chris Leslie is the MP for East Nottingham.
Ayr leads 38-17 Melrose, Ayr is still undefeated.
The last two surprising attempts somehow changed the final result, but without any doubt, Ayr deserved the win in the wonderful and fun Tennent Championship Day match.
They're the only team in the league that hasn't lost a game in 10 years.
They ended up with a better defense, they made better use of the opportunities, and the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be happy.
"They've tested us so far, and we haven't lost a single one, so we should be happy".
Robyn Christie of Melros added, "My respects go to Ayr, for they used their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, executed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but the yellow card issued to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, left by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to add points and Jason Baggot failed to execute the attempt.
Climo had previously stopped Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half, he had a solo practice and Ayr went 17-5 to the break.
But Melrose started the second half with a great start and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, performed by Baggot, cut the gap by five points.
Then there was a long hiatus due to the serious injury of player Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out on the crib and, upon his return to play Ayr went further when Stafford McDowall's practice was turned into a Clima.
Then Blair Macpherson, Ayr captain, was stripped of his yellow card and again Melrose benefited from being one more man with the failed Bruce Colvines rehearsal, which came to a quick end.
The home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson was given the yellow card to stop Climo from getting the ball from the penalty line, MacPherson, who was advancing, touched the ground behind the Ayr's goal.
Clima scored, as he had done almost from the start, as Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and knocked out Gregor Henry's wing in the fifth home rehearsal.
The star of the series "Still Game" embarks on a new career in the restaurant industry.
Actor Ford Kieran is looking to enter the hospitality industry after learning he's been made CEO of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he is co-writer and co-star of with long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the show will be ending next season, Season 9, and it seems that Kiernan is planning her life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has declined to comment on the story, although sources in the Scottish Sun magazine said he was keen to include Kiernan in a brand of Glasgow's leading restaurants.
'The sea is ours': Inner Bolivia hopes courts will reopen the way to the Pacific
The seamen's patrol, headquarters of the ship's equipment coverage, La Paz.
Public buildings have blue flags.
The ships sailing from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon can read on the decks: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to get it back".
Across inland Bolivia, the bloody 19th-century Chilean coastal conflict is still alive - with a renewed desire to sail the Pacific.
These hopes are perhaps stronger now than they have been in decades, because Bolivia is expecting on October 1st, after five years of deliberation, to see a decision by the international court.
"Bolivia is living in a good moment, with a sense of harmony and calm, and, of course, it is optimistic about the outcome", says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice through huge screens distributed throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will give the right to Bolivia's claims - after decades of negotiations - as Chile has been forced to negotiate over the issue of giving Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charming indigenous president - who is keenly involved in the race for re-election next year - has also made a number of contributions to Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said at the end of last August.
However, some analysts fear that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia and that, as a result, not much will change.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to hand over Chilean territory and has indicated it will not rule on the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision came six months after the end of the negotiations indicates that the case "wasn't difficult", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's cause, they've been backing off for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken as a prisoner by the present Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
He says that President Morales' belligerent rhetoric has destroyed all remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile still have a lot of issues to discuss, but it's going to be very difficult to continue the discussion after that.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with those who say the court's decision is particularly quick.
On Monday, Bolivia said it would have "a great opportunity to re-establish relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of discontent, for the good of both".
Calzadilla expressed his disagreement with those who say Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the sea issue to gain political support.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This decision is a chance we should have seen to get past it".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until the United States can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country is not disarmed until Washington can believe it.
Rik made that statement at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promise at the Singapore summit in the presence of the leaders of the rival nations.
This was made in the wake of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's more than three-month engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, which has seen nuclear diplomacy on the verge of re-blocking.
Rik calls it "utopian" to think that continued sanctions and U.S. intervention in the face of the Korean War's declaration of end will bring North Korea back to its feet.
Washington is reluctant to agree to a recognition before Pyongyang makes moves to lay down its arms.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there's a lot of skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about the apparent only way the country can guarantee its security is by denying all weapons.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to host the second summit between Kim and Trump.
On the Paris Fashion Show on your way to High Street next door, he's showing off his latest line of massive hats.
If you want to add to your hat collection or block out the sun completely, here's the answer.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of quirky large-size hats in the spring-summer 2019 collection, which shook the style displayed at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, some pretty un-practical hats have arrived on Instagram, and these designers have brought their own spectacular designs to the hallway.
Valentino's most notable piece, a beige hat with a feather-like wing, covered the heads of the models.
Among the other large accessories, we have a kind of jewel-lined eider, a rather strange hat, and even a kind of pine pine -- but they're not just mind-warming designs.
Thom Brown also showed off his collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have lips sewn on them that look more like Hannibal Lecter's than a high-end tailor's.
One looked like a diving mask with a tube and glasses, and the other was a little popcorn with melted ice cream.
If you're a fashion fan, you have good news.
Fashion experts say it's gonna be a lot of hate, even for the people around you.
The larger hats follow La Bomba, a straw hat with two-foot wide wings, which we've seen many celebrities wear, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impractical hat that has become a social media hit has taken another object to the corridor -- a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the bathing suit model wearing it.
The orange-rusty bag, cut with a rattan slit and finished with a white leather handle, has been the protagonist of Jacquemuse's Spring-Summer collection La Riviera 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said on FEMAIL, "I hope that big hats and big beach bags will hit the main streets next summer, with the sheer popularity the designer has had, it would be difficult to ignore the demand from accessory giants".
John Edward: Basic language skills for a global citizen
Independent schools in Scotland set records for academic excellence, and have continued in 2018, with outstanding test results, which were reinforced by outstanding individual and team results in sports, art, music and other community projects.
With 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, strive to provide the best possible service between students and their parents.
The purpose of independent schools is to prepare students for higher education, for their chosen career and as citizens.
Because we can design and implement a personalized school curriculum as an education sector, we have found that modern languages remain the most common choice for students.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
But if you speak to her in her language, you will reach her heart".
It's a powerful way of reminding us that to build relationships and gain trust with people in other countries, we don't have to use English alone.
We can see from the latest survey results this year that language is at the top of the list of achievements in independent schools.
68% of students studying foreign languages have achieved the highest A rating.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS students' schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved the best A rating in Mandarin Chinese; 72 percent in German; 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are definitely seeing foreign languages as a vital skill that young people and children will need in the future.
Languages are currently studied as core subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and others.
A survey by the EU Commission in 2014 found that one of the main reasons people were found to fill the job was lack of language skills.
Knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job options that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career path they choose, if they learn a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future and a real advantage for the rest of their lives.
Being able to talk to people in foreign countries will automatically put the Eleanese person at the top of the competition.
According to a survey of 4,000 adults in the UK by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any foreign language, enough to have a normal conversation, and for those who spoke only French, it went up to a two-digit figure, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in teaching languages to today's children.
Speaking more than one language, which is mostly used in economic development, will give your children more chances to find better jobs.
In Scotland, they are different according to the language they teach in schools.
Some students prefer more classical modern languages, and others look to 2020 for what seems to be important to the EBA, like Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a wide range of language options to learn in an independent school with teachers who are experts in the field.
The purpose of Independent Schools in Scotland is to prepare children and equip them to succeed in the future in diverse fields.
We cannot deny that, in a global business environment, where languages are essential to the future of a country, so that needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as a capacity for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer their opportunity, diversity and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
It has to be done right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut Monday against the Lakers in San Diego.
The fans' wait for the first-class star LeBron James to make his debut in Los Angeles is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Monday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James will play on a limited schedule.
After this week's training, James was asked about the Lakers' schedule for the six preseason games.
He said, "I don't need a preseason game to prepare me for this stage of my career".
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will kick off his rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five rallies Trump is planning for next week, and he'll visit several places with friends, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for the vote to confirm him for a seat on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the midterm elections, where Republicans risk losing control of Congress in November's general election.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's tour of West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online via YouTube.
It looks like Trump will be conducting this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, pending the confirmation of the Senate's vote to keep his nomination for the position for sexual misconduct while the FBI investigation continues.
But the main purpose of this rally tour is to help the Republicans win some votes in the November election.
So, Trump's campaign says the goal of the five rallies next week is to "revitalize volunteerism and help keep the Republicans in the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives".
"The Congress's counter-attack is of the utmost importance and the president will travel to as many states as possible during his campaign session", said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally today will allow supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won in 2016 by 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey of Virginia, who is on his trail.
It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to go there to help with the election campaign, says Simon Header, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA will try to stay in the team Sunday singles competition
After three one-sided sessions, it looks like Saturday afternoon's foursome got what this Ryder Cup was all about.
The key at the moment is a top-down sporting concept, in which the players believe, but not for other competitions.
So, what do you say is the right time?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so I think now is the time, in a way", said Jordan Spieth, after he made the field one day.
Obviously, Europe has a four-point lead out of the 12 in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind is not in their favor, and they need help, especially from Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been a key player from tie to green, and he's setting an example.
Those celebratory cries have grown louder as the rounds progress, and he's wrapped up the important putt, winning four all-squares, after Thomas lost two two after.
He celebrated with another scream similar to the putt he won in Game 15, signifying that the American team was not out of the competition.
"You have to get strong and focus on your game", Spieth said.
It's what's left of those guys.
18 holes to go.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, historic Ryder Cup players.
Four out of four of the most unusual but charming European couples have sworn to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't throw a bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, they avoided bogey on Friday afternoon, and on Friday night they missed the final nine.
That turn and the crowd's rush and the energy that came from it made it a Sunday matchup to be overcome and there was no more famous European player than Fleetwood and Molina to close out Europe's victory when the sun rises at Le Golf National.
You better be in separate holes together.
It's too early to talk about the great Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have accelerated Sergio Garcia's work, leading the fours, as he tied with Alex Noren.
They put a bogey and two doubles ahead of the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole that was never too close to beat.
But on Sunday, there was no one to help you get out of your hole.
The quartet was fascinated to see the pairs interacting up close, what advice they gave, what they didn't, and how you could change strategy in an instant.
Europe performed better as a team, and had a significant lead for the final, but the quartet showcased that the US team still has the courage to fight, although some, especially Stateside, questioned it.
Europe has a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe has a clear lead in the Ryder Cup final after Saturday's foursome 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molina scored two victories against the hard-hitting Tiger Woods, and secured their four most valuable points to date at Le Golf Nationale.
Europe's Thomas Bjorn, trying to regain the trophy Hazelin lost two years ago, dominated the morning, and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered the strongest resistance, and won two games, but they couldn't overcome the gap.
They needed eight points from Jim Fury in 12 games on Sunday to hold on to the trophy.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie to score four points in a row and along with Molinari, who after a great weekend are nicknamed "Molliwood", are second in the history of the Ryder Cup tournament with four points in four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed at the Fourball, he perfected the game by beating the tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by a 5-4 light.
Woods, after playing two games Saturday, showed a touch of brilliance, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome, seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for the morning's forball and returned with Henrik Stenson to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2&1 in the quarterfinals - the best in the world and third.
Europe could not find its way to Paris in the cool, cool days of the southwest.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans, two points, on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball and then beat even Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 foursomes after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to overcome the four-point margin and enter the singles, although Fury's side needed only a tie to retain the trophy.
Two days after he's second best, after the Sunday anti-clockwise, they'll be ahead of him.
North Korea has given a negative round to lay down its arms without any confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions continue to undermine the confidence of the United States and that under no circumstances will they stop developing nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the World Organization's Annual General Meeting, said that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, leaving nuclear test sites, and pledging to stop developing nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we see no appropriate response from the United States", he said.
"Without the trust of the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under no circumstances should we be the first to lay down our arms".
The family's North Korean complaint about the resistance of Rik Washington is repeated as part of a "phase" process of denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statements seem significant given that he did not rule out the unilateral denuclearization of Pyongyang in the past.
Rik Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump refer to the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, and Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first lay down its weapons.
Washington has ignored the international voices calling for easing sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States reiterates that it must first lay down its arms and continues to increase the pressure level of sanctions to force it to achieve its goal, and is opposed to the 'Declaration of the End of War'", Rik said.
"The idea that the rigors will bring us down is a utopia for those who don't know us.
The problem is that continued punishment is increasing distrust".
Rick made no mention of the second summit between Kim and Trump announced by the US leaders earlier this week at the UN.
The minister, however, mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side was South Korea instead of the United States, then denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be blocked".
However, the tone of Ri's speech would be completely different last year, when he stated at the UN General Assembly that North Korea was inevitably pointing missiles at the US, after President Trump called him "Mr. Kim" "missile" in a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who vowed to "destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but indicated that more work still needed to be done and that sanctions would continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for that, whether it was two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, "The sanctions of the Security Council must be continued, unfailingly, until we can prove that its denuclearization is genuine".
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to block Pyongyang's financing of its nuclear and ballistic programs.
Pompeo met with Riya outside the UN General Assembly and then announced he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July, saying that he had achieved nothing for North Korea, after hours of alleging that it was fulfilling the demands of gangsters".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon that they would give up their missile sites and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures.
He told Kim that the "measures they're looking for" were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students have done a course on getting enough rest.
This year at Harvard University, undergraduates will be getting more sleep as we try to counter the increasingly pervasive culture of coffee-drinking.
One professor saw that in the best university in the world, students are wasting a lot of money on basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the UK.
He started his course when he gave a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep during school.
'At the end, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why do I have to do this only now, in my last year of school?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important it is to sleep well, which surprised me, according to the Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students how proper sleep habits affect their study and sports performance, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services, stated that the university decided to launch the course after they noticed that students were sleeping less during the week.
The long-term course consists of several interactive chapters.
One section is a room image where students are pressing coffee pots, curtains, coaches, books to see the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance, and the importance of bedtime habits.
In another part, we explain to the participants that if they sleep too little, the risk of having a heart attack increases, and the risk of developing depression or cancer.
A campus map, using interactive icons, invites participants to reflect on their daily habits.
We know we can't change the student habits overnight.
But we think they have a right to know, just like you have a right to know what it will do to your health if you choose to smoke", Czeisler added.
There is still a culture of pride in gaupasa, he says, and the growing pressure on students and modern technology exacerbates the problem of under-performing.
Good sleep, good quality sleep, should be the secret Karma to dealing with stress, fatigue, and nervousness -- and to gaining weight, he said, because less sleep puts your brain in a hunger mode, and you'll be hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and had one of his first classes in his first year at Harvard.
He stated that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to participate in a course that was part of the campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask graduate students to do a parallel research before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm to tell them when to go to bed and when to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter their circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers, Mengaka defeats Gerrard's men and the Rangers are in the lead.
The Rangers have suffered another defeat with Dolly Menga's strike that put them 1-0 to Steven Gerrard at Livingston.
They were looking to win for the first time since Ibrox's 4-1 win over St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holte's team caused the Gerrards' second defeat in his 18th game as coach, leaving his eight points to slip out of control by the Landbrokes Championship-leading Hearts.
Menga kicked the strike seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' work failed to tie the game.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston have moved up to third, and are only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
The problem could have been more serious for the Rangers as Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury that he allegedly sustained after being hit by an object thrown from outside.
Gerrard made eight substitutions and helped Ayr reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was accompanied by Livi 11, who took a point off Hearts last week and would have been happy to see his well-tuned suit strangle his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers took possession, but Livingston benefited their players more.
A goal from Menga's wing Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor should have been scored but the midfielder failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free throw by Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to get him off the back row.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third, their game seemed to be more hopeful than believable.
Alfredo Morelos felt there should be a penalty at the end of the quarter when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeal.
He managed to make only two shots from the Rangers in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headed kick and Ovie Ejaria's light stroke.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have hurt the outcome of the game, but no one can deny that it was worth it, given the effort that was put in.
Once again the Rangers failed to stop a play that would stop Jacobs' ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard intervened at halftime by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the switch took effect immediately when the winger passed to Morelos, but the formidable Kelly ran over his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the outsiders to play their favorite game, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long after long passes.
Holt's team had a chance to increase their lead, but McGregor held firmly before making a head-butt from the Lithgow corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton again requested a penalty at the end when he got stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. This invention was followed by what is known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a landmark of science, and has become a landmark of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the unscientific cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms radiating from minerals".
Evans: "Yeah, it's playing right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize which cells are malignant as part of the treatment.
They're doing this by taking all the immune cells from the patient and then changing them in the lab.
And then they can look at a protein that's common in most cancers, and then re-inject it.
This vaccine that we're testing is showing very good results in patients with many different types of cancer.
In fact, a woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells, was able to prevent ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
What they do is they take all the immune cells from the patient, they alter them in the lab so that they can see a protein called HER2, which is common to many cancers, and then they re-inject the cells.
Jay Berzofsky at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a highly promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and figuring out how to get to the cancer cells has worked for one type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a pro-Trump rally wearing a MAG hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't work.
Kanye West was shouted into the studio on Saturday Night Live when he hailed President Donald Trump of the United States and announced that he would run for President again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, who was wearing a Make America Great hat, began to speak out against the Democrats and affirmed his pro-Trump stance.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they say, "How come you like Trump because he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago", he said.
The series began with a sketch starring Matt Damon on SNL, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's insulting speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock West was trying to make a mockery of itself by releasing it.
Plus, West publicly complained about how he had a bad time between the wings because of his hat.
"I've been caught between the wings.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on".
I was attacked!
And then they say I'm in a bad place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see where the bottom is?" and he said, "I'm going to wear my Superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love".
His words resulted in at least a couple of whistles from the audience and the members of the SNL show seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person present telling the magazine, "The whole studio fell into complete silence".
West was brought in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, who had just been murdered by her boyfriend, the rapper Rac Miller.
The web really impressed a lot of people with his rendition of I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits:
But as Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, tweeted, West was just "being who she is, and that's great".
"But I do NOT want to reward a person who adopts an ideology that is harmful to the community (by buying their music or clothes or protecting their art).
She's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that until now he was known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has also been named Snoop Lion, not to mention the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to an icon and made Prince the artist he was until then.
Charged with attempted murder in a stabbing attack at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is due to appear at the First District Court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewing the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, has come out against toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has defied the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that as a result of such roles on screen, young men often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In comments to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said he believed 'something has gone wrong' and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, also a star of Game of Thrones, who is 31 years old, and admitted that he is "convinced" that he needs to face the problem.
'I personally, and with great certainty at this point, think -- what have we done wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we been teaching men as they've grown up, given the problem we're seeing now?'
Kit believes that television may also be responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, as a result of the overly masculine characters.
He continued, 'What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to make this kind of manhood their own?
I think that's one of the most important issues of our time. How can we change that?
"For it is evident that something has gone wrong with the young men".
He also admitted in the interview that he will not be making a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said he's 'done with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's True West, a coming-of-age story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he feels meeting his wife Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has ever given him.
"I met my wife on this show, and she gave me my future family and a lifetime to come", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the woman loved by Jon Snow's character Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
China reports a 14% increase in new cases of HIV/AIDS
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are still affected, according to health officials.
More than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions in certain areas of China.
But in this way, the number of people infected with HIV was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year by year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has been rising by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem among the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
Many diseases are transmitted through sexual intercourse through the use of inappropriate protective clothing.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has mandated universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied the leaked GOP Senate data by her staff, and has been accused of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
Maxine Waters on Saturday alleged that a member of her staff had published personal information on three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles have pointed out that the confirmation was encouraged by "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites.
"More lies, lies and despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included information from three U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source was linked to Waters' office and published information from a member of Waters' staff, Hill said.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
"My staff members -- whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk as a result of these false fraud claims -- cannot accept any responsibility for the leakage of that information.
"Any unfounded allegation is totally false and utterly false".
Waters's comments were immediately met with online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This cancellation is a rash one", wrote Fleischer.
"This proves that he is unfit to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't show up angry.
He mustn't show any defiance.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and temperate".
It seemed that Fleischer was trying to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If the meaningful thing is true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his offices had been alerted "to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities with respect to these fraudulent statements.
"We make sure that the identity of the violators is revealed", he continued, "and they are held accountable to the law for any action that is harmful and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again is a parody of the low-powered spy Rowan Atkinson.
It has now become traditional to seek meaning for Brexit in any new film with a British twist, and this seems not to be applicable in the parody action-comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will satirizing ourselves on the issue that so clearly shows what a piece of crap we are create a new export opportunity for our nation?
Anyway, the big-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to screw things up for the second time: his name above all else indicates that he is merely a vast comic creation designed for territories where non-English-speaking cinema is seen.
Despite his peculiar desire for flattering glamour, he is a silly secret agent who looks a little like Clouseu, of course, but also a bit like Mr Bean and a bit like the guy who supports Chariots of Fire with a single note at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It's also based on the mysterious traveler and international man played by Atkinson in the Barclaycard TV commercials that we've forgotten about. It's also based on the mysterious man himself, leaving chaos behind.
There's a good moment or two on J.E.'s last trip.
What I liked most was how Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the rotor crosses hitting his head.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is visible on screen, but his sense of humor is lacking in force and is too superfluous, especially when even film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now incorporate comedy among their components.
The humor seems more directed at children than adults, and to me the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and intelligent as the Bean jokes in Atkinson's silent films.
The prevailing premise is that Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, exposing the identities of every British agent working there, and the agent on duty is disappointed.
That's too much for a prime minister with a pompous, haunted character who's already losing political prestige completely: Emma Thompson does her best in a character that's almost like Teresa May, but the script doesn't help much.
His intelligence advisers have informed him that with all his spy assets at risk, he will have to find someone who is retired.
And that means Johnny English himself is doing his best. He's now a teacher at a fancy place, but he's giving confidential classes on acting as a secret operative -- some great jokes out there, with English's "School of Rock" spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, where he meets his former partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost in that rich-man-style role.
So, in the Secret Service of His Majesty, Batman and Robin are back in action, making things miserable, and they meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova of Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being seduced by a tech billionaire who claims he can fix Britain's computer misfortunes.
English and Bough begin their farce adventures, disguised as waiters, setting fire to a French restaurant, creating chaos by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers complete anarchy when he tries to use his virtual reality helmets to go inside and see how Volta's house looks.
All the stops are looking at that last scene, and as fun and noisy as it is, it's got a lot of kids' TV in it.
That's so cool.
And as with many of my other Johnny English films, I thought, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that's worthy of her talent?
The Labour Party has denied that the British should work four days a week but are working on a plan to pay five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working one business day a week but getting paid five days a week.
It seems that the party wants the bosses to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them one more holiday.
The workers would have three days of weekends, but they would still take home the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits well with the party's economic agenda and he wants to turn the country on the workers.
The introduction of a four-day workweek has been endorsed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but the four-day work week coincides with the party's vision of re-orientating the economy towards the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the party to support such an idea, as the Green Party advocated a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration has yet to receive the full support of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party's spokesperson has been quoted as saying, 'The four-day work week is not party policy, and the party does not accept it.'
The shadow minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party's congress last week to state his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said, without hesitation, that the "faceless executives" and "speculators" should be removed from power in the public utility companies.
In addition, under the shadow minister's plan, the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive their full stake, as a Labour government may make deductions if it sees that there has been misconduct.
In addition, he confirmed that there were plans to include workers in the boards of companies and to create Inclusive Property Funds to give 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees, who could collect annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether or not the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the findings could lead to a Republican senator withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could learn that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"In my opinion, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said on the way to the hearing, I said, 'I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
So I called him after this happened, the allegation was made public, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He answered firmly, clearly, without hesitation".
Graham's vow, however, seems to be written on stone.
"I have made my determination regarding Brett Kavanaugh that he will also face charges of causing an explosion", he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it with the utmost firmness", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of his citations have not been verified.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changed".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, you'll be attending the Global Citizen Festival in New York City, an annual music event that brings together some incredible artists with a single mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its 17th year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to the Grand Plaza in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose, which is to end extreme poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen's Festival, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those who want to attend the concert must perform a number of tasks or "acts", such as sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or in any other useful way making a call to help raise awareness about the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what kind of success has Global Citizen achieved in the 12 years that remain to its mission?
Is a free concert an original idea to encourage people to take action, or is it just another case of what's called clicktivism, which is to make people feel like they're actually making a difference by signing up for an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its followers, pushing for various goals.
He says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce policies and commitments worth more than $37 trillion, policies and commitments that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or received.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world.
Among key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, "an association of UK-based investors and implementers committed to helping children develop their full potential".[31] It has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like yourself, we will make the social injustice of malnutrition history", said The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman, speaking publicly at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after carrying out more than 5,000 actions across the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced it would fund the Power of Nutrition project, which will help 5 million women and children through nutrition-related interventions.
In answer to the FAQ on the website, what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and difficult road, and we're going to fall and fail at times.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed, together stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will be among the performers at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the military as a "blockade" to slow down Russian energy exports.
If necessary, Washington could use its military to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has pointed out that Russia's relationship with Syria - which is obviously where the legitimate government is operating on demand - is just a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to negotiate energy, like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern heart of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And according to the officer, there are ways to handle it.
"The United States, with our military, has the ability to ensure that offshore lines are open, and if necessary, even block them, to ensure that their energy doesn't reach the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants at an event organized by the Consumers' Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that presents itself as the "voice of consumer energy" in the United States.
Washington compared its approaches to Russia and Iran, concluding that they were ultimately the same.
"The economic option we have with respect to Iran and Russia is, roughly, to take advantage of fuels and replace them", he said, referring to Russia as a fossil-fuel-dependent one-stop-shop economy.
The comments came as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to promote its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump calls the "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely driven by economic motives, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US's position has been negatively received by Germany, which has reiterated its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries, has called on the US to stay out of the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state blocks our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin after a recent meeting.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
While in the city council of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren commented on Donald Trump at the city hall, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted Friday, Warren said, "Clearly, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters don't think he should run for president in 2020.
Forty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run for president, according to a poll by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted for the nomination.
The poll shows more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names that have emerged in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talked about the post-traumatic stress disorder in Track Palin during the campaign of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he was drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"Because of what my son is going through, what he's going through when he returns, I feel identified with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the other families who are suffering the vulnerability that our soldiers bring with them when they return", she told the audience at a Donald Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "a significant issue", and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back changed, they come back stronger, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and members of the Air Force and all other members of the military have given to this country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault on a woman, including a statement of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Wasilla Police spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states, including D.C., support the impeachment of the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a new U.S. lawsuit that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a statement of friendship Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker, defying police, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the August suit against the federal government by the American Union for Civil Liberties, Grace v. Sessions, has not been released.
She claimed that she had been sexually abused by her partner "and members of her violent gang", but her July 20 asylum application was denied by U.S. officials.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state's lawyers who are protecting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate high numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as being countries with widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
"The new police force ignores years of state, federal and international law", said District Attorney Karl Racine in a statement Friday.
"Federal law states that all asylum requests must be assigned based on the particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such a bar violates that principle", the amicus curiae statement stated.
In addition, the lawyers argued in the brief that a policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide "necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of belonging to a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said when he presented the policy on June 11.
Asylum has never been a universal solution to all the problems that people face every day, even though the problems are serious.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while the number of dead has doubled, continue the race for survivors.
For those who survived, the situation became more and more critical.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was calming her son with fever in the devastated city of Palu.
"Ambulance arrives every minute.
It's clean water".
They've seen residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their flooded belongings, try to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, with broken back and shoulders, were placed outside the Palu Army Hospital to rest.
Tears were streaming from his eyes as he told how he felt the tremor of the earthquake when he was in his hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I just trampled on the ruins of the wall", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're all right".
US ambassador accuses China of propaganda attacks
After an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in an OIC newspaper promoting mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread his propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States of America, in his article in the Des Moines Register, the second best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, cited the paid surcharge last Wednesday after accusing China of attempted meddling in the November 6 US congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war in which each country has been putting a thorn in the side of the other's imports.
China's retaliatory spines at the beginning of the trade war, which supported Trump's Republican Party, were meant to attack exports from states like Iowa, Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and long-time governor of Iowa, one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad stated in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "China is now intensifying its attack by placing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the strong American tradition for a free press and press freedom by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, here in the press kiosk on the very street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's troubled economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers had avoided his offer to publish his article", but did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are turning away female voters ahead of the midterm elections with Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn.
With many top Republicans waiting to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a downturn, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
There's been a lot of excitement around this issue, and a majority of Republicans are registered to show they want to go ahead with the vote.
There's no going back on those things", said Grant Reeher, professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in reference to an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts whether pressure from Senator Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, to support an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow, and they won't forget in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters shouting "Come November!" were protesting outside the Senate building, and the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, he said on the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of place", said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
"People say it's already had an impact; that's true.
But it could have a much bigger impact, especially among women and young people in the suburbs who don't have a fixed vote, those between 18 and 29, considering that they often don't vote even if they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony against the Supreme Court nominee, which detailed sexual assault, analysts suggested that there might be a decline if the Republicans decided to continue with the confirmation.
"It's become a major stumbling block for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh should sit on the bench, it's about how the Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated the woman", Guy Cecil, the director of the group that helps elect Democrats, told news channel "Priorities USA".
Anyway, the American people seem to be pretty divided between the Ford and the Kavanaugh testimony when it comes to deciding which one to believe, but a lot more people seem to be choosing the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents said they either believed Ford's testimony or probably did, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony or probably did.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, he testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, while drunk, attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The man who invented the World Wide Web has plans to launch a new kind of Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is planning to start a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source Solid software platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea behind Inrupt was to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said, referring to the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data warehouse", or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music archives, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify: all of which are accessible in one browser, all at once.
The distinctive feature of an online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access a certain type of information.
They call it "empowering people with data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is this: to put the right resources, processes and capabilities to help make Solid work for everyone.
Right now, the people who make up the company are Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was bought by IBM, a couple of developers that were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about the need for a radical change when their business models are radically changing overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to put in place an ecosystem and commercial power that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network being built at Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the time of the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very, very optimistic about the next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann, World War I cleric honored with the Victoria Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have received the Victoria Cross as a World War I veteran has been honoured in his home country, 100 years later.
The honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the prize on September 29, 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never learned that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was displayed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" to present the stone to his grandfather and to display it 100 years later.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St Quentin Canal, in a tightly confined position and under constant fire from cannons and machine guns".
Then he rushed to the first line of fire, and with the greatest courage he led the line forward until he found a cannon all by himself and threw it down three of his hands.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said he knew what his grandfather did "he could never have done himself, but it's a lot of humility".
She and her brother, Dr. James Vann, installed a wreath after the parade, led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a great honour for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is proved by the support that so many people will give him".
The MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206 but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Let's say you stay up all night watching Bellator 206 and then you're not allowed to watch the main show.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights across six main schedules, and was scheduled to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the UK audience was stunned when the coverage shifted to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after staying up until the early hours of the morning to deliberately fight.
One follower described the change to Twitter's children's cartoons as a "bad joke".
"A government law said that this content was not appropriate by 6:00 a.m., and they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the show.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would be reviewing programming to accommodate UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I probably feel like we can fix it", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there, and we can't fix that until it's our Sunday, their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change was made, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and not everyone was very happy.
So we tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government matter.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're gonna play five fights instead of six, like we usually do, and we tried to give people more, and we screwed up.
"This is a situation that unfortunately will happen".
Tom Daley is "underrated" when it comes to sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling undervalued by others because of his sexuality, but that it gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it wasn't until he went to high school that he realized "that everyone wasn't like him".
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne of Radio 4, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him less focused on winning the Olympics.
Our longtime regular presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of sick leave.
After appearing completely lost in Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "less than everyone else" because society was not tolerant of liking boys and girls.
He said, "Until today, that feeling that makes you feel underestimated and different from everyone else has been the real reason that has empowered and empowered me to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was, as he put it, something, because he didn't want people to be disappointed when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT promoter, and used her participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She said she was speaking out because she felt she was lucky to be able to live openly without suffering consequences and she wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that her love affair with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "had taken her by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but he said that the age difference wasn't a problem between them.
She said, "When you're so young and you've been through so much -- she went to the Olympics for the first time at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later -- it's hard to find someone of your age who has gone through the same thing.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says that his "entire outlook" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I'd have been thinking about was, 'Do I want to win a gold medal?'" he said.
"And, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was tickets to the London 2012 Games, because he wanted to be on the front lines.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be able to be on the front lines, Dad", he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and I stopped breathing and I didn't accept until he died that he was no longer invincible", she said.
The next day, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, to stand in front of a local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", she said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Proud, by Heather Small - which made her feel identified throughout the entire process of preparing for the Olympic Games and still puts her on chicken-ass.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was not in shape, sat on the bench Saturday night at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson is set to break the record in his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he'll have to work on his form to make sure he doesn't look bad.
Mickelson was breaking the record for two years with his 12th appearance in a single event, but was sent to the bench by captain Jim Fury for Saturday's fourball and foursome.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major champion split his day between being a cheerleader and working on the field, hoping to correct what was hurting him.
He was never the most correct of drivers, even in the prime of his career, and the 48-year-old is not the best choice for the competitive dynamics of Le Golf National, where the toughest players take over the losers.
And while the field itself may not be scary enough, Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, will face British Open champion Francesco Molina, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, starting 12 games, are four points under, and they get off to a good start, Mickelson could be the deciding player.
Fury showed confidence in his man, for he could not say much more.
"He understood the role he had today so well, he slapped me on the back and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Fury said.
"He's very self-confident.
He's a top athlete and he's done a lot for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it happened, and we felt like we had to do it.
She wants to be there, like everyone else".
Mickelson is going to beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a Ryder Cup professional who never again reached his individual record.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 18 losses, and seven shutouts, yet according to Furyck, he's brought something untouchable to the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic and intelligent and he makes fun of people and it's great to have him around", she said.
"The young players have enjoyed playing against him this week, and it's been fun to watch.
He does more than just play".
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows that their huge advantage may soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that despite a huge lead in the final day's singles, the Ryder Cup could easily become an uncomfortable situation.
In 1997, the Danish made his debut at Valderrama, where his team under Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but narrowly won the championship with a score of 141⁄2 and 131⁄2.
"I constantly remind myself that we had a big lead at Valderrama and we barely won, and we lost at Brooklyn even though the lead was also big", said Bjorne (pictured), after the Class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, gaining a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history tells me and everyone in my team that this isn't over yet.
We'll show our best courage tomorrow.
We're going out on the field and we're going to try to do it right.
Nothing's decided until the points are on the board.
We're focused on winning the trophy.
As I've always said, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the other side, some of the best players in the world".
Pleased with the achievements of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorne also said: "I never want to put anything ahead of time.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.
Tomorrow's the singles, which is something else.
It's nice to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, every golfer has to show their full potential.
That's the message we want to send to the players.
Now, forget about your peers, they have to bring out their best too".
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Fury believes his players will do better than they would individually, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three of the four points.
Fury himself has been on both sides of those turning points in the last day, as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later losing to the European team, when the Europeans did what they called the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word he said", he said, when we asked the 1999 captain, Ben Crenshawk, how he cheered them on their final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to keep the lead from the start, like we did in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the other side has the advantage, there's a lot of pressure in those midterms.
We've made the decision based on that roster, and we hope we'll do a great job tomorrow".
Thomas is the counterattacker, and Rory McIlroy will face him in the final match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I chose this group in that order because they can go all the way", Bjorne said of the individuals chosen.
The construction of the new German battleship has been delayed again.
The new German Navy frigate was to be ordered in 2014 to replace older Cold War-era warships, but will not be built until at least next year due to defective systems and rising costs, according to local media.
The order for the battleship "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cited a military spokesman.
The ship was to be commissioned in 2014, but eleven problems after delivery prevented the completion of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen class frigates.
It is believed that a powerful cannon will have anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile characteristics and technology for carrying out covert actions (e.g. reduced radar, and infrared and acoustic signatures).
It will also have longer maintenance capacities: the newest frigates can stay up to two years outside their original ports.
However, due to continued delays, the cutting-edge warships (which Germany aims to project its power) will be obsolete by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate caused a lot of media buzz last year when the German military officially rejected the order for the ship, and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had ever returned a ship to the shipyard after delivering it.
The reasons for the transfer are unknown, but German media reported "serious software and hardware flaws that would render the warship unusable if used in combat missions".
Particularly significant were software flaws, the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by 120 sailors, i.e. half of those on the Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship is overweight and, as a result, its performance is greatly reduced, making it more difficult for the navy to add innovations in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by Germany during World War II.
As well as the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also a problem.
It is estimated to cost €3.1 billion, up from €2.200 million.
The problems with the new frigates are even more serious in the face of warnings that the German navy is reducing its capacity.
A few months ago, the chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the navy's useful ships are running out.
The deputy said the problem was exacerbated by the lack of replacement ships after the old ones were retired.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate had ever entered the navy.
The Secret Life of Bats by the National Trust
A recent study in a remote hill country in Scotland explores how bats use the landscape to find food.
They hope that more information will be available about the behaviour of these special flying mammals, so that future actions to protect them can be better defined.
The research, being carried out by scientists from the Scottish National Trust (NTS), will follow the common and soprano dwarf bats, as well as the large-eared and Daubenton bat, at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations, and the bat's activities will be monitored throughout the season.
UK NHS staff will also conduct mobile drilling with handheld detectors.
When experts analyze the sound of all the recorders, they can tell us how often the bats call, and what each species does.
The habitat is then mapped and reported to obtain a detailed landscape-scale picture of the bats' behavior.
According to Rob Dewar, conservation consultant at NTS, the issue will be determining which areas are the most important habitats for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will be used to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to best maintain forests for bats and related species.
The bat population in Scotland, as well as the rest of the UK, declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects their nests and loss of habitat.
The problem is that the human body is not able to control its own actions.
Bats are not really blind.
However, they hunt mostly at night, and their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to detect bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
The NTS is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres in Scotland, and takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct observations, nest inspections and, occasionally, rescue operations.
In fact, the organisation has created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to the site manager, David Thompson, the plot is ideal for them.
"We have a great bat sanctuary in Threave", he said.
"We have old buildings and old trees, making it a perfect habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so with the work we're doing here and on other farms, we're going to understand what they need to stay healthy".
Thompson has stated that it is very important to check for bats before any maintenance work is done on the property, as accidentally destroying a single breeding nest could kill 400 female bats and cubs, and possibly potentially cause the entire local population to disappear.
And they're not going to be able to get away with it. They're going to be able to get away with it.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Bat Conservation Society, has appealed to the general population for help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how they behave with many of the species that live with us".
Ronaldo has dismissed the rape charges while his lawyers rush to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the allegations of rape against him are fake news, and that those who did it are just trying to get publicity by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaint.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker, an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, has been accused of raping a woman in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the accusation was released, he made a live Instagram video for the 33-year-old Ronaldo's 142 million followers on the platform, in which he called the accusations "fake news".
"No, no, no, no and no.
What you said today is fake news, said in front of the cameras a five-time Golden Ball winner.
They're trying to get publicity using my name.
It's not unusual.
They're trying to make a name for themselves by saying my name, but that's what happens in my profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything is fine", said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel in the face of allegations that it is an unacceptable publication of suspicions of privacy violations.
"Christian Schertz, our attorney, said that the player will seek damages "in light of the seriousness of the missile, "which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's bedroom where he allegedly raped her through the corners, according to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The Mayor stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident, and said that 99% of the time he was a good man, but 1% of the time he was wrong".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confessed that the couple had sexual relations, but that the relationship was permissive.
Mayorga herself said that she went to the police, took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later reached an out-of-court settlement because she was terrified of reprisals, and worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman said she wants to cancel the deal because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was in the process of transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and last summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a deal worth €100 million.
The UK will forever regret losing its car manufacturers.
The UK will forever regret its decision to leave the top position in the world of car manufacturing after Brexit, said UK Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He also said it was "disgusting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would stop production at its factory in Burnstone, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker has said that delays in customs due to a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"We believe that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other UK carmakers (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concern for carmakers is the risks to their supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is in the current state of repair, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the European Union for cars built on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border disruptions and delays and parts shortages.
It would not be possible for Toyota to store inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire factory; as a result, production would have to be halted.
"Clark said Theresa May's 'Chequers' plan for the future relationship with the EU is 'specifically designed to avoid these customs checks.'"
"We need to make a deal, we want the best deal possible, not just to ensure success now, but to take advantage of this opportunity in the future", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Other than Toyota, manufacturers have proven that it is essential that even highly successful supply chains remain intact".
Toyota could not say how long the production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and, consequently, the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnstone for 24 years and is the factory coordinator for the Unite union, says his colleagues are increasingly worried: "I know from experience that if we lose these jobs, we will never get them back".
A government spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
The White House says the Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again.
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed another week as the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence in the U.S. election, the Russian-Trump associates' connection to the president, and the president's alleged obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump's firing of the acting attorney general would jeopardize Mueller's independence has been a hot topic of discussion in Washington over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered using a hidden microphone to record his conversations with Trump, and removing the president from office under Article 25 of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
And yet, he visited the White House last Monday, when rumors surfaced that he was resigning.
Instead, he announced that he would meet with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York, on Thursday.
Trump has said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump's request for a week-long investigation to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh led to further delay of the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about his meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There's no date set yet; it might be this week, but I would understand if it was postponed to another week, given everything that's going on at the Supreme Court.
We'll see, though; I always like to keep the press informed".
Some reporters may disagree with this statement, as Sanders has not given a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked him why he was doing it.
What Sanders said about the press conference was not that the TV reporters are "over-exaggerated", but he said, "I agree that they are over-exaggerated".
Then he suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press would be enhanced.
"The president is doing far more Q&A sessions than any of his predecessors", he said, and he added, without mentioning the evidence, "We've verified these statistics".
Sanders said they'll continue to hold press conferences, but if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States questions in person, that's much better than asking me.
We've been trying to do that a lot, and you've seen we've done that a lot in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conference when we get to talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House, during opening sessions, or during press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
He doesn't usually do his own press conferences.
The possible reason for this was revealed by the President of the United States this week in New York City, when he made a spontaneous and sometimes strange appearance to a gathering of reporters.
The UK's health secretary has sent a letter to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS, in response to concerns about Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS health system, thanking them on behalf of the whole country, and asking them to stay after Brexit.
The letter, which describes the UK's exit from the European Union in less than six months, was written by the Scottish MP Jeane Freeman.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the cost of EU citizens working in public services claiming settled status.
Freeman said in his letter: "Over the summer, Brexit negotiations have progressed between the UK and the EU, and a decision is expected by autumn.
However, the UK government has stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this is a very stressful time for all of you.
So I want to emphasize that I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues in the EU, as well as from outside, bring valuable experience and skills to improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
"Scotland is your home without a doubt, "and we hope you will stay with us for the rest of your life".
Christion Abercrombie is in emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, running back for the Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury following Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
According to Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed, the player suffered a head injury just before halftime.
"The side airplane has collapsed and lost consciousness", says Reed.
Abercrombie has been oxygenated on the spot by the coaches and medical staff and is being carried on a stretcher for further medical examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State team told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that he's out of surgery and is in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that no details have been released about the type of injury or the severity of the injury, and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
He is in his second year with the Abercrombie Red Shirts, and is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles before leaving the game on Saturday, a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when they buy property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bell tax when they buy property in the UK, and this additional amount will be used to help those who have become homeless, according to the Conservative Party's plans.
The strategy is aimed at neutralizing Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in the bell tax will be for those who don't pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury estimates they'll raise an additional £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher toll tax when they buy property in the UK, and the additional amount will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
This strategy is aimed at neutralizing Corbyn's success in attracting young voters, with his promise to provide affordable housing and to collect more taxes for those with higher incomes.
The increased toll tax will be for individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional amount collected will be used by the government in its efforts to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the tax on the current bell (including the top-tier taxes for second homes entered two years ago and properties purchased for rent), can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury estimates that they will raise an additional £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the built-up properties in London are purchased by non-residents of the UK; as a result, prices rise and it becomes more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
The country's affluent areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns, as foreign buyers tend to spend most of their time outside the city.
This new policy comes after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the bell tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of buying land and leaving it unused to keep property prices high, and he asked May to abandon the quota for affordable housing in order to solve Britain's housing crisis.
Corbyn, for his part, has introduced some attractive housing reforms, including rent control and unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give the municipalities more powers to build more housing.
May said, "I said last year that I would dedicate my presidency to restoring the British dream, to improving the lives of each new generation.
That means fixing the corrupt housing market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who wish to live, work and make their own way here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for British residents who work hard for foreign companies to buy housing as it is for people who do not live in the UK and for British residents who work hard for foreign companies to buy housing.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far gone, and the shortage of people sleeping on the streets is still there".
Jack Ross: "It is my greatest desire to coach Scotland".
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, says his greatest dream is to coach the Scottish national team one day.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the north-eastern club, which is third in League One, three points behind first place.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I won a B League trophy, and that was it, Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I used to watch the Scottish games in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and I always wanted to come back.
However, I only had the ability to manage the club.
Among those who have coached Sunderland before Ross are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic has said he felt no nervousness about coming after such big names; he had previously turned down offers to coach Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To measure success, I must ask myself, 'Can I get the club back into the Premier League?'
Given the club's structure and facilities, it should be in the Premier League, without a doubt", he said.
"It's not going to be easy to get there, but I won't see myself as successful if I don't get there".
Ross has been coaching for just three years, having spent time as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a member of the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and it was also thanks to him that St Mirre went from being on the verge of relegation to championship status the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Maybe it was a real crossroads for me", he said about taking over for Alloa.
"I honestly thought I was better suited to a career as a coach than a player.
It's funny that I say that because I was a good player, I made a living, and I had some big moments of fame.
But playing can be tough.
You're going through a lot every week.
I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but I'm happy as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever on my own skin".
The interview will be broadcast in its entirety on Radio Scotland's Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, 12:00-13:00 (BST).
Saturday at 5:30 is the best time to have a drink, according to a recent survey.
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of pubs in Britain, but it has added pressure on the restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent, while restaurants fell 4.8 percent, according to the data.
Peter Martin, who works in CGA business consultancy and has collected the data, says: "With the sun continuing to shine, and the England team lasting longer than expected at the World Cup, the data for July is similar to that of June, where pub revenues rose 2.8 per cent, but restaurant revenues fell even further.
Although the restaurant sales in June fell 1.8 percent, they were even worse in July.
Drinks-specialized pubs and bars have fared much better, and their sales have risen more than the fall in restaurant sales.
Food bars have also suffered from the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Apparently, people just want a drink.
"The pub and bar drinks sales have risen 6.6 percent in the past month, while the food sales have fallen 3 percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since late April.
Weather and the influence of social and sporting events are the most important factors in terms of outdoor retail sales.
It's not surprising that restaurant chains are in financial trouble, and a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will cause significant damage, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer comes at a perfectly bad time for food establishments, and it remains to be seen whether the moderate temperatures of August will give them any relief".
Sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, rose 2.7 percent in July, with the expansion of chains slowing.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Index tracks sector sales for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK by collecting and analysing performance data from 47 operator groups, which together have revenues of over £9 billion.[1] The index is considered the benchmark for the sector.

This study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Managers' Conference (HMC) in the UK has revealed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, says, "It's a worrying temptation for teenagers to create secret online spaces that parents and teachers can't access".
Eilidh Doyle will be the Athletes' Spokesperson at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as the new CEO of the Scottish Athletic Council at this year's general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and Director Ian Beattie says this change is a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to draw on his vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has tremendous respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we know that it will be very valuable for Scottish athletics to have her on the board", Beatti said.
Doyle said this, "I'm looking forward to being the spokesperson for athletes, and I hope to make a big contribution to the future of sport in Scotland".
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and has a total of four gold medals.[1] He is currently a presenter for the BBC.[2] He recently lost the ability to walk due to a transient ischemic infarction.[3]
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
They said they were gonna see if I recovered, or how much.
It was really hard, but I've completely recovered, so I've had to learn to walk again, and I've been doing a lot of skill exercises today.
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
An ad for a dairy comparing mothers to cows has sparked mixed reactions on the Internet.
They are not the same as the animals. They are the same as the animals.
In celebration of the launch of what is being billed as the world's first silent portable milk extractor, consumer technology company Elvie has released a joke ad inspired by a music video to show the freedom the new device gives to milk extractors.
Four women who are really mothers are dancing in a haystack, with words like, "Yeah, I'm milking, but I don't stick", and "You may not have noticed, but these aren't straps, these are my tits".
This is the motto, "Screw milk, screw milk, feed the babies, screw milk, screw milk, I'm breastfeeding my girls".
However, this announcement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated a variety of reactions among viewers who have said they are not taking the dairy industry's "abominations" seriously.
"Using cows to advertise this product has been a very bad decision.
"They have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but they steal their young a few days after they're born", said one user.
The Elvie milk extractor can be inserted discreetly into one of the breasts.
Someone else said, "Of course, very traumatic for mother and child.
But, well, why not use it as a marketing tool for a milkshake for mothers who don't abort?"
Someone else added: "This ad is most unkind".
"Some people, however, have defended the ad, and one woman confessed that she found it "a real bummer".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I was milked.
The ad is a little crazy, but that's what it's all about.
It's a great product", one user wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad, directed at the milk-producing embryos (which they often have to do in workplaces or toilets), who feel like they're 'cows'".
It's not about praising or judging the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women show that they have a milkshake on their bras and that they have been dancing.
The campaign acknowledges that many women who milk feel like cows.
The Elvie milk extractor, however, is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and can be carried discreetly in one of the tin-plate bras, so that women can move around as they wish, carrying babies in their arms or going outdoors.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative executive director of Mother, commented: "Elvie's milk extractor is a very revolutionary product, and therefore required a bold and provocative introduction.
With this parity between milk-producing women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the process of milk-producing and the challenges that come with it, and to show the freedom of milk-producing in a fun and intimate way.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milkshake has garnered attention.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while she wore the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been smuggled into a camp near the Texas border.
The number of admitted migrant children has increased dramatically in recent times, despite roughly the same menstrual care at the border, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and guidelines have made it harder to get babies into foster care.
Until now, undocumented immigrants have been the main sponsors, but now they're afraid to sign up for child protection because they might lose their ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities said that those who wanted to be sponsors and other adults living in their homes would be required to send in their fingerprints, and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, an immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that dozens of people had been arrested for demanding protection for unauthorized minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of them had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who live with or with the sponsors are in our country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still tracking them", said Albence.
To speed up the process of the children's situation, officials have created a new set of rules that require children to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the 60 days that shelter workers used to say.
Many of them are scheduled to appear on a video conference call to ask an immigration judge for legal status.
If they are deemed unfit for assistance, they will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in care centers, the more likely they are to experience increased anxiety and depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to shelter staff and system reports over the past few months.
Child advocates say that these concerns are exacerbated in large facilities like Tornillo, which is so large that it is more likely that children's problems are overlooked.
They also said that if babies are taken to a campsite to prepare emotionally or without time to say goodbye to friends, it can exacerbate the trauma they already have.
The US, France and Turkey have asked the occupying forces to withdraw immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war in the country entered its eighth year.
The Deputy Prime Minister Moualem said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be treated as appropriate.
"They must be evacuated immediately and unconditionally", he said in the committee.
Moualem said the war on terror in Syria is almost over, with 360,000 people killed in the war since 2011 and millions displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight the "holy battle" until we clear all territory in Syria of terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The US has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualeb said that the conditions are right for their return, and accused some Western countries of promoting an "irrational fear" that encourages refugees to stay out.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow these returns", he said.
"The only humanitarian issue is being politicized".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no assistance to Syria's reconstruction until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
Recently, Russia and Turkey reached an agreement to establish a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold in Idlib, which UN diplomats say could lead to a political dialogue.
This agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack that allowed Russian-backed Syrian forces to attack the three million-strong province of Syria.
However, Moualeb said the deal has clear "limitations" and indicated that military action will target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who will be "destroyed".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes that the first meetings of the new assembly will soon be held between members of the government and the opposition to begin the drafting of a post-war constitution and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the meeting, saying that the work of the assembly should be limited to reviewing articles of the constitution of Jun, and warning that no one else should be involved.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will win reelection in 2020 unless (as many Democratic Party viewers probably expect) a impeachment process or scandals end before he needs to be president.
That would be the most dramatic end to a presidency".
So far, the audience doesn't seem tired.
Since 2014, the viewership of the prime-time CNN has nearly doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC has tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News, for its part, has 2.4 million viewers in that time slot, up 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen data. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the highest viewership on cable television, with up to 3.5 million viewers on nights when major news events have taken place.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we want to understand what's going on", says Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designated Survivor".
Nell Scovell, the experienced comedy scriptwriter and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Before the 2016 election, in a taxi in Boston,
The driver told her she was voting for Trump.
Scovell asked him why.
"Because it made him laugh", Scovell said.
There's time for entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, like nothing else on television, the stories coming out of Washington about the future of abortion laws, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the health of the global economy.
Only privileged viewers can disconnect.
However, it goes beyond being informed if you spend six hours watching an expert debate on a wide range of topics, from how Bob Woodward used deep precedents to write his book Fear, to Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (a garment full of scars according to The Washington Post), to Stormy Daniels's quirky portrayal of Trump's anatomy.
At least I'm never gonna look at Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, says of the changing characters and themes of Trump's show (debating the National Football League, praising Kim Jong-un): "It feels like a reality show, because it gives you something to consume every day.
You can't miss any sections, or you'll be left behind.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees and it was sunny in his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't help watching TV, especially now that Brett Kavanaugh is due to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
"Back in the day, when I was doing those weird TV shows, people were saying it was the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right.

Foreign money is pouring in to the most unequal midterm elections to the U.S. Congress.
It's no surprise that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, because congressional districts have been reorganized, resulting in two incumbents vying for the same seat.
The newly redrawn district around Pittsburgh is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election in another district.
Another incumbent is his rival Lamb, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps substantially with the 17th.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that district boundaries were being manipulated in favor of Republicans contrary to the Constitution, and as a result, the boundaries of the map were properly delineated.
This contest for the new 17th district has resulted in intense competition for campaign funding at the main sources of party funding: the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvania when he narrowly won the March 18 special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for the past decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political pundits say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for its support of China, but later reversed its decision.
Diplomats say the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized the agreement with Beijing, with Washington barely asking them to back down.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and was the owner of a hotel in Panama until his partners decided to fire the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, following the recent decision to withdraw recognition of Taiwan, Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, among other things to control drug trafficking, promote development and support the economy.
Among the sanctions proposed are a cut in economic aid and a temporary visa waiver, which would be extremely damaging to the Central American country, given its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, intended to be a follow-up to a similar meeting held the previous year, and was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from fleeing to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted to hold a conference, thus giving the impression that consideration of imposing sanctions on El Salvador had been dropped.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend the conference, which has been moved to mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats say.
Three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a message or a sanction from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on details of the discussion given by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to report on the internal discussions in exchange for anonymity.
An analyst close to the administration who spoke anonymously confirmed their claims.
Learn the history
The report by Attorney General Robert Mueller, which will soon be released, will reveal whether Trump obstructed justice, as there is ample evidence that is publicly available.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Russia was involved in the Trump campaign's attack on the US election.
If the majority in Congress changes sides, Trump will have to give him instructions as he prepares to appear before voters again (and possibly, someday, a jury of his peers).
There are many conditions for this, however, and I'm not saying that Trump's collapse is inevitable, or that Trump's European counterpart is.
We face decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine how long this conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western countries would stand up and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to prevent the slaughter that would follow.
History is full of such turning points, which inevitably accelerate or delay the progress of democracy.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points right now.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is the very person who controls the outcome of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's job has been in jeopardy since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly filming the president, and that he had declared the president unfit for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times's coverage is incorrect.
"What are we going to do if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is complete or unfair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice despite credible accusations of sexual assault and perjury against him?"
And most importantly, will we vote in midterm elections to form a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be a cold winter for democracy.
But I really think we can overcome them, based on the lesson I had in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the place where my embassy is.
He survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he had a swastika drawn on his desk and asked me to light a Sabbath candle.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is feeling optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna.
Rapid will host Vienna Rangers on Thursday, who know that if they beat the Austrians after their exciting draw with Spain's Villarreal a few weeks ago, they will be in a perfect position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans missed his first appearance of the season due to a knee injury until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but believes he can use that as a springboard for the Rangers to get better.
"It was a good result, because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
"We played with the hope of a point, and we ended up with a point.
We might have had a chance to win at the end, but it's a draw, I guess.
They dominated the first half, and then we dominated the second.
Thursday night is going to be a big game for the European championship.
We're hoping to get three points, but it's going to be difficult, because they did well in the last game, but we have the fans on our side, and I'm confident we'll move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, I had injuries and there were some changes in the club itself, but there's a positive atmosphere at the moment.
The team is good, the guys are having fun, the training is good.
I'm confident we'll move on, forget about last season and try to make it happen".
There's this issue that women are really worried about -- this issue of their retirement savings.
The people in the survey knew what kind of care they wanted, but very few had told their family members about it.
Half of those surveyed by Nationwide said they've talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have talked about it with their children.
"We want a family member to wait, but we don't dare ask", explained Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Insurance.
Here's the first step.
Talk to your spouse and children. The family won't be willing to take care of you unless you ask them first.
Work with your counselor and family to agree on where and how you want to receive care because the cost of care will depend on those choices.
Get help from a counselor who can help you find ways to cover these expenses.
You have several options for financing long-term care, including the standard long-term care insurance, a hybrid insurance that allows you to pay for your care in cash, and a cash-only insurance that you can pay for with your own money if you have the money.
Clean up the legal paperwork, forget the legal disputes.
Choose a trusted person to take care of your health care; also, make sure you get the care you want if you can't afford to be taken care of by a professional.
Also, get a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Find someone you trust to make financial choices on your behalf and, when you are unable to do so, to make sure you pay your bills.
Don't forget the details: say you have elderly parents, and one of them has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer any questions about any medications or allergies?
Write those details down in a written plan so you're ready.
"Finances are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are your medications?
Who's gonna watch the dog?

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and officials say the death toll could rise.
Because communications systems are cut off, rescue workers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala government, the area closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, north of Palo.
Please, over 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here's some important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala government on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island; in 2017, its population was about 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a governmental entity that covers an area of more than 300 km (180 mi) that makes up the northwest coast of Sulawesi island.
The government, which is an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi province is based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast across from Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, Paluk and Donggala have suffered numerous tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, and is therefore prone to earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake struck off the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia, north of Sumatra, causing a tsunami that shook 14 countries, and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Between late March and early April, several powerful earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake occurred in southern Java (Indonesia's most populous island), causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the southern province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake in Aceh's Pidie Jaya governorate brought disaster and fear, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but over 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Several large earthquakes occurred on the tourist-favored island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice in a domestic violence case and resisting authority, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a well-known woman started calling the police to report a suspected crime, Palin took her phone.
According to KTUU, he's in Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility in Palin, where he's in pre-trial detention and on $500 bail.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and, in his defense, unquestioningly maintained his innocence, as the net had made it known.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, and faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Palin, was charged with assault.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of a domestic violence charge, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend testified that he punched him in the face.
When his son's aggressive behavior was linked to the imbalance of post-traumatic stress caused by the Iraq experience, he received harsh criticism from Sarah Palin in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds of people
At least 384 people have died after a devastating earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, destroying thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are still down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the centre of Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media of the moment of impact.
In fact, a beach festival in Palu City was attended by hundreds of people when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecution wants a special death sentence for the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
The New York State Attorney General's Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, the last time a federal sentence was imposed for a crime in the state since 1953.
It is believed that 30-year-old Saipov used a rented truck from Home Depot for his attack on the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, in that October attack, he took out all pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, the prosecution will have to prove that Saipov killed those eight people and injured several people seriously, according to a notice of intent for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the legal documents, the death penalty would be possible in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for organized crime, which the federal prosecution uses in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction by motor vehicle.
The prosecution said the attack must have been "pre-planned" and "cruel" as Saipov described it.
The actions of Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been over a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was then charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was handed down in a New York case was in 1953, when it was handed down to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to commit espionage against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, Saipov of Uzbekistan showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he didn't feel guilty about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
He also, according to the police, requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of criminal mischief.
David Patton, who is one of the federal public defenders responsible for replacing Saipov, said they were "deeply disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that instead of accepting a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, your decision to seek the death penalty will only prolong the trauma of the people affected by these events", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should take over the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has ordered the mobilisation of the people's army in protest at the Conservative Party conference today.
The former UKIP leader has said that politicians should feel the heat of Euroscepticism, and Theresa May's MPs have proposed him to take over the negotiations with the UK.
Conservative MP Peter Bone explained to the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would have been "out of the loop" if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the Remain Conservatives have staged a Brexit protest in the city, and Mrs May has highlighted the challenge she faces: reconciling the completely divided ranks.
Prime Minister Chequers is trying to keep his compromise plan going, but he's been under attack from pro-Brexit, pro-Remain and EU.
The Allies expect that he will go ahead and try to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the reactions, and force the euro-sceptics and the peasants to choose between his offer or chaos.
Mr. Bone explained to the participants of the Leave Means Leave group's demonstration in Solihulle that he wants to release Chequers.
He also expressed his desire to work closely with Mr. Farage and to entrust him with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was, we'd be out of here by now", he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must fire Chequers".
He stated his opposition to the EBRK as follows: "We did not fight in the world wars to serve anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, saying that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay was a lie.
The Conservative Party's Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also joined the march, and she explained to reporters: "I'm just saying this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular among the people, the opposition will not vote for him, not popular among our party members, not even among our activists who are rocking the streets and making it possible for us to win the elections.
Stop checking out Chequers and start listening.
Addressing Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers, to keep their jobs, must keep their word.
Mr. Farage told the demonstrators that politicians should be made to feel the heat if they are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray the Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that we're not going to let them get away with it.
Addressing the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to feel the warmth of our political class who are about to betray the Brexit.
We are mobilizing the army of the people who gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until the UK becomes independent and self-governing and proud of it.
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
A handful of activists held up anti-Brexit signs after a group lunch this weekend.
His Labour colleague Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives over the security problems they had with the party's application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that ICT systems can make them work properly, and he added the whole technology of the Canada plus plus chain in Ireland, of frictionless, borderless, borderless free trade".
That's a lie.
There is no good Brexit, he added.
Warren will be considering his candidacy very carefully.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will carefully consider running for president after the November election.
As reported by The Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the Western Massachusetts City Council meeting on Saturday.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, defeating Republican state representative Geoff Diehl; Diehl was vice president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Rumor has it that he might take Trump's place in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting that Trump has held with his council members since taking office as a full council meeting.
One of the participants asked him if he had any plans to become president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and to do that, a woman had to be in charge.
A suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of Sims at Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a news conference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
Earlier, he had posted a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying a man.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the South Campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately resulted in his death", police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the Saturday newspaper via the 247sports network.
Wayde got into a fight trying to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated, and he admitted to being on the scene, holding a gun in his hand, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-two Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 10-star games last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world title on team orders after beating Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would be life and death in the race.
From the start, Bottas performed brilliantly, almost sacking Hamilton to defend his place in the first two rounds, and inviting his teammate to attack Vettel.
Vettel entered the pits first, and Hamilton had to enter the traffic at the end of the peloton, which should have had a direct impact on the race.
Mercedes entered the pits a lap later, and left behind Vettel, but after one race Hamilton took the lead; in the race, he had left the interior free by the Ferrari driver, to hold his position, after making a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started the race in the back row of the starting grid, and finished seventh in his first lap.
He then held the lead for most of the race, and by the end, he held onto the tyres to finish the race quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkon to take fourth place.
He finally entered the boxing ring on lap 44, but was unable to live up to the rhythm in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's not an easy day, but Valtteri has done a great job all weekend, and he's been really honest.
"The team did a great job in the qualifying round", said Hamilton.
Those were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, false, and liars".
"The only thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that's been happening in the Senate these last few days, is that you see the anger, you see people who are angry, you see people who are evil and deceitful and liars", he said.
You see the stories and the leaks and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me".
It wasn't me.
You remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Do you remember what he said?
Oh, no, you know what?
I didn't leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't, he added, imitating the senator's reaction.
A letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh sent by Ford to Feinstein last July was leaked last September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred in his office.
"I have not withheld any allegations by Dr. Ford, I have not leaked his story", Feinstein explained to the committee, according to a report in The Hill.
He asked me to keep it quiet, and I kept it quiet, as he asked.
But his denial was not welcomed by the president, who stated the following during the march on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what: those were inappropriate gestures.
Maybe it wasn't him, but they were the most inappropriate gestures I've ever seen.
Following the defense of the Supreme Court nominee who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said that the Democrats are using the allegations for their own ends.
They're willing to do anything to regain power.
They're bad, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, the president said, according to a report by Mediaite.
The elite league is Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars recovered on Saturday from their Elite League game against the Belfast Giants on Friday, winning 5-3 in a second-choice game at Dundee.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the game to a tie, but the Giants quickly regained the lead.
Francois Bouchard brought the tie back to Dundee, and in the end, Lukas Lundvald Nielsen was guaranteed a two-goal victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's boys, who lost 2-1 to Dundee in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants won their last three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to the assistance of Kendall McFaull, and, four minutes later, David Rutherford helped Beauvillier, who doubled the score.
It was a strong start, as Sullivan brought the tie down at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie score at 15:16.
Dwyer wanted to make sure the Giants reached the first half with the score in his favor, and, at the end of the first half, he scored his second goal of the night.
But the hosts reorganized and Bouchard brought the tie back with a goal in the 27th minute and 37th.
At the end of the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen and give Dundee their first lead in the match, and at the end of the game, they scored the fifth goal and with it, the victory.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller died trying to save hundreds of passengers from a devastating earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller became a hero in ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers took off after being killed.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Several powerful aftershocks have occurred in the area, with many trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post and flee the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
Instead, he stayed there to ensure the proper take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Next, he jumped off the control tower when he saw it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian Air Force spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We took a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear that", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, and the Indonesian Disaster Management Bureau says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The rate is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under the rubble and many others have not been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Bureau.
Palu has been completely destroyed by waves of up to six metres, and a mass burial will take place there on Sunday.
We're getting military and commercial aircraft bringing in support and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance full of corpses arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing all the food from the supermarkets.
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working as quickly as possible to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there".
This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palura on Sunday and explained to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? Just reported by CNN.
This year, Indonesia was also hit by another earthquake, the one in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports a man missing after plane crash in a lake
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now reports a man missing after 47 passengers and crew were properly evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it was only on Saturday afternoon that it was possible to confirm that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to reporters who asked for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Thanks to local boats, the remaining passengers and crew were rescued while on the way to land at Chuuk Island airport after the plane crashed into the water.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The exact cause and sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the US Army say the plane crashed into a lake near the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed too low.
"That's a really good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and several other passengers had easily reached the emergency exits of the sinking plane through the water that reached their waists.
He said the flight attendants were scared and they were fighting, and he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Army said the help of fishermen working on improvements to the nearby pier was also instrumental in the rescue efforts, with an inflatable boat being used to bring passengers ashore before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in PNG over the past two decades, but none have been caused by Air Niugini.
An analyst has compiled a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor postponed the case on Saturday for the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he used cell phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she was killed.
Rowlett claimed that she had received location data from several cell phones showing that the woman died in the evening with Tellis Chambers, thereby refuting Tellis's earlier claim, according to The Clarion Ledger.
The data showed that Tellis's cell phone was with Chambers's at the time Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, at which point the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday, and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis's claim that he was in the truck in Sanford that night was true, Sanford said he was lying, because the truck was in Nashville.
There was another inconsistency, Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before he died.
But according to his cell phone records, he'd only known her a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted all of Chambers' text messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out", Hale said.
The defense will begin final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that the jury trial will take place on the same day.
What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio is challenging people who have a negative view of the genre, and they're trying to fill their music with a positive message.
Bristol band The High Breed say hip-hop music has abandoned its early political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip-hop conscious again popular.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have seen a revival of such hip-hop in recent times in the UK, through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?
A babysitter in New York sues a couple for firing her after a racist message.
A babysitter in New York sued a couple for discriminating against her and expelling her after receiving a text from her mother who said she was "just another Negro".
The couple denied being racist, saying the accusation was "exaggerated".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to learn that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when Maurice came home on her first day of work in 2016.
"Wow, that was a text message from Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and she sent it twice.
According to the New York Post, when he realized the mistake, he reportedly felt "uncomfortable" at Plasco-Flaxman, and fired Miss Maurice, the previous nanny, who was African-American, saying she had not been a good employee and that he expected a Filipino nanny to replace her.
He paid Miss Maurice for the one day's work, and he hired an Uber to take her home.
Now, Maurice has sued the couple, demanding compensation for the damage caused by his dismissal, including $350 a day for six months, because, although he was without a contract, he was originally hired to live in the house for six months and take care of her.
"I want to show them that this kind of thing is not done", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied being racist, and said it was sensible and necessary to fire Maurice because they were afraid that he would not be trusted after he had offended him.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to tell him.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist, explained Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Not a chance.
Explaining that the allegation was "not so bad", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a "difficult situation".
You're gonna go looking for someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude, add your investment bankers.
The legal case is still ongoing, and a public opinion tribunal has quickly indicted the couple on social media, punishing them for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington's publisher was concerned that readers might not like a talking bear, a new letter shows.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said this about the letter: "It's hard to put myself in the shoes of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny that we know all about the Paddington hit.
His father was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book thanks to a small toy bear; his daughter said his father had a positive attitude about people rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had a gazi-sweet flavor, as he died last year.
As for Paddington, he said he was an important member of the family, and that his father was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not arrogant", she said.
But Paddington was so real to him, that he almost made him feel like one of his children who had achieved something, that you were proud of him, even if it wasn't your achievement.
I think that's how he saw success at Paddington.
Although it was a product of his own imagination, Paddington always credited him with the credit.
My daughter was dying, so I had to go to the phone.
Soon after landing, she was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, but doctors could do nothing to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was very serious, that he didn't think he'd come out", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was running out and she was slowly leaving her system.
He died a little earlier than I expected, and that was it.
All I could do was sit back and wait, knowing that it would all start there.
I couldn't stop crying because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I had to hold it back.
Finally, Madame Ednan-Laperouse, who had been grieving ever since for the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, forgetting the grief she felt.
"No one knew", he said.
I was bowing my head and tears were pouring down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved it.
Some angry women have put up signs on a bridge to prevent people from committing suicide.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide want to prevent more people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have just put up signs on a bridge in Wales with messages of hope and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any of my parents to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, now 45, lives in Lydney, and she said her son had a gift for cooking, and he had a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said her smile lit up everything.
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
This is what Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect".
Mrs. Davis made some signs, so people would know that there's someone you can tell what's going on with you and someone who can help you, even if it's a friend.
Don't shut up, you have to talk.
Mrs Humphreys and Mrs Davies have been friends for a long time, and she was her partner for 15 years shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He didn't say he was sad, he didn't say he was depressed", he said.
A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
She was so upset on Christmas Day that when the kids opened their presents, she didn't even look at them.
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they need to move on, because it leaves a hole in the family.
It's killing us all.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the line as the FBI opens an investigation into his death.
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for, like a time-limited or district-limited investigation, maybe we could get some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee might be "divided" in the face of the obstacles posed by the party's enthusiasts.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters refuse to allow the FBI to investigate?
The negative opinion is due to the time.
With only five weeks to go until the midterm elections on November 6, Republicans are expected to score a dismal run, which would leave their favorite man in a very weak position for the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has made numerous phone calls to the senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes their report?
A vote is being held in the Senate, which is currently comprised of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, if he does, Vice President Mike Pence could break the tie and take it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has been declining since Kim came to power.
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Department, said there were 1,127 refugees in the previous year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher fines on human traffickers have had a major impact.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Almost all North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship sooner or later.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and they're often forcibly repatriated.
North Korea and South Korea are still in a war, and relations between the two have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
Earlier in June, a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where they agreed on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the North Koreans of making no progress since the US sanctions.
"If we don't have any confidence in the United States, we won't have any confidence in our own national security, and as things stand, we won't be the first to lay down our weapons", Mr. Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi tells Brett Kavanaugh she's "hysterical" and she's not ready to be on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and said that she's not ready to be on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would have called it "hysteria", Pelosi said -- that was her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh denied sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and sometimes he would almost scream and stutter when he talked about his family and his youth.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats in the House, calling the allegations against him "organized and insulting defamation" by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that she cannot be on the Supreme Court because she has shown an unbiased view of the Democrats.
"With these statements and his attitude against the Clintons and the Democrats, he's out of the league", he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if Kavanaugh would run if elected and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll say this: if she's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then she's not ready to be on the Supreme Court, or the court that we're sitting in right now", Pelosi said.
Right now, Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which applies conservative justice.
In the appeal court, Kavanaugh avoided questions when asked if he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"A hysterical, impartial person can't go to court and expect to be treated well", Pelosi said.
And women should be in charge.
It's a fair speech, months and years of terrible rage, and he can't let go without crying.
"We cry when we smoke", Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's weird, is it?
She went on to say, "A woman who was a senior executive helped me tremendously, and she told me that she cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "Now that I'm crying, you can think of me as sad.
But I'm mad.
And then he would just keep going.
And I thought it was a great idea.
Tears are not a bad way to express anger, because they are somewhat misinterpreted.
I remember clearly what happened in one of my first jobs, in an office that was mostly men, and I was crying out of rage, and an older woman grabbed me by the neck, and from the beginning I was a little afraid of the cold, and she took me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he said.
They don't know you have rabies.
They think you're upset, and they'll feel good that they understood you.
Patricia Schroeder was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, and she worked with Gary Hart during his presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a ship called Monkey Business and it was discovered that his wife was having an affair with another woman who was not his wife and he declined the race, Ms. Schroeder, devastated, decided to run for president herself.
"It was a poorly thought out decision", he laughed 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called them "White Man and the Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign had been going on for years, and he was following the fundraiser, so he decided he wasn't going to run until he had collected two million dollars.
The fight was lost.
He found out that some of his fans who gave the men $1,000 only gave him $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not campaign, she was so moved: her gratitude to the people she supported, her frustration with the system that made it so difficult for her to get money and voters instead of delegates, and her anger at sexist attitudes, and finally, she spoke with a limp.
"You'd think I was nervous", Ms. Schroeder explained about the reaction of the press to her behavior.
You must have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my headstone?
Did she cry?
A US-China trade war could benefit Beijing.
The trade war between the US and China was marked by a series of turbulent trade negotiations. Even if the conflict continues, experts say the rifts between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing a tax on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week, with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion, affecting half of all goods shipped from China to the US.
Beijing has repeatedly taken retaliatory measures, the latest of which has been to raise tariffs by between 5 and 10 percent on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has said it will compensate for any U.S. rise, and the world's second-largest economy won't be able to blink so easily.
Asking Washington to back down would result in a lawsuit, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be even more embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing does well, the U.S. trade war pressure could benefit China in the long run, as it would reduce the dependency between the two economies.
"A hasty decision by politicians in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic stagnation in either country, which is more dangerous than observers previously thought", said researcher Abigail Grace, who works with other experts on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready to allow refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready to allow refugees who wish to return voluntarily, and is asking for help in rebuilding its country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation in the region today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the anti-terrorism process", he said.
The government continues rehabilitation of the areas devastated by terrorism to ensure a return to normalcy as soon as possible.
Now, the situation is that refugees who want to voluntarily return to their countries of origin, who were forced to leave because of terrorism and economic measures that made their daily lives and livelihoods difficult, can return.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for your help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he said he would not accept any conditional aid from countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
After defeating the USA team with a final score of 16.5 points to 10.5 points, the European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup held at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight times on European soil, and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the crown again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the USA.
The American star Phil Mickelson had a rough time for most of the tournament, and threw the starting shot into the water on the 16th hole of the third hole, passing the lead to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Milinari stood out in every round, becoming one of only four players to ever score 5, 0 and 0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth scored 5-4 and was eliminated against the worst player in the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's greatest player, Dustin Johnson, scored 2-1 against Ian Poulter of the United Kingdom, and reached the Ryder Cup final.
The Spanish Sergio García, who had participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the tournament's leading European winner with 25.5 race points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself tonight.
It's been a rough year.
So she's just thanking Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy, to have the cup back.
"This is a team effort, and I'm happy that I was able to contribute", said García, excited after the European victory.
He passes the trophy to Spaniard John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's singles match (2-1).
"I'm so proud to have defeated Tiger Woods because I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now holds the record of 13, 21, and 3 Ryder Cup wins.
Funny statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, outscored only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the entire weekend trying to find a solution to the difficult situation, except for players Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high quality golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Fury of the USA said this about the team's poor play, "I'm proud of my boys, they tried".
This morning, we put a little bit of pressure on Europe.
It didn't work.
Say hello to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players have done great.
We'll meet again, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll get it over with.
I love my 12 boys, and I'm very proud to be their captain.
We have to accept defeat.
We're out of the game.
Red tide reports, concentrations are down in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
According to the latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the concentration of red tide in the Tampa Bay area has dropped significantly.
According to the committee, conditions for flowering are more irregular in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colliere counties, resulting in decreasing concentrations.
In the northwest, the red tide extends about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The irregularities are only 10 miles outside Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
The red tide has also reached Pasco County.
Concentration levels are moderate in or near Pinellas County, low and high near Hillsborough County, none and high in Manatee County, none and high near Sarasota County, none and medium in Charlotte County, none and high near Lee County and low in Collier County.
The number of people experiencing respiratory irritation continues to rise in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
In contrast, no cases of the virus have been reported in northwest Florida in recent weeks.
