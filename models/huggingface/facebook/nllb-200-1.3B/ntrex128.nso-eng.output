Members of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) are worried they will look like a bunch of idiots
Some Members of the Assembly have expressed concern about the proposal to change the way they are called to MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This was due to the prevailing motive to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly on all sides of the political spectrum fear that this is a mockery.
A member of the Labour Party who is a Member of the Assembly says his group is concerned that the issue is in line with Twp and Pwp".
For readers not resident in Wales: In Welsh twp means blunder and pwp means cake.
A member of the Plaid Assembly party said the whole group was happy and made suggestions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative party said his party was open to a name change, saying only that it was an abbreviation of the dolls appearing on the MWP Doll List.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same way as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting a bill to change the name, said: "It is clear that the final decision in the matter of any terms by which Members shall be called is upon the members themselves".
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gives members of the Welsh assembly the power to change their name.
In June, the Commission published its decision after consulting the public on the proposal and found that a majority of people supported the idea of the meeting being called by the Welsh Parliament.
As to how the Assembly Members were named, the commission prefers to call them Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but the choice to call them MWPs has received widespread public support.
It seems that Assembly Members are proposing to choose another name, but reaching agreement may be left to the Director of Negotiations, Elin Jones, who is expected to take the official picture of the name change in a few weeks.
The amended bill will include other changes to the way the meeting is run, including removing Assembly Members and the structure of the executive committee.
Members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to choose what they want to be called when the time comes to debate the bill.
Macedonians go to the polls on changing the country's name
On Sunday voters will vote on whether they want their country's name changed to the Republic of North Macedonia".
This general election was held to settle a decades-long dispute over neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighboring country appear as their own and has repeatedly been against it joining the EU and NATO membership polls.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change, said he would throw the vote into the fray.
But voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say they should buy membership in the EU and NATO by changing the name.
The roof of St. Martin's Church falls silent as churches rage in Harlem
"Historically, the adults I spoke to on every corner were church and boys", Mr. Adams said.
"There is none today".
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
These days "people have different ways of enjoying themselves", he says.
"The slums are no longer the usual vacation spots for the city".
As for the churches, he said he was concerned that the money from the sale of property would not last as long as the leaders thought, "and soon they would be back in the bargain.
He also said that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings that are overcrowded to replace empty worship facilities.
He said: "Most of these flats will be bought by whites and they will hasten the closing of these churches completely because it is unlikely that many of the people who will live in those flats will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black city - in 1870 it was called the Metropolitan Community, and ten years later it was renamed St. Martin's.
The original Methodist congregation, which was all-white, left in the 1930's.
Then the black congregation that had been a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was founded under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who had led a crackdown on 125th Street, Harlem's main commercial street, since the stores there refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 destroyed the building but Father Johnson's churchmen developed plans to rebuild it, restoring the church's steelwork.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called it "the poor man's shell".
The expert who played the flute in July also called it "a cultural treasure" and "a historically irreplaceable instrument".
The scholar, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, said that it was the first flute in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago went to play a larger flute at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's had not found someone else for him.
What happened at St. Martin's in the past few months has been a showdown between architects and contractors, some brought in by lower-ranking church leaders, while others were brought in by the Episcopal diocese.
The council - the church's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July complaining that the diocese would demand that the costs be passed on to the council, but the council was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers have complained that there is no transparency in the dais section.
A 13-year-old boy is injured by a shark when he escapes to hunt for lobsters in California
Officials say a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark on Saturday in California when he was going to hunt for lobsters on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was on the phone with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's cry for help, and the group rushed to the boy to get him out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was the sound of the joy of catching a lobster, but then he realized that it was a worm saying It's one!
I am the only one!'
As soon as he reached the boy, Hammel said, he noticed that his chest was broken.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a sword in the water!'" said Hammel.
The boy was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by plane and is said to be in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked him is unknown.
Marine Captain Larry Giles told the media that the shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, and it was thought to be a non-threatening species.
Giles added that the victim had severe chest injuries
Officials have sealed the beach to no-go from Ponto Beach, Casablad to Swami's, Ecinitas for 48 hours for security and surveillance.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's projects enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by creating beauty-store shelves with experts to serve customers.
As part of a major push to enter the UK's two billion pound (£2.8bn) beauty market, a growing market in the fall of fashion and home appliances, large beauty shelves have been installed in 11 stores nationwide and, if successful, will be added to other stores next summer.
This investment in beauty is so great that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the large shelves that formerly housed TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double its beauty products to 3,000 brands including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in the labels of brands like those found in Boots stores.
The supermarket also opened its own boutique of cosmetics so that most products are free of animal-derived ingredients - something that many new customers want.
In addition, the fragrance retailer, Fragrance Shop, will use additional shelves for its products at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this summer.
Online shopping and the new trend of buying small daily items from local stores have led supermarkets to experiment with how to encourage people to shop.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that small shops will eventually become supermarkets as supermarkets try to compete with Aldi and Lidl's discount stores by offering more services and eliminating food sales.
Sainsbury's has added Argos stores to hundreds of supermarkets and has also added several Habitats stores after buying those stores two years ago, which it says has raised grocery prices and increased revenue.
Previous efforts by supermarkets to revive the beauty and pharmaceutical sectors have been in vain.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boots in the early 2000's, but the partnership was broken up when a dispute arose over how to divide the money from the store's pharmacy.
The new strategy came about after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for about 125 million pounds (£125m), three years ago.
It says that Lloyds will contribute to the project by adding luxury leather cosmetics, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's marketing manager said: "We have changed the look of our beauty products shelves to improve the experience of our customers.
We also use specially trained individuals who will be ready and able to give counsel.
The variety of our products is designed to meet all the needs of the people and the attractive appearance together with the fact that our shops are located close to the people means that we are now a popular beauty store that challenges the old shopping habits".
Peter Jones 's been criticised after Holly Willoughby pulled out of £11million deal
Peter Jones, a Dragons Den favourite, has left the show after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of her £11million lifestyle lease deal to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their household appliances and other Truly rental appliances.
That joint venture was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop lease.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning posted on Instagram that he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den favourite, Peter Jones, furious when he pulled out of their lucrative last-minute deal - to focus solely on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones "screamed" when the TV personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business deal - for £1.5 million - accuses him of not having enough time to promote Truly's household goods and other dollar items.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop pound and was expected to be twice as much as Willoughby's estimate of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was quitting Truly, Jones took a jet from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
"Truly was the main thing about Holly", said the source.
It would be a long-term future job that would sustain him for decades.
His decision to withdraw left all involved in the process stunned.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday, the business was about to be broken up.
The merchandise for sale is packed in the Marlow HQ warehouse".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most popular investors, could cost the firm millions of dollars in heavy investment in various items such as handbags, candles, clothes and furniture, and could delay the launch of the firm.
It can mean the end of long-standing friendships.
Willoughby, a mother of three and her husband Dan Baldwin, were close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby organized Truly and Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The families went on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will no longer be the M&S news anchor and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night a source close to Jones said "We will not discuss his business affairs".
Communicate intensely 'first with one another'
He also blamed the criticism he would receive in the press for saying things that were inappropriate for the president and for his confidence in the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so generous?
Trump spoke in a sarcastic manner as if he were reading the news.
"I have not given up anything".
He said Kim was keen to meet him again after they met in Singapore in June where Trump hailed it as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament talks have been postponed.
More than three months after the June Singapore meeting, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the same "position" on the U.S. side regarding the measures already taken by North Korea to disarm.
Rather, he said the U.S. is continuing sanctions designed to keep the tension alive.
In his inauguration speech Trump expressed a positive outlook.
He said: We have good relations with North Korea.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Many would have been killed.
Now we work together better.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced good results - no more rocket tests, the release of prisoners of war, and the repatriation of remaining American soldiers.
He recommended an unusual method of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people crowding out of the stadium where they want to squeeze into the crowded interior! we only have about 200 people standing here", said Trump, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Island in Indonesia, Hundreds Killed
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had disappeared, it was not declared a national disaster, which is what international aid is calling for.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been made clear that there is no need for international assistance, so the situation is somewhat difficult to deal with", Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work in the disaster area.
Mr. Sutopo, who is the spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities are reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations can be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given how often Indonesia is hit by earthquakes, the country remains unprepared to deal with this natural disaster in a dismal way.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, such shelters do not exist in other coastal areas.
The obvious fact that no tsunami warning system is in place in Palu, despite other warnings, may have contributed to the death toll.
During that time, it has not been easy to travel from one of Indonesia's many islands to another.
Now natural disasters make the habit of traveling even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo said his main concern was improving Indonesia's infrastructure and congested roads during his election campaign, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But funds are lacking in Mr. Joko's administration for the next election next summer.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of possible divisions due to the tensions in Indonesia, where many Muslims are clinging to their old belief system.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using lethal knives, bows, arrows, and other deadly weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool balancing the points against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League when he scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was hit by Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of just under 30 metres and Chelsea's numbers, at a time when his team would have been 1-0 down.
He stepped on the ball with his left foot before throwing it into the pocket.
The ball went up the box and toward the right corner of the scroll.
From there the ball came down and passed over the leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and entered the tent.
"I was trying to be there, to get the ball and often players like Shaq are jumping as far forward as they can, so I tried to take as much time as I could", said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and walk away, and I stepped on it once, rather than think I shot it".
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored 25 minutes into the game.
The goalkeeper in the Blues passed the ball on the heel to return it to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before turning in the middle of the field and running into the centre to score for Liverpool.
Kovacic caught the ball and passed it to the center fielder once.
He then kicked a good ball that pierced the rim and led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran from the defenders and with his left foot he threw it into the scraps where it passed the Liverpool midfielder, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday, London.
The death toll from the tsunami rose to 832 in Indonesia
On Sunday morning the national disaster agency announced that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
The spokesman of the Association, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a press conference that many people were still trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings when the earthquake hit with a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday and caused waves of about 7 meters in height.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was surrounded by the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man, suspected of murder of woman stabbed
Investigations are ongoing after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police appealed to the local people to have any eyewitnesses report the incident.
"Investigations are still in progress but I appeal to anyone near John Street, Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us", said Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have front-facing cameras in their cars to contact us as they may have information that could be useful to our investigation.
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found in the yard.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The police said that the investigation is ongoing, and they are about to inform the relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver from Gryson Mews arrives and tries to get into his apartment but is told by the police that no one is allowed to leave or enter the building.
She was shocked to learn what had happened.
Residents were told that it would be hours before they were allowed to return to the building.
One policeman was heard telling another man that the whole place seemed to be the scene of a crime.
A woman with a scar on her face appeared at the scene.
He keeps repeating the words this is the title.
By 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the restricted area and one was outside.
Several police were stationed inside the restricted area, guarding the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Prevention anonymously on 0800 555 111, and then call 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue becomes the last monument to be attacked in the debate over rewriting history
Removing it would be a fitting punishment for the Taliban-like destruction he caused to many cultural and religious artifacts in England, destroyed by his zealous Puritan followers.
But the Cromwellian party described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "There was no way in the current dispute to remove the statues, and then Oliver Cromwell's outside the Palace of Westminster is not attacked.
The destruction of cultural and religious heritage during the English civil war was not Cromwell's doing.
Perhaps the wrongful Cromwell is being punished for the actions of his great-grandfather Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's eloquent description of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century sentiment and to the documented history of a man whom many believe is still worthy of being remembered.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Many, especially in the 19th century than now, regarded Cromwell as a parliamentary champion against outside pressure during his reign.
Whether that is the absolute truth or not is a matter of debate.
The clear thing is that the conflict in the mid-17th century changed the course of our nation, and Cromwell is considered one of the men on the other side of that divide.
What he accomplished as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and remembered.
A fierce pig attacks a Chinese farmer to death
According to news reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified as Yuan, was found dead with his heart artery ruptured, in a blood-stained valley near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market, Guihou province, in Southern China.
A pig farmer prepares to inoculate pigs in their pen, May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly went with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He says that inside the hook was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, forensic tests confirmed that the pig, weighing about 249 pounds [249 kg] and a half, was the killer.
His cousin, nicknamed Wu, was quoted in the Guiyang Evening New as saying: The cousin's feet were covered with blood and wrinkled.
A security camera caught Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed a man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was put in a secluded spot so that it would not attack again, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the market officials reportedly have been discussing condolences for his death.
Although not common, there have been reported instances of pig attacks on humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband with severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing some 295 kilograms lurked on a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs rarely go wild but if they taste blood it can make them predators.
He said: They like to play.
They are like children, curious ... their purpose is not to harm you.
Your job is simply to respect them.
The remnants of the Rosa River bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern US
Forecasters say that the Rosa Gorge is losing its strength as it heads for the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had wind gusts of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was detected over 200 miles (619 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, thick winds begin to blow in the Pacific Ocean and head east toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches Baja on the California peninsula on Monday, as a tropical storm it will begin to push in tropical moisture to flow northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring 25.4 centimeters (25.4 inches) of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Now tropical moisture combined with dense winds will prepare for heavy rains in the southwest in the coming days.
In this area, rainfall of between two and a half and a half to three and a half inches [2.54 to 10.16 cm] can cause destructive flooding, followed by tidal waves and mudslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture causes rainfall of about 5.08 to 7.62 centimeters per hour, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
About 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters [5.0 to 10.16 inches] of rain is expected in these Southwestern regions, especially Arizona.
Floods can occur as conditions worsen due to the onset of rainfall in the tropics.
It would not be wise to go into the desert on foot, since tropical rains may not fall.
Heavy rains can cause mud flats to become rivers, and thunderstorms bring wind and dust.
The approaching thick winds will bring heavy rains to parts of the Southern California coast.
A single inch of rain may cause a few mudslides and cause the roads to slip.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during this rainy season.
The tropical monsoon will be in Arizona Sunday evening through Monday morning, before it ends up raining everywhere Monday evening through Tuesday.
Heavy rain will cover Four Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
The Arctic will be extremely cold in October, but the tropics will remain warm.
This sometimes results in large temperature changes after short intervals.
There is a fine example of a dramatic difference in the central U.S. on Sunday.
A difference of about 20 degrees in temperature exists between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the warm summer air will begin to reappear.
Most of the central and eastern regions are expected to warm in October and to extend into the 80s from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
On Tuesday New York City may warm to 80 degrees, about 10 degrees above normal.
Forecasts indicate that there is a high probability that temperatures will be above normal in eastern parts of the U.S. until mid-October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations the testimony given Thursday in the heated trial of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of molesting her in the 1980's, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, while the political side was still being debated, the regular Friday program was interrupted at the last minute to make this announcement: an agreement was made by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he knew perfectly well without question that Kavanaugh had cheered him on and tried to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, with all his senses, gives evidence that he knows perfectly well beyond doubt that that did not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people may have watched the trial.
The company counted the viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The full figures were not available for other stations that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also often has trouble counting the viewers in the offices.
To see how many people it could be, it is the size of people watching a football game like the final or the Academy Awards.
Nielsen said that Fox News Channel, whose program directors strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewing rating of any channel, with 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's trial.
ABC was next with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
After the trial, people are already very interested.
Flake was the star of that Friday's event.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would support Kavanaugh's nomination, he appeared on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, joined by a roar from protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the trial before the Judiciary Committee.
He stood staring down for a few minutes as he was flashed in front of the CNN camera.
"I am the one standing before you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the world the truth?
"You were strong at a time when most women were weak", she was told.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the elevator rang he would give further statements at the hearing before the committee.
The media covered the case for hours, until later the Senate Judiciary Committee was to decide whether to support Kavanaugh's canonization.
But Flake said he would do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the saint next week, something several Democrats have been pushing for.
Flake was somewhat convinced when speaking to his Democratic colleague, Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's nomination was strong because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh before the polls.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May says critics are 'politically biased' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May said that critics of her decision to leave the European Union are "politically optimistic" about Britain's future and underestimate the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018, for the Conservative Party Summit.
In a near-instant interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched an attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tax payments "is really a scam".
Wayde Sims dies of gunshot wounds: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in solitary confinement on a charge of manslaughter, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released the video of Sims and Simpson's altercation, and the police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, a CBS report says working with WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde and killing him.
His bond is set at $350,000, according to the Attorney's report.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the bullet went into the neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police Special Fugitive Search Force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for assisting in the full investigation by arresting the suspect.
LSU team captain Joe Alleva thanked the local police "for doing the job thoroughly and ensuring that justice is served".
Sims was 20 years old.
This 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a LSU basketball player.
Last summer he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked and "appalled" by Wayde's death.
"This is something you worry about all the time", says Wade.
A volcano erupting in Mexico City
As the Popocatepetl volcano erupts, its coal reaches the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican residents to stay away from the volcanic eruption after the mudflats and reported 183 gas and ash leaks in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring the roaring and shaking in other areas.
Pictures in social media show a thin layer of charcoal being smeared on car windows in suburban Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Since the September 2017 earthquake that struck central Mexico at a magnitude of 7.1, geologists have detected an increase in the likelihood of a volcanic eruption that sits 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
Since 1994, the volcanic eruption "Don Goyo" has been a constant threat.
Police clash with Catalan independence activists before the anniversary of the independence elections
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands joined protests marking the first anniversary of the referendum on Catalonia's full independence from Spain on the basis of their ethnicity.
A group of masked independence activists were stopped by a riot police officer who threw eggs at the police and sprayed them with a pale paint, filling the streets that are often crowded with tourists with a black cloud of dust.
Later that day another riot broke out when police used police batons to stop the fighting.
For hours the independence activists shouted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" and the trade union activists could hear them shouting, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries to the chest, according to a local newspaper report.
In a region where people are demanding independence from us, there is a summer of tension following the October 1st elections that the Spanish government has declared illegal but which are favored by Catalan independence supporters.
Voters cast a staggering majority for independence, although the turnout was small compared with those opposed to the Catalan secession, who largely opposed the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last summer after police tried to block elections at polling stations in the region where violent riots broke out.
Pro-independence groups had sat outside on Friday night to prevent the purity of supporting the national police.
The protest continued but they were forced to change their ways.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the independence protests with his wife, said that he had no doubt that Catalonia would ever gain independence.
"Last summer was the most wonderful time of our lives.
I watched my parents shed tears of joy when they were able to vote but now we are standing with the man in the chair", she says.
Although Catalan pro-independence parties managed to win a decisive margin in the regional elections in December last year, they have struggled to keep the same momentum this year, with most of their leaders either running or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the elections and having declared independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the pro-police protest on her phone, said that the confusion was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next summer.
"To vote for me in the European elections is the best way to show that I do not approve of the opposition to democratic principles and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government", he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly ran over a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 BST.
The fire damaged the piers and the building itself, said National Security Inspector Bob Blemmings.
It may also be that the car was shot at some point.
Livingston defeats Rangers 1-0 on a scoreline of Menga
Dolly Menga scored her first point to help Livingston win the game
Livingston's recent promotion to the Rangers stunned when Steven Gerrard was sacked for the second time in 18 games as the Ibrox coach.
Dolly Menga's run separated the two teams while Gary Holt's team tied for the points with Hibernian in second place.
This season Gerrard's side have yet to win a Premiership game away from home and next Sunday face the leaders at Hearts, eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, who has been undefeated in six games in the league, and coach Holt, who has not been defeated since taking over from Kenny Miler last month, have been on the road.
Livingston left opportunities to its flying tourists
The Holt team had to prepare long before they could hit the target, with their shots causing the Rangers endless trouble.
Scott Robinson got the opportunity but played the opportunity as his ball passed the goal line, and Alan Lithgow's ball went backwards after finishing trying to catch a headshot by Craig Halkett which passed the goal line.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play first knowing they could cause problems for the visitors if the ball was put on the ground.
And that was how an important point came to light.
The Rangers kicked a free kick and Livingston found the hole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to put Menga in a good position to pick up the ball, and connect it to the net from the circle of the field.
At the time, the Rangers had held the ball for a long time but found the back wall of the home team stiff and at all the midfielder Liam Kelly was not concerned,
This practice continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to block the ball.
Scott Pittman was knocked out by Rangers defender Allan McGregor's leg and Lithgow scored the majority of the distance on one occasion when Livingston had got a set kick.
The Rangers kept throwing the balls into Livingston's box and kept holding them, but the crowd refused two requests for a penalty - one after Halkett dropped Glenn Middleton off the bench, and one for holding the ball in his hand.
Livingston made a thing to be taken - when we were shooting distances
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston has done a fine job with good decisions.
They scored on a clean sheet, continuing to outperform the odds despite the upturn.
There has been little change in their lineup and personnel since their return to the big leagues, but we give Holt a glimpse of how he has made the team thriving since his arrival.
He has a lot of blankets.
Captain Halkett is good, cleverly arranging the back wall, while Menga was giving Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall no offense throughout the game.
The Rangers were not at all in a hurry.
Although they sometimes even had to be under Gerrard's authority, they lacked those qualities.
Their ball to the mark was weak - they only once hit the back wall - and that is what the Rangers must stand for with their feet, as it is in the middle.
Different receptions for Erdogan in Cologne
The lights were chasing the ear and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - intended to restore ties between NATO nations.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that because of security they prevented the powerful crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but crowds of supporters lined up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan activists - mostly Kurds - also expressed their views, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to recognize him.
The two-sided protest shows the courage of a tourist hailed as a hero by the German Turks and a tyrant by others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist has died in a car crash involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford road, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and emergency medical services arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes months after a cyclist died after being hit by a runaway on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were trying to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roads have been blocked and buses are being diverted to other routes in the area and motorists are being encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six consuls wounded in the ambush
Six constables are chained to the pillow of a heavily guarded men's prison, says the Prison Office.
A riot broke out at HMP's Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
"Tornados", special Castaboles, were called in to control the riot, which involved eight prisoners and was blocked on one side.
The consuls were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for Prison Services said: "Specially trained prison officers have been dispatched to deal with the ongoing situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six ministers were treated for seizures.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are not fooled when we say that those responsible will be sent to the police and will be held for a long time".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that a prison warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot police were called in to control a riot in which workers were attacked with sniper bullets.
Typhoon Rosa Strikes Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a Swell of Flooding (Seasons of Drought May Be Happy)
A mild storm rarely strikes Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa will release its remaining energy into the Desert Southwest, and it could result in the dangers of tidal flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning of desertification on Tuesday for Arizona west into Nevada southeast, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to leave directly for Phoenix on Tuesday, to be delayed Monday night by rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only ten tropical cyclones or no cyclones have moved about 200 miles [200 km] through Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that moved at a speed of 64 miles [40 km] in the AZ basin".
Recent forecasts by the National Weather Service predict rainfall of 5 to 10 centimeters, and around 15 centimeters on Arizona's Great Rim.
In some areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin they are likely to gain 2 to 5 centimeters, and here there is a possibility of up to 10 centimeters.
Rosa will be a blessing in areas affected by drought, not in danger of flooding that causes mudslides.
While floods do not destroy the raw materials, additional rains can be of great help as the Southwest is now plagued by drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a devastating drought, second only to the high", according to a weather.com report.
First, the Rosa Cyclone will bring rains throughout the Baja California desert of Mexico.
Rosa, still with moderate storm strength on Sunday morning, will be a storm with wind speeds of 137 kilometers per hour, 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm will join the cool waters of the Pacific and then weaken.
So it is expected to reach Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm and humidity on Monday afternoon or at dusk.
Rainfall throughout the Mexican plains can be torrential, causing the risk of severe flooding.
"Rainfall of 7 to 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with a possible rainfall of up to 25 centimeters", reports weather.com.
Rosa will now cross north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a mild storm, then rising over Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat to Rosa or its remnants is the monsoon rains in Baja California, northern Sonora, and the U.S.A. Desert Southwest", according to the National Institute of Tropical Depression.
These rains are expected to produce deadly floods that can cause mudslides and landslides in the deserts, and rockfalls in the mountains.
Man stranded in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he is said to be in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, said the police.
The police are appealing to anyone who may have taken a video of the incident on a cell phone to identify themselves.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has been taunted by the malice, the rage' of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the democratic Party's mainstream and conservative values", Trump said at a party rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that since Kavanaugh's nomination he has been "damaged by the malice, the rage" of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying and vehemently denying the accusation that he sexually abused Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified in the case.
On Saturday the President said that on that day "the American people saw the wisdom and character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to honor one of the most brilliant jurists of our time, a jurist with a distinguished record of public service", he said before a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president spoke indirectly about Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican majority voting in the midterm elections.
"We are just five weeks away from some of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not just a candidate, but a real candidate", Trump said.
"That is why I am running for the Republican nomination".
Trump claims that the Democrats' intent is "to oppose and obstruct".
A primary vote for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate on Friday, the GOP's senior vice president told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number still rising
At least 384 people died, many washed up as huge waves slammed into the coast, as a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to a report by authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate on the coast of Palu city on Friday when a six-meter-high wave hit the clay as the sun turned to the horizon, killing dozens and destroying everything it encountered.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were doing their own thing on the beach and didn't immediately flee and become victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster prevention agency, told Jakarta briefly.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it tore cars, shovels, nets, hit everything on dry land", says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was crossing the ocean at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
He says that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and save themselves.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu villages.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster relief department show that many buildings and shops have been damaged, bridges have been twisted and collapsed, and a mosque has been surrounded by water.
By Saturday, the coastal city was in turmoil.
Several earthquakes were felt in areas with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Bureau of Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city, at the tip of a long, narrow tunnel, he said, would have exacerbated the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" as he said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that there could be more casualties and damage along the coastline 300 kilometers north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, near the earthquake's epicenter.
The negotiations leading to Donggala "were completely interrupted and we know no details about it", says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living here", said the Red Cross, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the disaster-affected areas.
"This is a disaster in itself", he says, "but it can get worse".
The organization was widely criticized on Saturday for not alerting the public to the tsunami that hit Palu, although government officials said the waves had not reached the time of the warning.
A video taken by a civilian and uploaded to the media shows a man on the top floor of a building screaming in the street below about a coming tsunami.
Minutes later, a wave of water swept ashore, destroying buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that interrupted talks in Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to organize rescue operations.
The military has begun sending relief planes from Jakarta and other cities, many say, but those rescued are in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for relief campaigns only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the Palu fire centers on Saturday.
The Indonesian tsunami kills more than 800 people.
Truly Sad News.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the workers had taken refuge in tents set up in the yard by their office, they had overcome a disaster along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", she says.
Truly sad news.
Even as the relief teams began preparing to deliver relief, they complained that skilled outside relief workers were being denied entry into Palu.
According to Indonesian law, relief, relief, and other necessary supplies from other countries may begin to enter the disaster zone if the area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a provincial disaster", says Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'This is indeed a national disaster,' we can open up international aid but the situation is not there yet".
As the second tsunami hits Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the missing are hopeful that miraculously their loved ones will emerge from the natural disasters alive.
On Saturday, a little boy is found in a shed.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had spent two days under the rubble with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian national paragliding coach, had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others detained at the Roa Roa Hotel, among them Mr. Mandagi, and his students.
"Like the head of a paragliding team", he said, "I am very stressed".
Mr. Gendon said that hours after the news broke that the Roa Roa Hotel had fallen on paragliding players and enthusiasts, he sent WhatsApp messages in shock to Palu players, who were celebrating on the beach.
But his messages showed that he had gone with a little one, not two grey horns.
"I don't think the messages went away", he says.
Thieves take $26,750 from an ATM in Newport-le-Vie
On Friday morning robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was contributing to an ATM in Newport in Levee, according to a news report from the Newport Police Department.
A driver pulled money from the ATM at the amusement center and arranged to cross another amount, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
While busy, a man "came running after Brink's work and stole the bag of money brought in.
Eyewitnesses saw a group of suspects flee the scene, according to the report, but the police did not say how many were involved in the attack.
Anyone who may have information on how to identify suspects should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
Making the name change announcement on Twitter on Saturday, it wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for some time and has used the moniker as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
The creator of the program says he is replacing singer Ariana Grande on the program, which was cancelled "due to emotional instability".
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current name, West once said that this word is important to his faith.
"I believe 'ye' is the most frequently occurring word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,' or wena", West said earlier this year in an interview about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, we are us.
I went from Kanye, meaning alone, to Ye - just showing our good, our bad, our frustrations, everything.
This album is a mirror of who we are".
He is one of the famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs is variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this summer he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West band member JAY-Z also says that it doesn't matter whether or not a spine or capital letters are added.
AMLO Mexico vows never again to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly sworn-in president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that the military will never again be used against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student uprising.
On Saturday Lopez Obrador promised from Tlatelolco Plaza that "never will the military be used to silence the Mexican people".
Soldiers blew up a peaceful march on the plaza on October 2, 1968, and 300 people died as student movements for social equality proliferated in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly financial support to students and opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have resulted in gangs.
U.S. should double A.I. funding
With China digging deeper into technology, or artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on its research, says AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These statements come after various parts of the U.S.A. government have made announcements about AI, since even the U.S.A. has no firm AI policy.
On the other hand, China announced its strategy last year: it aims to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start", Lee says, "since the U.S.A. has left all other countries behind, and we are almost there, and we expect to discover the next things in AI".
Lee told CNBC this week that double-paying costs would increase the likelihood of Al achieving major success in the U.S.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published last month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has investments in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked on the Al system at Carnegie Mellon University that led to the American Othello, and later became the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee praised the successes achieved by the U.S. government in competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, so that he could offer suggestions.
Lee said U.S. researchers should work hard to get government funding.
China is not hiring experts; it is firms, Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university students to work for Al in recent years.
Lee said immigration policies could also help bolster Al's U.S. efforts.
He said that he thought people with Al's PhD should be given green cards.
The Chinese National Council issued the next draft of the Artificial Intelligence Development Program in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to academia in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies support U.S. researchers, but the quality of education in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this summer the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence center, designed to bring together workers and students, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that it has made an investment of $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing $100 million a year in summer AI research.
Meanwhile, for months, there has been no action by the U.S. legislature seeking to establish a National Security Council on the subject of Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country's name
Macedonians go to the polls on Sunday to decide whether or not to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve the long-standing conflict between it and Greece, which has refused to swear to membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says that the name of its northern neighbor indicates its rejection of its position and rejects membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June to propose a new name, but opponents argue that the change would affect the culture of many Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the election and refused to support the campaign, raising doubts about whether people would come in large numbers, to make up at least the 50 percent required for a decision.
The question on the ballot paper is: Do you agree to NATO and EU membership under the terms set by Greece.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is in Macedonia's best interest to change it so that it can become a member of organizations such as the EU and NATO, since the country is one of the products of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje, says: "I am here today to vote for the future of this country, to vote for the young Macedonians so that they can live free under the protection of the European Union because that means that we will all live in security".
Although not legally obliged, several members of parliament have expressed support for a resolution to the issue.
To change the name would require a two-thirds vote in parliament.
The national election committee said that there had been no reports of any mishaps at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of voters cast ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, from the city of Skopje, says: "I will choose for the sake of my children, since we live in Europe".
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of Macedonia, which would allow it to attend the NATO-European Union summit in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a few seats in front of the parliament in Skopje, near the tents of protesters.
"We agree with the NATO and EU issue", says Kavadarkov, "but we don't want to get into what we know, not just get into the blackheads.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they want to accept us in Macedonia, we can still move on to other countries such as China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian alliance.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment.
After casting his vote, Zaev said: I believe that many people will agree with this because more than 80 percent of the population supports the EU and NATO.
He said that if the answer is yes, that would prepare us for the future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Research Strategy Institute says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote, which is less than the required number.
A poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would support the proposal.
For the resolution to stand, more than 50 percent of the vote is required.
The failure of this decision will hamper the policy of the Western-oriented government, which has been in office since May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City sneaks through the streets of Brighton to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke into Brighton's ranks as Manchester City beat them 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem as if the scores were going in the opposite direction when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper was handed the ball in the middle of the field and took it from there.
He jumped between the three Brighton players, running across the field.
Aguero then finds himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He penetrated into one of the most impregnable of Brighton's precincts.
He turned left and attacked Sterling.
The English forward also returned the ball to Aguero, who kicked it with his right foot into the goal for Mathew Ryan of Brighton.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero still has a leg problem.
We had expected him to play for 55 or 60 minutes.
But consider what happened.
We are happy that he got the ball.
But it was Sterling who first gave the Blues a chance in this Premier League competition.
The point came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball surrounded by many Brighton players.
He threw a good ball to Leroy Sane from the left side.
Sane grabbed hold of it before aiming at Sterling on the other side of the numbers.
The Blue Angels struck the tip just before the stream began to flow.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to rob the Rockies of a chance
With the Nationals out of the competition, there is no longer much reason to force injuries.
But since Scherzer doesn't like to lose he wants to get into the game on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but he will only play if the Rockies can still advance in the championship, having defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game, NL West.
The Rockies managed to win the Nationals 5-2 on Friday, but they are still working to win the first-team title.
Although we won't get anything after the game, at least we will be able to entertain the crowd here in Denver and the other team we will be playing against will be playing at a very high level this summer.
Why would I not want to participate in the contest?
The Nationals will then announce the players who will start the game on Sunday, and it is reported that it may include Scherzer in the game.
Scherzer, who will be in the starting lineup for the 34th time, played brilliantly on Thursday and will be back on the field on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has a 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding his own Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters having a majority in the midterm elections.
All that we have accomplished will be put to the test in November.
Only five weeks remain before the most important election.
This is not just a joke, I'm not just pretending, but I'm really pretending, I'm going everywhere and I'm running for the best candidate", Trump said.
Trump went on to say, "You're going to see these Democratic candidates, you're already seeing them.
They are determined to seize power in any way they can, proving themselves to be cruel and cruel.
He doesn't care who he tries to get into power, all he wants is power and government, and we're not going to give it to him.
He said the Democrats are in the Anti-Defamation campaign.
He said, "You've seen that over the last four days" and said the Democrats are angry and mean, cruel and untrue.
He addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee and named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which did not sit well with the audience.
Do you remember his response?
Did you provide the documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, slow down. That was the worst sign I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a universal church.
He is patient when people express their opinions.
It was no surprise when the Momentums activists of my party elected me.
I was the last of a long line of Labour candidates who were told they were no longer welcome  just because they expressed our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was similarly treated because of her firm stand against prejudice against Jews.
In my case, I was severely criticised for opposing Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and Europe, but surprisingly Jeremy also contradicted previous leaders on those points.
The announcement that Nottingham East Labour would hold a meeting on Friday said, "We want the meeting to be open and inclusive".
In the eight years I have been a Labour MP, the GC meetings held on Friday evenings have always been like this.
Unfortunately now the attitude in politics is not to promise people to treat them with kindness and gentleness if such a thing ever happened.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour party no longer tolerates dissent, and people's opinions are judged by what the party leadership says.
This started shortly after Jeremy became president, as my political consultant he began to demand that I change my view on issues I would never agree with on the national security of the EU market.
Every time I speak in public  no matter what I say  there will be a wave of gossip on social media demanding that I be removed, criticizing political issues, telling me that I should not be in the Labour party.
And I am not alone in that experience.
In fact, I know that I am even luckier than some of my peers, for I am only politically motivated.
I admire the motivation and determination of my peers who are constantly being abused by sex or racial prejudice but who do not confess.
Another disillusionment with modern politics is that ridicule is not taken seriously.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour party should show patience.
The truth is that we are no longer the one church that everyone can join, we no longer have a spirit of mistrust and the criteria for ordination are becoming more and more strict.
I have been advised several times over the past two years to bow my head, keep quiet and everything will be fine.
But that is not why I am in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, angered that the Thatcher government had neglected my school so much that the buildings fell, I vowed to fight to improve public services to help those in need  whether as a councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can say that he does not know my political position and the matters in which I agree with the leadership.
All I can say to those who support this issue on Friday is that as the country works towards Brexit it will make things harder for families, businesses and prevent the public from accessing services, I do not understand that and I do not want to waste my time and energy supporting the Labour leader.
But in reality my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the people of my constituency, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that nothing will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you, whether it is threats of removal or political repression.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is not yet established
The final two tries changed the outcome in an instant, but Ayr were to win the exciting game to Tennent's Premiership that day.
This unconquered class of ten groups is leading the way.
Finally, thanks to a strong back wall, as well as their good use of opportunities, which lifted the home team and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to rejoice.
"So far our games have not been easy, and we have not won yet, so my heart is clear", says the coach.
"I'll give Ayr a break", said Robyn Christie of Melrose, "they've used their opportunities better than we have".
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, Scottish player Rory Hughes was given a yellow card, was sent off for the Warriors game, made Melrose take advantage of the majority and Jason Baggot scored an unscored try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead on the penalty, before going into the end zone, and then made a solo try to get Ary to the end zone 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, scored by Baggot, narrowed the gap by five points.
The game was long halted because Ruaridh Knott was badly injured, with the hammer removed, and from the restart, Ayr opened a large gap with a try by Stafford McDowall, which was taken by Climo.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card again, and Melrose again took advantage of the majority with a try by Bruce Colvine, under heavy pressure.
But the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for throwing Climo off the penalty line-out, MacPherson scored a point behind Ayr's scores.
Climo scored, as he did in the restart, after Kyle Rowe caught a ball thrown up by David Armstrong and Gregor Henry on the sideline scored for the home team in the fifth try.
Still Game star looking for new green pastures in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is looking to break into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he was appointed as the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, for which he writes and stars alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have said that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning how he will live after playing Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The photographer refused to comment on that point, although the Scottish Sun newspaper informed us that Kiernan wanted to join the successful Glasgow restaurant business.
'This is our sea': landlocked Bolivia hopes that the consortium will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors forgot the headquarters of the naval wall in La Paz.
Government buildings fly blue flags.
The arches of the waterfront from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are littered with the chant: "This sea is rightfully ours.
It is our responsibility to bring you back".
Across landlocked Bolivia, people still remember the bloodshed that occurred when the coast was seized by Chile in the 19th century - and they long to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
They have had that hope for decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia is a strong nation, which says that strength is unity and peace, and we certainly expect to win this case", says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's ambassador.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on big screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague will represent Bolivia when - after decades of irregular negotiations - Chile should approve negotiations to give Bolivia a sea-trade route.
Evo Morales, the beloved and indigenous president, who is fighting dubious elections again next summer - also has a delegation traveling to hear the congressional decision on Monday.
"We are very close to having the Pacific Ocean back", he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court may not rule in favor of Bolivia - and it will remain the same if it does.
The UN team in the Netherlands has said it has no authority to hand over Chile's land, and said it will not say what the outcome of the negotiations will be.
That the ICJ decision is made only six months after hearing the final arguments indicates that the case was not difficult, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The previous four years had not yet supported Bolivia's cause, but had only delayed matters.
"The Bolivian government is now interfering with unwanted access to the sea", said Zárate.
He pointed out that Morale had ended any Chilean kindness because of his harsh words.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will be ready to resume negotiations, but it will be even more difficult to hold negotiations afterwards.
Since 1962, no country has assigned a second ambassador.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, called the urgency of the council's decision too great.
He said that Monday will give Bolivia "a unique opportunity to establish new ties with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict so that both countries can benefit".
Calzadilla denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most prominent citizens - was using the sea issue to advance political causes.
"Bolivia will not give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The court's decision will give us an opportunity to see what we need to avoid what happened in the past".
North Korea says it will not stop developing nuclear weapons unless it trusts the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not dismantle its nuclear weapons if it does not trust the United States.
On Saturday Ri delivered a speech to the United Nations General Assembly.
They urged the United States to fulfill the promises it made at the Singapore summit between the two leaders.
He made the remarks as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume talks that ended nuclear arms talks more than three months ago after those held with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
"It is a matter of inquisitiveness", says Ri, "that the unflinching sanctions and the American refusal to declare the Korean War is a cause for North Korea to rejoice.
The U.S. government is worried about accepting the declaration unless the North Korean government (Pyongyang) takes decisive action first to disarm.
The two leaders, Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, are calling for a second summit.
But many doubt that the North Korean Government is really serious about disarming the country, which it probably considers the only way to remain safe.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion festivals reveal that brown hats are on sale in your street
If you want to get more hats and block the sun completely, you will find them only here.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have produced a series of oversized hats for their SS19 collection that left the public stunned at Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram is full of exotic summer hats and these designers have shown their stunning creativity on the floors that models walk through.
The highlight for Valentino was the snow-colored hat with a little sparkle on the heads of the models.
Other grave goods included jewel-encrusted hats, a fancy hat, and even a pencil - but not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also noted that the choice of mask was unusual - made just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One device was like a full-sized scuba diving suit with a snorkel and a brake, and the other was like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you keep storing up a lot of clothing that catches your eye - you are lucky.
Fashion watchers say that soon we will see large hats in stores.
The fig caps will take the 'La Bomba' out of fashion, a very flat hat worn mainly from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The clichéd label that inspires the high-heeled hats so prevalent in the media has given models a new look - beach bags the size of swimsuits worn by models on their shoulders.
Orange-colored raffia bags, with raffia stitches and covered on top with a white leather handle, were a standout piece of beauty in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion enthusiast Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I look forward to seeing big hats and sea bags in stores this coming summer - it may be difficult to get these gray spots because the designers are putting in so much effort.'
John Edward: To be a citizen of the world, you must know languages
Scotland's private schools continue to excel, and this has continued in 2018 with further excellent test results, brought about by individual and team success in sport, the arts, music and other social activities.
These schools, with over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide students and parents with high-quality services.
Private schools seek to prepare students for advanced education, for their chosen careers, and even for their place as citizens of the world.
Just as the education department can prepare and implement its own curriculum, we continue to view the latest talks as popular and popular subjects of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: "When you speak to a person in a language he understands, the words just go to his head.
When you speak to a person in his mother tongue, it reaches his heart".
This is a clear reminder that it is futile to rely on English alone to establish ties and trust with people of other lands.
Starting with the results of the exams of this past year, we see that language is graded higher than other subjects in private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages scored excellent grades.
Scores taken from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored well in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This indicates that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages, as these are vital skills that children and youths will no doubt need in the future.
In the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere, the choice of languages as subjects is not considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons employers gave for not applying for jobs were related to language barriers.
So a great deal of language skills is needed to prepare young people for a bright future in the workforce.
Since many future job opportunities will require the use of languages, this knowledge will be valuable in a world where people are moving abroad.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a good chance in the future to acquire life-long knowledge such as:
The ability to communicate directly with people from other lands gives one who knows several languages a better chance of success than others.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to initiate a sustained conversation and French was the only language spoken by 15 percent of adults.
That is why investing in language learning is now vital for today's children.
Speaking several languages, especially those of developed countries, will equip children for good opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, schools do not teach the same languages.
Many schools will focus on more advanced languages now, while others will teach languages considered more important in Britain in preparation for the summer of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preference, there will always be a choice of languages in private schools, where teachers are experts in those languages.
Scotland's private schools are committed to providing an education that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, wherever they find themselves in the future.
Now it cannot be denied that for a country to have a bright future, languages are of great importance in foreign-language activities, and that should be reflected in education.
Indeed, the latter languages should be understood as "the art of communicating with foreigners".
Private schools are leading the way in giving young people in Scotland this choice, unlike the elite.
It must be done.
John Edward director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The moment fans have been waiting for to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time has arrived.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said that James will play in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the length of time will still be decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", according to Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was interviewed about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
I don't need pre-season training games to be ready and in control
It's time for Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins his campaign for the election tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia
It is the first of five trips planned for next week, including visits to friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote now on hold to fill a vacancy in the Senate, Trump is determined to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are on the verge of losing Congress in the November election.
What time is the Trump West Virginia evening and how is it viewed?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia parade is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump may make a speech to the Supreme Court this week during the Brett Kavanaugh trial, which has been tense as rape charges are brought up because of a two-week suspension of the confirmation vote for the FBI to investigate.
But the aim of this series of trailers is to help Republicans facing a tough challenge in the November elections to improve their standing.
That's why this campaign of voter mobilization and the five artists next week aim to "motivate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
Congressional authority is so important to his agenda that the president has come to many places he can reach during busy election season, Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening show will likely draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be presented in small venues by Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, this time he has received more than 40 percent votes in 2016
Trump has been trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who fell behind in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is going to try to help him in the election", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup Team USA shows strength to fight for confidence in falling singles on Sunday
After three one-way rounds, Saturday's rounds may be just what the Ryder Cup needed
The status and prestige of the sport do not stop in another category, but this is what the players know and, especially in competitions of this kind.
Where will they say the army has gone?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so I think we're going with that lead", said Jordan Spieth as he embarked on his day trip.
Europe has a chance, however, with four points in front and there are twelve more to play.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel a lot of grit and a lot of motivation, not like Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasted three points out of four.
Spieth has been dangerous from hitting the ball sitting on the tee to the flag and is an example to others.
Those cheers went up as he advanced in his division, scoring a valuable run to take the game to four points for all while he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt that got them into the game at 15 and they cheered him on, is an announcement that he believes the American team is not out of the competition.
"You have to be tough, and watch your game", said Spieth.
That's what's left for these players now
18 holes to identify
The players with the most points over Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable Ryder Cup story.
Both are unusual but lovely from the viewpoint of four and they can't go wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple who did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That excitement, and the enthusiasm from them to the fans, leads to a strong team on Sunday, and there will be no more famous player to complete the European creation by sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It would be good if it happened at the same time in different pits
But the European languages of creation are almost urgent
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson caught Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball champion, while he was playing alongside Alex Noren
A bogey and two of the nine front boulders pushed a Spaniard and a Swede into a ditch from which they could not escape
On Sunday, even when there is no one to help you out of your hole
Fourballs and four-players are fun to watch up close because of the way both teams work together, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a pit can be turned in a flash.
Europe have played well in the group stage so far and have a good lead on the final day but this four-player series has shown that Team USA has the strength to fight a battle that others, especially Stateside, still do not believe.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead into the Ryder Cup final
Europe will take advantage of the good lead in the Ryder Cup final after Saturday's good fourball game and a 10-6 lead against the USA.
The two leading scorers Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari set themselves up with two wins against Tiger Woods who was shooting from behind to take their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Europe's Thomas Bjorn team, still in the hunt for the trophy it had been stripped of two years earlier, had pushed a losing American team to the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The United States were in the lead in four games, winning two, but they couldn't cut the score.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 unity games to win the cup
Fleetwood is the first European to score four consecutive points, and along with Molinari, they are nicknamed Molliwood after a great weekend's play by the two pair who won four points from the first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they teamed up with Shashara Woods and newcomer Bryson Dechambeau in a 5-4 victory.
Woods, who was out for two games on Saturday, was showing signs of form but lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and four and seven respectively.
Justin Rose, who took a break from the morning's fourballs, returned to play alongside Henrik Stenson in the four games and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 who were ranked first and third in the world.
Europe was not alone in its excitement, even though their game was a pleasant, cool sunny southwest of Paris
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored a two-point lead on Saturday.
They recovered the 2&1 lead they had gained from the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter on fourballs and returned to shake Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 on the foursomes after losing the first two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point lead to get into a playoff game, though the Furyk team champions needed to play hard enough to defend the trophy.
After two days of both, the lamb seems unable to burn itself
North Korea says they will not abandon their weapons on their own without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister warned the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are undermining their trust in the United States and that the country can never abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important social steps" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing nuclear test facilities, and taking a pledge not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in America there can be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances we cannot put our own weapons first".
Although Ri made similar arguments about Washington's decision to phase out nuclear weapons that would reward North Korea for the actions it had taken, his speech was significant because it did not deny the nuclear weapons themselves as Pyongyang had traditionally denied.
Ri spoke at the joint speech of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work towards denuclearization on the Korean peninsula while Trump reassured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long demanded an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons
Washington has also been hesitant to lift heavy sanctions on North Korea
"The United States is pushing for the immediate dismantling of nuclear weapons and increasing pressure on the sanctions to achieve their goal, and to oppose the declaration of war", Ri said.
The idea that the sanctions will bring us down is just a dream for people who don't know us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for the second Kim-Trump meeting that the American leader had mentioned earlier this week.
The minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in five months ago and added: "If it was East Korea that was in the nuclear talks and not the United States, then the nuclear talks would be a no-brainer".
However, Ri's speech was quite different from last year's, in which he told the U.N. General Assembly that a rocket attack on the United States was inevitable after President Trump's "offence" called Kim a suicide rocket.
This summer at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with nuclear destruction, congratulated Kim for taking the bold step of denuclearization, but said much work still needed to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying whether it would take two years, three years or months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must pay Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue forcefully and without hesitation until we have a stable, verified nuclear disarmament situation".
The Security Council has been increasing sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block the financing of missile and other weapons purchases.
Pompeo met with Ri on four sides at the U.N. General Assembly and said he would later visit Pyongyang again next month to organize a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful
He visited Pyongyang in July, claiming a major project was complete, but within hours North Korea accused him of making criminal demands
North Korea pledged at a summit with Moon this month that they would destroy the missile and nuclear space if the US also implemented the mandatory measures.
He said Kim had told him that the "necessary steps" he wanted were the security guarantees Trump had vowed to implement while in Singapore as well as steps to restore good relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn by taking adequate rest
A new study at Harvard University this year is asking all undergraduates to sleep more in order to break the habit of those with more experience drinking caffeinated drinks to read all night.
The teacher found that students at a prestigious university were uninformed about basic self-care
Charles Czeisler, Professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and employed at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted the study, which he believes is the first of its kind in America
She was motivated to start the study after she was distracted by the effect sleep deprivation can have on learning
At the end of it, a girl came to me and said: "Why not tell me about this now, this summer I'm already in the course of elders
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph
This course, introduced to students for the first time this summer, explains to students the importance of good sleep in studies and sports, as well as improving their overall quality of life.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services, said the university decided to bring the study after discovering that students were sleep-deprived during the week.
The hour-long study included a series of collaborative activities
In one section is a drawing of the dorm room, where students are pressing coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and glamour and how not sleeping can make the player less active, and the importance of having a bedtime clock
In one case, the investigators estimate that lack of sleep can cause heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A compass map, and signs indicating conversations, then encourage participants to reflect on their daily activities.
We know it won't change student habits immediately
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the consequences of choosing to smoke cigarettes,Prof Czeisler added
The practice of night-swimming is still prevalent, he stressed, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleeplessness will be rampant
Making sure you get enough, quality sleep, must be the student's secret weapon to prevent stress, fatigue and mood disorders, he said - and also prevent obesity, because not sleeping makes the brain starve, makes it tired all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physics biologist, helped Professor Czeisler organize the study, after attending one of the classes last summer during his first year at Harvard.
She said that the study opened her eyes and moved her to do a course that will be open to the public on campus
The next step, he hopes, will be to invite all undergraduates to attend a similar course before they go to competitive institutions.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider setting alarm clocks for going to bed, as well as for waking up, and be aware of the dangers of blue light from electronic devices on the screen, which can cause you to lose sleep rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: A point from Menga knocks Gerrard's men to the ground
Rangers found themselves in danger again when they were beaten in their dance match when a shot by Dolly Menga hit the net in Steven Gerrard's team's meeting, losing 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox were looking for their first win at home since last February when they won 4-1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holts gave Gerrard their second hat-trick in 18 games as coach to leave the team eight points behind in the Ladbrokes Premiership lead.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers were not in a position to score.
While Rangers dropped to sixth, Livingston moved up to third and trailed Hibernian by points.
And there may be more trouble for the Rangers after Attorney Calum Spence had to be rescued after he sustained a head injury, he was hit by a bullet in the head.
Gerrard made eight goals in the team that defeated Ayr to advance to the quarter-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, took the Livi 11 that scored at Hearts last week and he must be happy to follow the way his team was playing well, pushing them to do it all the time.
The Rangers could have been the best catchers, but Livingston used the opportunity to catch the ball better
They would have scored in the second minute of the game when Menga gave Scott Pittman the ball and put him ahead of Allan McGregor's numbers but the midfielder was when he threw away the big opportunity
Keaghan Jacobs sent a free kick which earned captain Craig Halkett but his teammate Alan Lithogow was the one who threw it away from the back count.
The Rangers tried to compete but they were not very promising on the part of the players.
Alfredo Morelos admitted that he must have got a penalty after fifteen minutes during the time he and Steven Lawless clashed but the referee said the game would go on despite the Colombian protest.
Rangers only managed to score twice in the first half of the game but former Ibrox midfielder Liam Kelly was still hampered by headers Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Levi's point in the 34th minute came unexpectedly, no one can deny that they were entitled to it simply because of their performance.
The Rangers also failed to defend Jacobs' pit set.
Scott Artfield was not shaken when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who took his time before passing it to Menga who put it in the net.
Gerrard worked the interim to move Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the decision almost immediately changed the situation as the winger drowned Morelos but Kelly appeared to run out of line to defend.
But Livingston made the tourists play their favorite game, Lithgow and Halkett repeatedly throwing long balls
The Holt team could have increased their lead in the last minutes but McGregor stopped to block Jacobs's ball before Lithgow hit it head-on and passed the numbers from the corner.
Rangers outfielder Glenn Middleton had another opportunity to make a penalty shootout when he leaned on Jacobs but again Thompson was not looking at him.
Calendar: The discoverer of the Geiger Counter
Now page from the Calendar  Sunday Morning: October 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, COUNTING....the day on which the eminent scientist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany
Geiger came up with the idea of observing and measuring radioactivity, a technique that eventually led to the invention of the Geiger Counter.
This has been a pioneer in science ever since, with Geiger Counter also pioneering pop music, as featured in the film Bells of Colorado, where scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are parodied
What is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger Counter, used to look for radioactive particles, such as uranium.
When you plug these pages in, you will hear radioactive atoms being ejected from the washing machine
Evans: They're eating the ground!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday
But the manuscript bearing his name has survived.
A new cancer cure could teach the immune system to detect inaccurate immune systems
New cancer treatment could train the immune system to detect inaccurate immune systems that can kill
Treatment teaches the immune system to recognize the wrong immune system as part of treatment
The image shows the patient's immune system being developed in a laboratory
They will now be able to see the protein that comes from many of the shells and then replicate it
A trial drug shows promising signs for cancer patients
One woman who took a course, one that trains the immune system to detect defective immune systems, saw the cancer in her uterus disappear for over 18 months.
The technique involves extracting antibodies from the patient, preparing them in the laboratory to see which protein is present in many diseases called HER2, and then re-staining the antibodies.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings indicate that we have a very promising cure".
HER2 is responsible for the development of many types of tumors, including gonorrhea, uterine fibroids, thyroid, and thyroid, explained Professor.
The same method of extracting immune cells from a patient and training them to follow the immune system of a cancer patient has worked to treat a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West enters a campaign to speak out about Trump's values, wearing a MAGA hat, after appearing on SNL.
When they are going to work
Kanye West was interviewed on Saturday Night Live after dancing at a rally, denouncing American values, President Donald Trump and saying he would run in the 2020 election.
After singing a song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he caused a stir among Democrats who later rallied his support for Trump.
I often talk to white people and they say: "How do you like Trump, you have a racist attitude?
If I had any concerns about racism I would have traveled to America a long time ago, a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the program by showing a sketch of Matt Damon where he jokes about Brett Kavanaugh as he stands before the Senate Judicial Committee under the sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not broadcast, the video of West's performance was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make a joke about West by throwing it.
West also complained to the press that the steak was not tasty because of his cap
They abused me behind the stage.
They said, "You will not go out there with that hat on".
They have defrauded me!
They still can't sink, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to go to the deep end?" and said he was going to throw away his Superman jacket, because that means you can't do anything to me.
Try the love.
His speeches caused the speakers to be surgically operated on, at least twice, and the program staff seemed humiliated, Variety reported, with one person shedding light, The entire studio was silent and shook
West was brought in at the last minute when Ariana Grande, another former Mac Miller star, passed away a few days ago.
West surprised many when she danced I love it, dressed as Perrier Bottle
West responded to TPUSA party leader Candace Turner on Twitter: To one of the militant: THANK YOU FOR WITH THE COUNT
But contestant Karen Hunter who tweeted that West was introducing herself, and that's a good thing.
But I prefer not to pay anyone (for buying his music or clothes or not supporting his art) who I think supports and speaks about political values that are harmful to the people around me.
You have freedom.
And so it is with us, he added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, better known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion and the late rapper Prince, changed his name to Symbol and renamed himself the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington exposes the practice of insulting the characters
Kit Harington is known for wielding a sword when he played Jon Snow in the HBO animated series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has rejected the prevailing belief that a warrior must be a man, saying that those roles make boys violent to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed something had gone wrong and asked how the gender emphasis could be corrected in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married fellow actress Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones, also 31, admitted that she felt a sense of urgency about the subject.
"I feel like I'm on fire right now, where did we go wrong with this sex-oppression thing?" she said.
What are we teaching men as they grow older, about the masculinity we see now?
Kit believes that TV is contributing to the rise of this gender-pressured violence, caused by the players in the ring.
He continued: What are the things that a person learns from and learns from?
What is taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel sidelined by this kind of manhood?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we answer this?
Because there's obviously something wrong with boys
In the interview, he said that he is not returning to Game of Thrones, that when the series ends next summer, he has finished with the battlefields and the horses
From November Kit will be starring in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a cartoonist and his brother, a serial killer.
The actor said he saw his meeting with his wife Rose as the greatest wound he received on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife here on this program, and in that way you gave me my family, and my life from here", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who had captured the attention of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning drama.
The two were married in June 2018 in the courtyard of Leslie's home in Scotland
HIV/AIDS China reports 14% increase in new cases
China is reporting a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
At least 40,000 cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are of sexual assault, which brings a change of circumstances compared to the past.
Typically, HIV spreads more rapidly in certain areas of China because of infected blood.
But the number of people infected in this way had decreased and was almost zero, health officials said at a meeting held in Yunnan province.
Every year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious concern for LGBT groups.
Homosexual relationships were legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBTs is entrenched
Because of the practices that impede decision-making, surveys have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of these infections are caused by inadequate sexual immunity in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide HIV medicines to all as part of the solution.
Maxine Waters denies that the work provided information to GOP signatories, exposes dangerous lies and fraud
U.S. On Saturday Rep. Maxine Waters flatly denied allegations that a member of her staff had uploaded the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat has said with full conviction that the speeches are being propagated by pundits and right-wing websites.
Writing on Twitter, Waters said: It is a lie, a lie of the blue.
The information provided reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an anonymous Capitol Hill reporter during the Senate hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual abuse.
This information was provided after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the person who sent the information identified Waters' office and removed the employee information from Waters.
Waters continued: "These speeches are lies, gross lies".
"My colleague - whose identity, personal information, and security were exposed through the fraud and these slander - would not give out that kind of information.
These baseless speeches are a lie, a green lie".
Waters' speech was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: "His refusal is a sign of anger.
"This shows that he has no heart to be a Member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he does not have to get angry.
They should not be stubborn.
They should not question the motive of the accuser.
They should be calm and calm".
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' response to what Democrats criticized of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics said appeared to be very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Morepublican candidate seeking to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections also expressed his views on Twitter.
"This is a big story if it's true", he wrote on Twitter.
In his speech, Water said that his office had notified the appropriate authorities and the legal authorities of these lies.
He continued: "We will make sure that these instigators are exposed, and that they receive legal punishment for their destructive actions and put any of my colleagues at risk".
Summary of Johnny English Strikes Again - a silent film adaptation of one by Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look at the importance of Brexit in any new film from a British perspective and seems appropriate for the revival of the Johnny English comedy spoof franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the ridiculous plots to punish the dog for this senselessness be a new opportunity for the nation to export?
Despite the circumstances, the handsome Johnny English miraculously got his license renewed for the second time - a name that makes a joke about the appearance of the wounds that are not intended for non-English-speaking movie lovers.
He is a foolish but ambitious figure who played a part in Clouseau's Mr Bean and his fellow bandmates' one-note rendition of Chariots of Fire in London at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.
He also initially imitated the traveler and mystery man Atkinson who had previously been played in forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, leaving problems in his past.
There is one or two good things about JE that have come out recently.
I like Johnny English approaching the helicopter in his old uniform and the bentonite is lying on his lapel.
Atkinson's gift for comic roles has been shown, but the comic act sounds less comic and unnecessary, especially since the genre of hardcore films such as 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently portray comics as a central element.
It seems that the comedy is for children and not adults, and to me the humorous tragedy of Johnny English is not as creative and captivating as the silent movies of Atkinson with the kindness of Bean.
The monsoon showers are evidence that Great Britain is now in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has broken into Britain's biggest spy ring, naming all British spies on duty, much to the surprise of the spies on duty - unfortunately Kevin Eldon has played little part.
Just look at the self-righteous prime minister who is a political hero: Emma Thompson does her best to imitate the kindness of Teresa-May but there is little to write about her.
His advisers feel that he should go and get a retired man, since they have finished with all the spies.
And this means that the amazing Johnny English himself, who is now hired as a head teacher at a private school, but giving lessons without being recorded is a way to hide the hype: good movies here as English promises the School of Rock spy academy.
English is quickly taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets his impatient former partner Bough, whose role is played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the captain of a submarine, the role of a girl with a dull temper where Vicki Pepperdine is wasting time.
So Batman and Robin, who are used to badly missing Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in force, meeting the charming Ophelia Bulletova of Olga Kurylenko.
When the prime minister is caught in the dangerous trap of a billionaire technologist with a fluent language, who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the miserable Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of stunning twins, disguising themselves as janitors, lighting a fire in a French restaurant; they start a crime by sneaking into the surrounding ship Volta; and English starts a riot when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the breaks are left for this final episode, but despite the friendliness and the chaos, there is still that little TV in the middle of it all.
It really is not.
After watching some of Johnny English's films I wondered: Is the British film industry giving Rowan Atkinson a role that is worthy of her talent?
Trade unions reject the proposal for British workers to work four days for five paid days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will be looking at a major initiative that would ensure that Britons work four days a week - but get paid five days.
The party reportedly wants executives to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
That could mean three-day weekends - but still pay another day.
These sources say that the idea would 'go hand in hand' with the party's economic goals and plans to transform the country for the benefit of the workers.
The four-day work week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic reforms.
A prominent Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'It is expected that before the end of this summer a change in policy will be announced.
'This will not happen overnight but working four days a week is a desire that is consistent with the party's approach to balancing the national economy on the benefit of labour as well as the party's overall industrial policy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such a proposal, as the Green Party pledged during the 2017 national election campaign to run four days a week.
However, this desire is currently not recognized by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Four-day work week is not the party's policy, and it is not an issue being discussed by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour party meeting to examine his view of socialist economic reform.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to deprive 'characterless managers' and 'spoilers' of power in the firms.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not receive all their money as the Labour government may 'withdraw funds' due to a mistaken belief that it was made.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up a Joint Stock Fund to put 10 per cent of private firms' shares into the hands of workers, who could receive interest distributed in the summer of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court at least in its entirety, raising questions as to whether the panel's findings would change the minds of any Republican members to give no support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could produce anything that would lead to a change of heart.
Kennedy appeared to a colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, I understand", said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, that is, the charge came out, and said, 'Did you do this thing?'
He was harsh, gnashing his teeth, not recognizing lambs and lambs".
Graham's vote, however, seemed unlikely to be reversed.
"I've made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it will take a strong indictment to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied yellow", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone who talks about it can prove it.
Thirty-six years have passed.
I see something new that can change".
What Is the Global Citizen Celebration, and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual summer music festival in which many real music stars dance and whose goal is also interesting: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy the music of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a development of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people taking action to combat it.
To get a free ticket to the concert (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to perform certain acts, or steps such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to world leaders, making phone calls, or doing anything to help inform others of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal 12 years from now?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert tickets a fair way to motivate people to want action, or is it just another form of clicktivism or "clicktivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has reported more than 19 million moves by its supporters, with many different motives.
It says these measures have helped to motivate world leaders to announce their commitments and policies of some $37 billion that are designed to affect the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has received 390 commitments and announcements resulting from the actions it has taken, with at least $10 billion of the fund either approved or paid.
The group estimates that to date the funds received have directly affected the lives of some 649 million people worldwide.
Other key committees include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. alliance of investors committed to helping children grow to their full potential", promising to help Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can end the social injustice of malnutrition", The Power of Nutrition spokesperson Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 steps to call on the U.K. to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced a fund for a project, Nutrition Power, that will provide 5 million women and children with nutrition.
In answer to one of the questions and answers on its website, it asks: "What makes you think we can end hunger?"
"It will be a long and steep journey - at times we will stumble and fall", said Global citizen.
But like the great human rights organizations and the anti-apartheid resistance that came before us, we will succeed, because power is unity.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this summer's New York festival, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to "block" Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
"If necessary, the US government could use the Navy to block Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, put it by US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Russia's involvement in the Syrian war - where it has sent troops supplied by the ruling government - is just a ploy to find new energy markets, Zinke says.
He reportedly said: "I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy as they did in eastern Europe, in southern Europe".
And according to this official, there are ways to combat this.
He said: "The United States has the ability to use its Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary to block, to ensure that their energy does not go to the markets.
Zinke was speaking to those attending a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that has established itself as the "consumer advocate" for energy in the United States.
He goes on to compare the U.S. government's dealings with Russia and Iran, saying that they are basically equally successful.
"For economic reasons Iran and Russia may choose to cut the border and switch fuel", he said, referring to Russia as "another dumb ass" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is planning to boost its exports of natural gas produced in Europe, which will displace Russia, which sells to European buyers in escrow.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "false" Nord Stream 2 project, which, according to Trump, has caused Moscow to attack Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the purpose of which is to increase the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is merely a commercial project.
The Russian government maintains that the reason why the US Government opposes the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree on the point that energy is not a weapon of oppression and that consumers are free to choose their own suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak put it after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's approach has been called monkey after monkey, as Germany has vowed to continue supporting the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and the agreements reached between the German and Russian Governments.
"I am very concerned when another country is interfering in our energy matters", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senate member Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she will seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider suicide.
"It is time for women to take the reins of government in Washington and fix our broken government, led by a woman", according to The Hill, she put it.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren dismissed President Donald Trump from the city hall, saying he was "destroying this country".
"I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he says.
Warren openly denounced Trump as well as his nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "we need FBI investigations before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren's constituency do not think he should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts' likely voters want the senator to not run.
Thirty-two percent support his resignation.
Polls show that the majority support former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent voting for him, and 48 percent against the decision.
Other prominent Democrats who have been mentioned as potential candidates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about the PTSD of Track Palin at the Donald Trump party conference
Track Palin, 26, spent the summer in Iraq after being recruited in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Montaha night
"What happens to my son, what happens to him after he returns, is similar to the effects of PTSD that some families experience and our soldiers come back with emotional wounds", he told the crowd at Donald Trump's party rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin says that her imprisonment "is a problem that people don't want to talk about" and that her son and other veterans, "come back different, come back strong, come back wondering if there is any respect for what other soldiers and air force, and every other member of the military, have sacrificed for their country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and carrying a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy to deny victims of gang or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 American states and territories headed a report on the policy on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal government's policy has not been disclosed.
She said her husband "and the sons of members of his gang", had abused her but U.S. government officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Government agents who support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as the countries with the highest number of U.S. asylum applications, since those countries face persistent problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overrides a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented refugees fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "is in violation of state, federal [American] and international law".
"The UN law requires that all asylum applications be reviewed according to the facts and circumstances of each application, and that prohibition violates that principle", according to the policy-makers' report.
Moreover, the agents reported that the policy of not allowing refugees into the U.S.A. could lead to economic downturn, saying that the people could start their own businesses or "do important work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered refugee officials to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or violent gangs in June.
"Asylum is available to those who have fled their home countries because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said on June 11 when announcing the policy.
Asylum was by no means meant to eliminate all problems - even the most serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts are underway in Palu as the death toll increases and survivors are sought
The survivors were in a difficult situation.
"There is tension", says a 35-year-old mother named Risa Kusuma, as she delivers her son to the rescue center in the affected city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance is bringing in the bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes picking up their wet wounds, trying to save whatever they could give.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals were overwhelmed by the devastation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken her back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of the effects of the disasters.
Tears rolled down his cheeks as he related his feelings when a powerful earthquake shook the five-story hotel room in which he, his wife, and their daughter were staying.
"There was no time to run.
I was crushed by the crumbling rubble of the collapsed walls", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended the wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but she was silent!
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' with 'false advertising'
A week after a major Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad about America disparaging the benefits of mutual trade between America and China, the American ambassador accuses the Chinese Government of using the American publication to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday commented on the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on Oct. 6, an accusation China denies.
Trump's criticism of the Chinese government for interfering in the US election is consistent with what US government officials told Reuters is a new phase of the US government's accelerated campaign to suppress China.
While it is common for foreign governments to promote trade, the Chinese and the U.S. Governments compete fiercely in trade matters, raising import taxes.
China's retaliatory tax payments were intended to punish states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, say experts on China-U.S. relations.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said the Chinese Government has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register of Sunday that China "is now in the middle of a mess by deliberately putting false advertisements on our free printing press".
"To spread these lies", Branstad wrote, "the Chinese government has adopted the popular American tradition of free speech and free printing by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register".
"On the other hand", he says, "if you walk down this Beijing street, you will find few expressions of dissatisfaction and you will not see the real reaction of the Chinese people to China's depressed economic situation, because the media is dominated by the iron fist of the Chinese Communist Party".
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers dared to publish his article, though he did not say which one.
Republicans Ban Women Voters Before Midterm Elections in the Kavanaugh Crisis, Analysts Warn
As prominent Republicans unite to defend Congress nominee Brett Kavanaugh who faces multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that many women will feel, especially during the upcoming midterm elections.
This is a very sensitive issue, and most Republicans have shown themselves unwilling to vote.
Those are not injuries to be ignored", Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he does not believe that the attempts to get Senateman Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) off the FBI's investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, even in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokeswoman for the MoveOn group, put it as Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, activists shouted "Red is coming!" as they protested in the Senate corridor as the Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee voted to continue appointing Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic's report.
"The zeal and motivation for democracy will be the ultimate", says Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political commentator, in the news.
"People say this is a very important issue; it is true.
It may be even more important, especially among the unstable urban female voters and the younger voters, 18-29 years of age, who, though they do not like the president, are less likely to vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the racial discrimination charges against the Supreme Court nominee, a critic says it would be self-defense if the Republicans continued to assert that.
"This has been a frustrating blow to the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not so much a matter of the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets on the judges' list, it's a matter of how the Republicans treat that woman", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic-election campaign group, told the media.
However, Americans seem divided as to whom to believe when the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh emerges, with many supporting Kavanaugh.
A new poll conducted on YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents actually pay or possibly believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they actually or possibly believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent thought as did Ford.
Following Flake's strong suggestion, the FBI is now investigating the charges brought by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to a report in The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that when he was 17 years old Kavanaugh, who was drunk, abused him.
Ramirez laments that a Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party during their Yale studies in the 1980's.
World Wide Web Designer Plans to Launch a New Internet that Competes with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a program that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
This latest project by a technology expert, called Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's open-pit Solid platform.
Solid gives users the choice of where their data is stored and what information is allowed to be accessed.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now is the time to act", he said of organization.
"It is a historic moment".
This app uses Solid technology to give people the opportunity to start their own "personal online data warehouse" or POD.
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal or professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify and is available for online searches at the same time.
A unique feature of personal online databases is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "information empowerment".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the goal of Inrupt is for the company to develop the resources, methods and expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform bought by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a team of volunteers writing computer code.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create open-source apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with "Facebook and Google whether or not to initiate a complete overhaul where all aspects of their business are completely re-managed.
"We do not ask their permission".
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "[Inrupt's] purpose is to generate business dynamism and collaboration to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website based on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a major influence in the debate over whether Internet service providers should be more selective.
Even if he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added: "I look forward to the future of what the web will be like.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross winner in World War I honored with a ceremony
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honored at a ceremony in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was shot dead by a sniper in hiding four days later without ever knowing that he had won Britain's highest military award.
Two of his younger brothers unveiled a memorial stone at the Rushden procession, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
His great-grandson, another shaman, Michael Vann, said that it was a "special memorial" to the 100th anniversary of his great-grandfather's heroic victory.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led a thousand soldiers or battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "despite the thick fog and the strong smoke from the battlefield and the mortars".
Later he hurried to the battle line and with "immense courage" led the line to attack with one single gun and shot down three of the enemy's army.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper in hiding on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says that the actions of his stepfather are "something I will never get over but that makes me feel thin".
She and her brother, Dr. James Vann, also planted flowers after the procession, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feels very humiliated to have taken part in that march" and added that "the courage of a real warrior is shown by the support that the masses will give".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Peppa Pig
Imagine spending the whole night watching Bellator 206 packed and missing the opportunity to see the main event.
The series from San Jose featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to shake hands, UK broadcasters were left with the man in the mats when the broadcast switched and Peppa Pig entered.
Some were annoyed that they had stayed up all night just to watch the fight.
One Twitter user described the response to the broadcast by uploading children's dolls as "playing the game".
"It's a state policy that at 6 a.m. the broadcast was not appropriate so they had to play a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked why the change was made.
"Peppa the pig, really".
Bellator president Scott Coker says they will be handling their own arrangements to include UK brewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replaying the game, I think maybe something can be done", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we can't do anything until Sunday, our time, when it's Monday for them.
But we are still working on this issue.
To be honest, when the switch was turned off, there were a lot of messages being sent and they were all offensive.
We tried to repair the wounds, thinking that it was a technical problem.
But no, it was a government matter.
I want to promise you that this will not happen again in the future.
We will arrange five fights instead of six - as in the past - we tried to make an effort for the fans but we overdid it.
We are sorry for what happened".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was proud of his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley has often been compared to others because of his gender - but that motivated him to pursue success.
This 24-year-old says that it was not until he went to high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs as host Lauren Laverne, she spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made us not care so much about winning Olympic medals.
The regular presenter of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, has been absent from work for several months because of illness.
Appearing as a cast member on the first episode of Laverne, Daley said she felt "below everyone else when she was grown up because "it was not acceptable in society to like boys and girls".
"To this day", he says, "this feeling of inferiority, of being different, has been a real source of strength and determination for me to succeed".
They wanted to prove that he was "something else", so that he would not be the final judge when they finally found out his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist is a prominent LGBT rights activist and has used her presence at this summer's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries not to discriminate against gays.
He said he spoke because he considered himself lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that dating a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she partnered with in 2013 - "screwed me up".
Daley married an Oscar winner, who was 20 years her senior last year, but she says age is not a problem.
"When you go through a lot of trouble as a child" - she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she says it was hard to find someone her age who had gone through the same problems.
The couple became parents in June, of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "view of things" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, the main thing was 'I have to win the gold medal,'" he says.
"Truth be told, there are things more valuable than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie".
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father was still struggling to accept that he was dying and that one of the last things he had asked for was tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first line.
"I couldn't say, Dad, you can't be in the front row", she said.
"When he stopped breathing I was holding his hand and it was only after he stopped breathing completely and died that I believed he was not suffering from anything", she said.
The following summer, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had been longing for all my life - to jump in front of my own nation at the Olympic Games, I felt overjoyed", she says.
That inspired the first song of her choice - Proud for Heather Small - which touched her emotions as she prepared for the Olympics and kept her energized.

Retired golfer Mickelson sits on a bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to show that he is also hot so that the experience is not bad.
Mickelson, who played in the second-ever summer tournament to set a record for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk in the fourball and foursomes golf games on Saturday.
Instead of drawing, as has been the case in the United States, a five-time major winner spends part of the day as a major draw and part of the day improving his game in the hope of making up for his losses.
The 48-year-old never hit the ball with the drivers and even when he was running, he was not strong enough for the Le Golf National game with the squash, where long balls often beat fast balls.
And if the game itself isn't scary enough, in Mickelson's ninth game on Sunday, he faces the unfailing British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who accompanies the new Tommy Fleetwood to the main draw, to win all of their matches this week.
If the four-point Americans start 12 games with a scoreless start, Mickelson's play could prove to be truly valuable.
Furyk showed that he trusted his partner, not that he was being unreasonable.
"He fully understands the role he plays today, he grabbed me by the shoulder and kissed me and told me that he would be ready tomorrow", says Furyk.
"She is very brave.
He is the Superstar of the game and has played a big part in these teams last time, and this week.
I never saw him play two games.
I expected a lot, but that's how it happened and we thought it was right.
He wants to be seen, like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may be his last game in the Ryder Cup that does not match the record he has set.
Mickelson won 18 games, lost 20 and played in a tie in seven, but Furyk said his presence brings benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, and likes to make fun of people, and it's nice to have that kind of personality in a group", she explained.
"I think the young people who play with him enjoy his presence, and his week, which is something I was happy to see.
His value is not limited to playing".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that over-equipment can disappear in an instant
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows the danger of his being so far ahead in the final day's games at the Ryder Cup that he suddenly finds himself behind.
The Dane made his first appearance in a game in 1997 at Valderrama, in a team captained by Seve Ballesteros where the five-point lead against the Americans was completed by a pinch-hit, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but it was only a matter of time before the injury changed", says Bjorn, pictured, after the 2018 team won 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history reminds me and all in that group that it's not over.
Tomorrow we will dive in a little.
Let's go and make the wounds right.
It is not over until you have scored enough points.
We have a goal, to try and win this trophy, and that is what we aspire to.
I always say, I'm concerned about our 12 players, but we know exactly who the players are - the greatest players in the world".
Pleased with the performance of his players in a high-stakes golf match, Bjorn added: "I don't want to put on a stew before the meat is cooked.
We do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Tomorrow people will show themselves, and that's another thing I don't know.
It's nice to work with someone when things are going well, but when you're alone, now your skills as a golfer are completely challenged.
That is a point you should remind athletes to make every effort tomorrow.
Now you leave the other person behind, and you should go and work hard with him".
Unlike Bjorn, the quarterback Jim Furyk will expect his players to improve when playing individually than when with assistants, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself saw both sides in the grand final, where he was part of the team that won at Brookline before finally being defeated when Europe produced the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single thing he said", he said when asked how in 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw had energized the players for the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but don't start with the same intensity as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
As the spindle continues in the same direction, it presses the spins in the middle.
We have arranged for the start of tomorrow and have placed the boys in such a way that we think we can perform some miracle tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the team to qualification and faces Rory McIlroy in the head-to-head match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being other prominent Europeans on the shoulders.
"I chose this team in this order because I think that would cover all the situations", says Bjorn of those he has chosen to play solo.
New German battleships refitted
A new type of German navy was due to be approved in 2014 to replace the battleships of the Cold War, but that will not happen until at least next summer due to inefficient machinery and fluctuating costs, according to German media.
The signing of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first six months of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery hampered the ambitious project.
The Navy ordered four of these Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships back in 2007 and they will replace the aging Bremen-class.
It is understood that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, numerous missiles to fire on aircraft and ships, as well as certain technology that causes the ship to conceal its prey, such as a reduced propeller, radiation and sound signals.
Other important details include times of repair - it will be possible to use new models of ships for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that the latest battleships - purportedly designed to give Germany a powerful navy - will be outdated when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 model of ship suffered a disaster last summer and made headlines when the German Navy refused to use its ship and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivering it.
The reasons for the withdrawal are not well known, but German media reported "several software and hardware codes that rendered the ship useless in battle.
Its software flaws are particularly significant, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-designed ships will have a crew of about 120 - half the crew of the Bremen shipyard.
Also, it was found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and hindered the Navy's ability to implement future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh twice as much as the similar-design ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides structural problems, the cost of the entire ship - including the training of the crew - was also a major issue.
It is said to have frightened people by as much as €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - originally as much as €2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding new shipbuilding become significant in view of recent warnings that the strength of the German navy is dwindling.
Earlier this summer, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of Germany's parliamentary security committee, admitted that the Navy is "in fact running out of combat-ready ships".
The official said that the matter had been ongoing for some time, since the old ships were no longer in use but no new ones had been given.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-designed ships fit into the Navy.
National Trust learns about the private lives of the mothers
A new study conducted on a group of homes in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the marmots use the land to forage for themselves.
It is hoped that the results of the study will shed new light on the behavior of these amazing flying animals and guide future conservation efforts.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common soprano pipistrelle and the long-eared brown and Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be installed at key locations on the site to monitor the marmots' movements throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct online searches using handheld scent-sensing machines.
A professional sound-recording calculator of all the recording machines will detect how often the monkeys sing and what kind of music they make.
Then a map of their habitat and a report will be produced to produce a full understanding of the marmots' behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most valuable habitats for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This knowledge will help to realize the benefits of habitat management work such as establishing strategies and a better way of preserving forested areas for ducks and other species.
Over the past century the population of the frog has declined dramatically in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are threatened by structures and construction projects that affect nests and cause them to become homeless.
Wind turbines and light bulbs can also pose a danger, as can toxic adhesive paper and other chemicals applied to building materials, and even the attack of domestic cats.
In fact, frogs are not blind.
However, as they hunt at night, their ears are more active than their eyes to help them find their prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of opportunity detection to spot insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which oversees the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 historic gardens, and 76,000 acres of land nationwide, takes the monkey very seriously.
It has trained specialists, who regularly conduct investigations, examine nests, and sometimes rescue bats.
The society also set up the first purely crab storage at Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
The farm manager, David Thompson, says that it is a beautiful place for the frogs.
"Here in Threave we have a lot of room for the monkeys", he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and good living facilities.
But there is much about frogs that is still unknown, so our task here and elsewhere will be to help us understand more about how they multiply".
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before building repairs, since it is possible for a man to accidentally destroy one nest of breeding bats and kill 400 females and their young, and possibly all.
Frogs are protected and it is a crime to kill them, abuse them or obstruct them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to recreate the man's resurrection.
"There is so much to learn about the parrot", he said, "and we don't know how most of our animals live".
Ronaldo denies rumors of rape while agents plan to attack a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed the rumors of rape against him as "ghostly", saying people "want to take credit in his name.
His agents are determined to take down the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese goalkeeper and Juventus star was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the matter, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, called the accounts "spiritual".
"No, no, no, no. I was going to go to the bathroom.
What they said today is fantastic", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
"They are seeking to gain glory for my name.
It is a common injury.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's life.
He is a happy man and the wounds are fine", said the actor, smiling.
Ronaldo's agents are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in private", according to Reuters.
Agent Christian Schertz said the actor will seek compensation for "the damaging moral and financial damage and the massive interference in human affairs, which is perhaps one of the most horrific violations of black rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in July 2009 in the rooms of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's bedroom, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed with the Clark City District Council in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he is a "99 percent good boy" and is only "one percent bad".
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sexual relations with the girl, but they agreed.
Mayorga also said that he went to the police and photographs of his wounds were taken at the hospital, but later they settled out of court because he felt "scared to retaliate and afraid that he would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says that she wants to change the agreement because she continues to be frustrated by the incident she is accusing.
At the time of the alleged bet, Ronaldo was about to make his debut for Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he made his debut for the Italian giants Juventus on a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK 'will regret the fuel' as car manufacturers suffer
The UK "would be a burden to itself if it lost its leading position in car manufacturing after Brexit, says Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that "it is also worrying that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain were to absorb from the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese carmaker says that a no-deal Brexit would lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, and 90 percent of them were sold to European Union countries.
"I think if Britain pulls out of the EU by the end of March we'll see production stop at our factory", says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Some UK carmakers have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how commercial border crossings will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will spend a month at its Mini plant in Oxford after Brexit.
The main concerns are what carmakers call supply risks if there is no deal for Britain to leave the EU.
Toyota's production is dependent on the demand at the time, with car parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border cuts that the industry says could result in delays and shortages of vehicle parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that the Prime Minister Theresa May's office's plan for relations with the EU is "carefully thought out to avoid border checks".
"We want to have a great deal that will help us enjoy the present prosperity and even hold onto this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we should be able to continue what has been a highly successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but it warned that the increased costs would reduce the factory's ability to compete and people would lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the organizer of the Unite union at the plant, says that their members are very concerned: "I have learned that once these jobs are over, I never return.
"We have prepared a sound and reliable plan for future relations with the EU", said a government spokesman.
US parliament says Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again
The most important meeting between Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the battle over the nomination of Senate Majority Leader Brett Kavanaugh continues, according to the US Congress on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special agent Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in elections, relations between Trump's aides and Russia, and the possibility of the president obstructing justice.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been debated in the U.S. Senate in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of his being removed from the presidency by a constitutional amendment to change the president.
Rosenstein has denied this account.
But on Monday last week he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that on Thursday there would be a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations, New York.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein and the meeting was adjourned to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee trial in which Kavanaugh and one of his sexual assault accusers, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to spend a week investigating Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about holding a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "If no date has been set, it may be held this week, or it may be postponed for a week according to certain developments in the high court.
But we'll see, I'd like to keep the media informed.
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Interview director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of regular meetings is not because they dislike the TV news show, though he added: "But I can't deny that they like to do the show.
He then explained that direct communication between Trump and the media would increase.
He said: The president holds more Q&A sessions than any other president before him, and added without giving any evidence: We have analyzed those figures.
Meetings will still be held, Sanders said, but if the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that would be better than talking to me.
We try to do that more often and you have seen us do it several times in the last few weeks and that is what will happen at the press conference when you interview the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he holds public talks or has a meeting with visiting dignitaries.
Rarely does one person hold a press conference.
This week in New York, perhaps the president has shown why, by appearing to the assembled press at times in a surprising and unusual way.
A health secretary has written to EU staff at NHS Scotland about the looming Brexit scare.
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the NHS in Scotland to tell them that the country is grateful and wishes them to continue there even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter although less than six months remain before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made a commitment to interest the costs of applications from EU citizens who are posted to work in government departments seeking to be granted local citizenship rights.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "During the summer months, the UK and EU continued discussions on withdrawal, and a decision is expected to be made in the autumn months.
But the UK Government is preparing for the possibility of no deal.
I know this subject may be uncomfortable for you.
That is why I want to emphasize the point that I greatly appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from the EU and elsewhere, make a valuable contribution with their experience and expertise to strengthen and improve the delivery of health services, and this benefits both patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie Surgically Released After Head Injury
Tennessee's Mike Organ reports that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday during a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before the break.
Reed said: He went out to the side of the field and fell there.
Trainees and health workers gave Abercrombie oxygen right there on the side of the field before taking him on a tractor-trailer to be examined.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has returned to surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that the nature and severity of the accident is not yet known and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, a player in his sophomore year, is in his first season playing for Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had five shillings that Saturday before leaving the field, bringing his total to 18 shillings this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying property in the UK and the money will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory system.
This move will undermine Corbyn's success in winning young voters in the years ahead.
Tax revenue will be raised for non-taxpayers in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to invest 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying property in the UK - and that money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's success in winning over young voters in the years ahead by promising affordable housing and high taxes on high earners.
Tax revenue will be raised for individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK, and the money will give the Government the power to fight housing shortages.
The surcharge - paid in addition to the current tax bill, including the surcharge introduced two years ago for secondary and rental housing - may rise to three percent.
The Treasury expects this measure to bring in £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the houses built in London are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices considerably and makes things difficult for first-time homebuyers.
Many affluent neighborhoods in the country - especially in the city - remain empty as many foreign customers spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson made a call for lower tax rates so that more young people can own their own homes.
He criticized large construction firms for driving up land prices, as they buy land but do not use it, and urged Mrs May to abandon the affordable housing policy in order to remedy the housing scandal in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has published a series of interesting proposals for housing reforms, including a system of rental housing and preventing landlords from dismissing a tenant who has not done anything wrong.
He also wants to give government agencies more authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would use my authority as prime minister to revive the British people's dream - to improve the lives of future generations.
And that means fixing our housing problem.
Britain will remain open to those who want to live, work, and live here.
But it would be wrong for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy homes as easily as hardworking Britons.
Many people do not even dream of ever having their own homes and this problem of homelessness is widespread.
Jack Ross: My main ambition is to preside over Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his biggest ambition is to become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is delighted with the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is now in third place in League One, three points short of the top-flight.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer months after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country.
All I found was a B cap, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But as a child I often watched Scotland at the Hampden Stadium with my father, and this always made me run away.
However, that opportunity would only come if I managed to manage the club.
Executives who came before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he is not afraid to join such a famous list and such a big club, having resisted attempts by Barnsley and Ipswich Town to lure him in.
Now I will measure my success by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League?
It should definitely be in the Premier League according to the organisation and management of this club, he said.
 It is not easy to put it in that position, but I would consider myself successful if only I could put it in that position.
Ross has only three years of managerial experience, after spending time as deputy manager at Dumbarton and 15 months training Hearts staff.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier, and in the following season helped St Mirren avoid relegation to the Championship.
Ross says he now feels more at ease than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He remembers picking up the rope to drive Alloa and says: Maybe I was at the crossroads.
I firmly believed that the management job was the best for me, rather than the acting job.
It sounds strange, since I was doing well, earning enough money, and achieving certain things.
But playing is difficult.
There are many things to do each week.
I still have to face the problems of work and the pressure that comes with it but I feel the work of management is fine.
I have always wanted to be a director, and now that I am, I feel more satisfied than I have ever felt in my life.

Research shows that the best time to drink is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat has helped Britain's struggling taverns but has caused problems for restaurants.
Statistics show that taverns had a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurants had a 4.8 percent decline.
Peter Martin, of the CGA, a business consultancy, who compiled the figures, says: "The continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected entry into the World Cup mean that July was the same as the previous June, when sales of tavern products had increased by 2.8 percent, while restaurants were even more down.
The 1.8 percent loss in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
Taverns have performed better than restaurants of similar quality.
Food stalls also suffered during this hot season, though not as badly as restaurants.
It seems that all people wanted to do was go out and drink.
Sales of legal tavern products rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while food dropped by three percent.
"These figures reflect the situation we have seen since the end of April", said Paul Newman, a researcher at the RSM.
Weather and the influence of major events or sports on society influence the sales of products in the business world.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant business continues to struggle, although the 4.8 percent year-on-year loss will be even more devastating as prices rise.
The long hot summer has come at a bad time for food producers and time will tell whether the moderate August heat will improve the situation as expected.
Overall taverns and restaurants, including newly opened ones, had a 2.7 percent increase in July, indicating a decline in the business.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry monitors the UK's tavern and restaurant business and collects and analyses data collected from 47 businesses, which have a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and it is estimated that this situation is an indicator of what is happening in the business.
One in five children has a private social media account that they hide from their parents
A survey shows that 1 in 5 children - some as young as 11 - have a private social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram accounts
This report added to the fear that sexual material was being broadcast there.
20 percent of students say they have a Basic account that they show to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - open a private social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a dramatic increase in fake Instagram accounts - where photos are shared on Instagram.
This report added to the fear that sexual material was being broadcast there.
Twenty percent of the students said that they have a clean Basic account that they show to their parents, but they also have a private one.
A mother who went through her 13-year-old daughter's private account found a teenager insisting that she wanted to be raped.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 per cent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts, and half said they had a private one.
"It is a matter of concern that so many young people are attracted to open online accounts where their parents and teachers cannot find them", said HMC director Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "athletes' spokesman" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director of the governing body at the annual summer general meeting.
Doyle is a Scottish track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for sports broadcasters to benefit from his international experience gained over the past decade.
"Ellidh is highly respected by all athletes in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from having him on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: I am very keen to become a sports advocate and hope to contribute and help run sports in Scotland.
The American who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games as one of his four Olympic gold medals, now a regular on BBC programs, became paralyzed after a stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: Last month I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that it would be seen in time whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but I was sober, learned to walk again, and today I am doing speed jumping!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
An advertisement for a breast milk pump that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the internet
A company that makes breast milk pumps has caused a controversy on the Internet by advertising that compares nursing mothers to cow milk.
Elvie, a technology company, has released a comedy music video to show the freedom that the new breast pump gives mothers who breast-feed their babies, promoting what it calls a "wearable breast pump that boasts a quiet world".
Four mothers dance a song with the following words from a cowherd full of fodder: Yes, I'm a bum, but you can't see the tail and If you can't see these aren't my cow breasts.
The chorus was: Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump I ham the women.
However, the Facebook ad, which was posted by the company, caused a rift on the Internet.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and hundreds have expressed their differing opinions, many saying it alleviates the "problem" of the dairy industry.
"And it is a foolish decision to use cows to promote this product", wrote one.
Like us, they also become pregnant and give birth to young, the only difference being that they steal the young after a few days.
Elvie's mother's milk pump fits nicely into the breast milk of the nursing mother (Elvie/Mother)
Someone said: "It is understandable that this is a matter of concern for both mother and child.
But what is wrong with advertising a breast milk pump for mothers who do not separate from their babies?
One person added: This ad is meaningless.
Some promote the advertisement, and one woman even says that the song makes her laugh.
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have bought it if I hadn't breastfed.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I'm stuck with the message.
One wrote, "This is a good product".
Another says: This is a good advertisement for mothers who pump milk (usually at work or in the kitchen) and feel like cows.
This advertisement neither commends nor condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women are shown dancing with their pumps in their bottles.
This idea is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is quiet, has no wires or bottles, and is invisible inside the uterus, allowing women to move freely with their babies, and to reason while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, deputy ECD at Mother, said: "The Elvie pump is a product so advanced that it deserves special marketing.
By comparing milk-pumping women to dairy cows we want to highlight the issue of milk-pumping and the problems that go along with it, while at the same time illustrating in a delightful way the wonderful freedom that the new system brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two was featured wearing a dress made by Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Foreign Children Sneak into a Texas Campground
The number of immigrant children in foster care has increased despite the fact that the number of people living on the border each month remains unchanged, and the reason is that the strict policies implemented by the Trump administration make it difficult to find sponsors for these children.
Usually, many donors are illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear risk deportation for helping the child.
The situation worsened in June, when government officials announced that people wishing to donate money and other members of their families in the years to come would have to take their fingerprints and that the information would be forwarded to the immigration department.
Last week, Matthew Albence, chief executive of Immigration and Tax Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested a number of people who had applied for asylum.
The organization later said that of those arrested, 70 percent had no criminal record.
Approximately 80 percent of the people who are donors or their families are illegal immigrants, and a large proportion of them are fugitives from crime.
So we are still looking for those people. said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the case, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days as was done in the past, according to the refugee center staff.
Many will present themselves to an immigration judge by video, rather than go to the bar.
Those deemed unfit would be deported immediately.
The long periods of confinement may cause children to become anxious or depressed, causing them to become violent or to try to escape, according to refugee workers and reports that have become prominent in recent months.
Advocates say the problems are even greater in larger communities like Tornillo, where signs of a struggling child may be ignored because of the large distance.
They add that moving children to urban tents without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends makes things even more difficult for many.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been in a state of war for eight years.
Moualem, also a deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops entered Syria illegally because they are fighting terrorism, and that they will be dealt with.
He had to leave immediately without any conditions, and he spoke to the assembly.
Moualem stressed that the War on Terror is nearing its end in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this holy war until it clears all the borders of Syria and eliminates terrorism and illegal troops.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who have gone there to train and advise Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in a war-torn part of the country.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions are better for them to return, and accused other Western countries of spreading unnecessary fear that prevents refugees from returning home.
"We have asked international and humanitarian organizations to help them return home", he said.
 They turn a desperate problem into a political issue.
The United States and the European Union have said they will not provide aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN officials say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to have a neutral zone in the last large rebel-held area of Idlib has opened the door to political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented Russian-led Syrian forces from attacking the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement is "for a specific time" and said he hopes that the military action will be directed at the jihadists, including Al-Qaeda fighters affiliated with the Nusra Front, who will be eliminated.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition representatives to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem gave the conditions under which the Syrian government will join the committee, saying that the task of the commission should be to "examine the elements of the existing constitution" and not to interfere in other matters.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
Thus, Mr. Trump will win again in the 2020 election, unless perhaps many observers hope that he will be removed from the presidency ahead of time because of accusations of dishonesty and slander.
That will undoubtedly be the most shocking presidential end!
At present there are no signs of any interest on the part of the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers of CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and that of MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
On average, Fox News is watched by 2.4 million people, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the night's mainstream with 3.5 million viewers.
"There's something that attracts people because there's something we don't understand", says Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about the secretary of state who became president after the attack that destroyed the state legislature.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", explains the wounds in another way.
He recalls riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because you made me laugh", said the driver, Ms. Scovell said.
There is humor amid the confusion.
Of course, unlike the news on TV, the news in Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrants will reunite with their families or not and the global economy.
Few capable viewers would choose not to watch.
And it's not just about being a good citizen when you find yourself spending six hours watching experts argue that Bob Woodward takes the facts from his book called Fear but hides it from there, that Paul Manafort wears a leopard leather jacket (The Washington Post calls it pride suit) that costs $15,000 and the consequences of Stormy Daniels calling Mr. Trump a phony.
I personally will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
When Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Pawn Stars", talks about Trump's show consistently featuring characters and events that are different (provoking a war with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un), he says: One of the things he does that makes it seem real is that he gives you something every night.
If you miss that one program, you are lost.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's this week, the sun was shining and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was sitting in the house watching MSNBC while at the same time recording CNN.
He could not rise there, as Brett Kavanaugh was to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
Mr. Fleiss said to me: I remember when we were producing all those amazing programs and people were saying, That's when the collapse of Western civilization began.
I thought they were joking, but I see now that they were telling the truth.

Money is pouring in in the intense competition for the middle-choice
Pennsylvania's 17th district, which spends so much money, is not surprising, because of the merger that has resulted in two candidates from the same party in the same district.
The recent merger of Pittsburg counties clashes with Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won election in another county in a special election last year.
Lamb is running against fellow Democratic Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who is currently still representing Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which has taken over much of the new 17th.
New maps were made after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unlawfully divided in favor of Republicans.
The run-up to the elections in the new 17th district has sparked a new campaign of financial strife between the party's main financial backers, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after he emerged with a narrow margin in the closely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th District.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have argued that the Democrats are in a better position.
U.S. Reviews Sanctions on El Salvador or Support for China, and Resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama are accepting Beijing and that Washington is still happy about that.
Mr. Trump held warm talks with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until his colleagues fired the Trump Organization management team.
In a message given earlier this month, Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the branch, said that U.S. Foreign Service officials decided to recall the American ambassadors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of the recent decision to suspend diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
But they were considering imposing sanctions only on El Salvador, which in 2017 the US had given an estimated $140 million in aid, including drug prohibition, rehabilitation and economic support.
The sanctions that were being promoted, including the suspension of financial aid and the denial of certain visas, would make the Central American country more vulnerable to high unemployment and homicide.
While the departments were talking, officials in North and Central America turned the tide of a high-level meeting to discuss security and economic prosperity after a similar meeting held last year was seen as a sign of progress in efforts to curb immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, the high officials insisted on holding a meeting, thus halting any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the summit, scheduled for mid-October, and the delegates say that shows the administration's seriousness.
Three American diplomats returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without carrying threatening or sanctioning messages from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House spokesman declined to provide details of the conversation that three American officials, including two diplomats, discussed, agreeing to discuss the issues discussed as long as they remain anonymous.
Their reports were verified by an outside inspector close to the administration who also did not want to be named.
Learn From History
Another potential source of concern is the report by the special counsel Robert Mueller that Mr. Trump may have perverted justice, which now has ample evidence to support that.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is also turning his attention to investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign has secretly collaborated with Russia from our election floor.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to answer to that body, just as he is preparing to return to the electorate, and perhaps to his colleagues.
There are many uncertainties, and I'm not saying how or how Mr. Trump will fall or see his European allies.
There are decisions that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make that will affect the question of how long you stay.
By 1938, German officials were ready to oust Hitler, provided the Western nations opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia, Munich.
We failed, and we forsook an opportunity that could have spared us many years of bloodshed that followed.
The damage that history has caused depends on such dramatic changes, and the improvement or deterioration of democracy is a result.
Americans are experiencing these dramatic changes in large numbers right now.
What if Mr. Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the same one who is controlling the outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigations?
Rosenstein got into trouble after the newspaper reported that last year, he had suggested that the president be secretly recorded and that he thought he was unfit to be in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times report is false.
What if the FBI's requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair  or if he is left out of the Supreme Court despite sexual abuse charges and evidence of dishonesty?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm congressional elections that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to do this, democracy will be in serious trouble.
But I hope that we will not fail, because of the things I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had previously controlled our country.
He survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, claimed to be a Sabbath-time candle-lighting table with a Nazi symbol.
Would I imagine a bleak future with such a wonderful treasure?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers hopes to win against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and know that beating this Austrian team, after playing a level with Villarreal earlier in the month in Spain, will put it in a good position to qualify from Group G to the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to play last season due to a knee problem until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but believes that will motivate Rangers to work harder.
"It was a good point", said the 31-year-old, "since Villarreal is a strong team.
We went to the game hoping to get something and we came out with a point.
We may win the game, but playing fair is also a good thing.
They played well in the first half, but in the second half we were in control.
On Thursday, too, the European teams will be fighting.
We hope to score three points but that will be a tough game as they won the last game, but with so many supporters I am sure we will work hard and win.
Last summer, things were tough, I was injured and there were changes at the club but now things are better.
The team and the players are happy; the training is going well.
I hope that we will move forward, forget about the past four and succeed.
Women are not sleeping because of your pension plan
Although the respondents know exactly what type of care they want, only a few have discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of those surveyed nationwide said that they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed the matter with their children.
Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance company Nationwide, said: "People want to be cared for by their families, but they don't take the initiative to discuss it".
We should start with envy.
Communicate with your spouse and children: You cannot expect your family to care for you if you do not tell them in advance what you want to happen.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and how you will be cared for, since those decisions will affect the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor may be able to help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
The way you choose to pay for long-term care may include taking a standard long-term care insurance policy, combining the insurance policy with the money you have invested to cover those costs, or investing your wealth  as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Settle past legal disputes.
Have a document giving instructions from health care providers and give it to a trusted person who will see that you are given medical care and medical attention in a manner that is in harmony with your wishes, in a situation where you cannot speak.
Also, get a lawyer to file your financials.
You can appoint someone you trust to make financial decisions and to make sure that you pay your bills if you are no longer able to do anything for yourself.
Keep in mind a few facts: Suppose your aging parent has an emergency and is admitted to the hospital.
Can you tell us what medications you use and what side effects you have?
Write down those points so that they can be found nearby.
Martin:  Apart from the financial issues, what will the doctors be?
What is Meriana?

A man shot several times in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times while walking home at night.
This man in his 40's was in the area of Ilfracombe, in Oxford Grove, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Officials say the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, is simply a continuation of the crime.
The victim did not see the shooter.
There were serious accidents and the police called for people to give a witness.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials say at least 384 people died when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number is expected to rise over time.
With no communication system, emergency officials are unable to determine the situation in Donggala, which is north of Palu and near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some interesting facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of the peninsula on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, and had a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
The canyon runs along the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi and covers more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The area, which is the administrative center of the sub-province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the backbone of the economy in Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Donngala.
Nickel mining is another important activity in the province, but it is especially prevalent in Morowali, across the coast from Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Society, Palu and Donngala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits in a seismically active region and earthquakes occur regularly there.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in the area in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake struck the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 and triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several earthquakes occur on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake strikes southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, causes a 10-meter tsunami that devastates several villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing devastation and terror as people remember the losses caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred this time, but the collapse of buildings killed over 100 people.
2018: An earthquake struck the popular Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of tourists in temporary distress.
Sarah Palin's eldest son Faces Family Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska mayor and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of abuse.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest, according to a report given Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, he took the phone from a woman who knew him when she tried to call the police to report criminal activity.
KTUU reports that Palin is still in custody at Mat-Su Prison and is due to pay a $500 bail.
He reportedly appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was innocent when asked whether he was guilty or not.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor charges, which means she could be sentenced to a summer in prison and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum sentence of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, she was charged with assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the incident.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans' Council.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a violent incident, and carrying a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend reports that he hit him in the face with a fist.
Military veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD associated with serving in the military in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications equipment were damaged and the death toll is expected to rise over time.
The earthquake struck near the city of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
People are posting videos on social media showing this happening.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami came and swept the coast.
Federal prosecutors file a special motion for the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York terror attack, in which eight people died, be sentenced to death  the most unusual sentence ever handed down since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly hired a truck to attack people on the West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan, harassing cyclists and pedestrians in Oct.
To pass the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed those eight people Deliberately and that he maimed people Deliberately, according to a press release issued at the Southern District of New York's death sentence application.
Both charges could carry the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury handed down 22 charges against Saipov, including eight counts of murder related to fraud, a charge that often leads to organized crime, and a charge of violence and car vandalism.
Describing the way Saipov carried out the "cruel, cruel, and shocking act", the prosecutors said that the attack required him to sit down and think it over.
The petition announcement said: "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has been crippled, has caused pain to family and friends and even caused them to lose Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of those who died were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years had passed since this Southern State of New York had had a trial leading to the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was handed down in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Court documents said that Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any emotion for days or months after the attack.
One policeman said that he told investigators that he felt happy.
Saipov told the authorities that he was motivated to do so after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment documents.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hoisted in the hospital room where he was, the officer said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the lawyers representing Saipov, said that he was deeply disappointed by the decision of the federal prosecutor.
Patton says: I think the decision to request the death sentence rather than accepting the accused's plea and being sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole only prolongs the time that everyone will spend in suffering.
Saipov's legal team had petitioned the prosecutor not to seek the death sentence.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to raise public protest today at a rally held during the Tory caucus.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should be as sensitive to the opposition's power given to the EU as one of Theresa May's MPs said she should be conducting EU talks.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have left long ago if Mr Farage had been the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces is to unite the opposing parties in her party, which is exacerbated by anti-Brexit supporters holding different anti-Brexit marches.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to maintain his policy of flexibility with Chequers due to attacks from Brexit supporters, anti-Brexit and EU.
His colleagues are calling for him to continue negotiating with Brussels despite opposition - and forcing the opposition to EU membership and the Labour party to choose between a deal with him or a riot.
Speaking at a parade held in Solihull called From To Tell, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "disband the Chequers".
He said that Mr. Farage should also be placed in the same position and given the responsibility to attend the talks on Brussels.
He said that if the driver had been the one, we would have been gone long ago.
Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit but we should dissolve the Chequers.
Speaking of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight in the world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: The idea that British people have changed their opinion and want to be more democratic is not true.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the rally, and told reporters: All I want to say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people don't like the Chequers, the Opposition won't vote for it, the members of our party don't like it and the freedom fighters who made us elected.
Please leave the Chequers matter and listen.
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "The Prime Minister will continue as prime minister as long as he fulfills his promises".
Mr Farage told the demonstrators, politicians should be fired if they do not want to compromise the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
He said, "The issue at hand is the issue of trust between us  the people  and our political leaders.
They have already refused to go back on Brexit and today we tell them that we will not allow them to do that.
In a message to the crowded crowd, he said: I want our political leaders, who are on the verge of Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are gathering the people's army in this country that has given us the victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we are an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city's square.
Freedom fighters were pulling anti-Brexit votes after the group was formed this weekend.
A Labour party member, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservative party for the security problems of the app it uses.
He added: I see people who say they can do IT software and all the other technological stuff for Canada and that and that, they make business connections work everywhere without borders in Ireland.
He added: It's just a matter of opinion.
The Brexit is not a good thing.
Warren prepares to consider running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will scrutinize the presidential issue after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in the November presidential election against Geoff Diehl of the GOP, who chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
Recently there have been rumors that he may face a major challenge against Trump in 2020.
The meeting held Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th in the district since Trump took office.
One of the audience asked him if he would run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that included a woman at the top.
Suspect arrested for shooting Sims of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at an ET news conference that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m.
They released a video showing the shooter on Friday, asking for help to find the shooter.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247 sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday: "Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result".
Wayde was helping his friend when he was about to be shot.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was there, with a gun in his hand, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not fight when he was arrested and was imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, stands 6 feet 9 inches (1.98 m), and had played in 32 games last season averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to winning the world title after team instructions lead him to defeat Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear from Valtteri Bottas' finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in this race.
From the very beginning, Bottas set himself up and left Hamilton stunned as he defended his scoring in the first two corners and made Vettel compete with the players in his team.
Vettel overshot and left Hamilton behind in traffic, which must have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after the cooking and hesitantly the Ferrari driver opened the way for him, thinking he would lock him in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and finished seventh at the end of the first leg on his 21st birthday.
He then positioned himself ahead of the main stage of the race with a view to finishing early and overtook Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally stopped on the 44th stage but was unable to increase speed on the remaining eight stages as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day, since Valtteri had done a good job all weekend and had shown himself to be a real man.
The team did a great job taking first and second places, said Hamilton.
That Was a Bad Sign
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a hearing on Saturday for insisting that she did not release a confidential letter that Christine Blasey Ford wrote to the Supreme Court accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a hearing in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that the events in the Senate show that people are "bad, cruel, and untrustworthy".
"The only good thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is to see people angry, showing malice, cruelty and disloyalty.
When you look at the news reports, they say, "Oh, not me.
I don't know anything.
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you publish this document?
Remember his reply... did you issue this document - oh, what?
No, he did not.
I did not give out any document.
Wait a minute, slowly.
Did we get the document out...No, we didn't get it out" he added in the deep voice of a member of the Senate.
Feinstein was sent a letter in July explaining the charges Ford is accusing Kavanaugh of, and the details of the letter came out in early September  but Feinstein denied that his office had issued it.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I give his details, to that Feinstein on the committee, reports The Hill.
He had asked me to keep the matter a secret and I kept it a secret as he had asked.
But his explanation apparently caught the president, who said of the matter during a hearing on Saturday: "You know what, that was a bad sign.
He may not have done so, but that was a sign of a terrible situation.
In his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said that the Democrats were using the charges to achieve their own ends.
They want to regain power by any means they can.
You can see clearly that they are cruel and cruel because they don't care who they hurt or trample as long as they get power and rule, Mediaite says these are the words of the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars wiped away the tears by losing to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by returning the baton to the tree on Saturday at home to Dundee with a 5-3 defeat.
The Giants positioned themselves first with two points from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie weighed in before Dwyer made the Giants re-arm themselves.
Francois Bouchard re-measured Dundee's points before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored the two points that gave them the victory.
It was the third time Adam Keefe's team had been defeated in the Elite League, which on Friday played in Belfast and defeated Dundee 2-1, although it had been drawn first.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams had met, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the opening goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford scored with Beauvillier four minutes later.
The game began with a shootout, with Sullivan scoring at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt handed Cownie the score at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead in the first half of the game when he scored a second point late in the night's break.
Dundee re-arranged and Bouchard scored on a power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran met to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time towards the end of the game and ensured his team stayed ahead until the tide turned.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Save Hundreds to Escape Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero in order to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Another earthquake followed and many people were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his desk in the shaking tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, in Palu.
He remained there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was preparing to take off at that time, departed safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Australian ABC News reports that Indonesian Air Traffic Controller Yohannes Sirait says that decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We called a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
But sadly he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
He added, "Our hearts are saddened by this.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country's aid agency says it is difficult to reach the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number is increasing as many bodies are still under rubble and we have not been able to extract them", said the spokesman for the organization, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves six meters high destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft bring relief.
Risa Kusama, 35, told Sky News: "Once in a while the ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, executive director of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors but we don't know what we will find when we get there.
The situation is already bad, but it could get worse.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: I ask you to work day and night to do everything necessary to evacuate people from this area.
Are you ready to go for it? CNN reports.
Earlier this summer, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after the plane crashed into the water
The pilots of the plane that crashed in the Pacific ocean, in Micronesia, now say one person is missing, while earlier they said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement issued by Air Niugini on Saturday afternoon, it said it did not know where one male passenger was.
The flight crew says they are working with authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The flight crew was reluctant to provide information about the passenger, such as his age or race.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew when the plane crashed while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, seven people were taken to hospital, authorities said.
The flight crew said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is not known what caused the crash and what happened before.
Air traffic controllers and the U.S. Navy say the plane is in the waters near the airfield.
Some witnesses suspect that the plane accidentally passed the airport.
American pilot Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed very low.
Jaynes: "That was a wonderful story.
Jaynes says that she and others were able to navigate the waist-deep water through the life-saving doors of the sinking plane.
He says that the flight crew were terrified and even said that he had suffered a few head injuries.
The U.S. Navy says that sailors who were working nearby to improve the harbor also helped by using a pump-powered boat to get people ashore before the plane sank in water some 100 feet [30 m] deep.
Data provided by the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in the past two decades in registered PNG airline accidents, but none of those accidents are related to Air Niugini.
A researcher says a woman was burned alive at night
The court rested on Saturday in the case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Investigator at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, spent hours testifying as an expert in investigating criminal acts.
He showed the court how he used cellphone records to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night of their murder.
The Clarion Ledger reports that Rowlett said she had obtained evidence from several cell phones showing the occasions when Tellis went with Chambers on the night of her murder, contradicting her earlier claims.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was in Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford gave a witness on Saturday and said that he was absent that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was not telling the truth, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another fact about which Tellis was not truthful was that he had known Chambers for about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show you only knew him for a week
Rowlett says that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls, and personal information from her phone.
Hale says: She wiped him out of her life.
His lawyers are expected to step down on Sunday.
The judge says he expects the case to be heard by the court later that day.
The High Breed: What does hip hop teach about social problems?
Three hip hop artists seek to change the bad name that hip hop has made for itself by composing songs with helpful messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, say hip hop has moved away from its original message of political issues and solving social problems.
It seeks to return to the roots of this music and to make hip hop that teaches about social problems popular again.
Bands such as the Fugees and Common are also popular in the UK because of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nanny sues a couple after they write discriminatory messages
A New York nanny accuses a couple of evicting her because of discrimination after she received a text message from a mother complaining that she is a black person.
The couple deny that they are prejudiced, comparing the charge to a "Purple".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment at Giselle Maurice, her nanny who arrived in 2016, and realized she was black.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband, "SooooooooooooooooWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing that she had lost it, Plasco-Flaxman ya now free fired Ms. Maurice on the grounds that the traveling nanny had mocked them and was a black person, and was now looking for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was given a day off and then taken home by Uber.
Maurice now accuses the couple of having evicted him and demands $350 a day for the six months he was originally hired to work and live there, even though they did not sign the agreement.
He told the Post Friday, "I want to show them that they shouldn't do such a thing" and added that "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the accusations of prejudice, saying that it was reasonable to expel Maurice, since they had lost confidence in him after they had hurt him.
My wife sent him the text by mistake.
He is not partial.
"We are prejudiced", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
 Would you leave your children with the person you insulted, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Please be honest.
Plasco compared the charge to a "spoof", and said that his wife had only been pregnant for two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
Will you fight against such a man?
This is not the right thing to do, the banker added.
Although the case is still before the court, many people criticize the couple on social media, disagreeing with their conduct and thinking.
A new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers fear that readers will not understand the talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It is difficult to imagine myself in the mind of someone who will read it for the first time before the book is published.
That is surprising, since we now know how successful Paddington was.
He says that his father, who was a BBC videographer before he was moved to write a children's book featuring a little teddy bear, would have been optimistic about his work when it was criticized, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "a happy and sad story" after his father died last year.
Referring to Paddington, whom he describes as "a very important member of our family", he adds that his father was proud of his accomplishments.
He was a quiet man and did not like to talk about himself.
But since Paddington was real to him, it was as if you had a child who had accomplished something: you were happy with his success even though you had not worked hard.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Though it was his writing and invention, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
On arrival she found her daughter rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors were working hard to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse says: "Nad kept calling me, telling me that it was bad and that the doctors did not think that my daughter would live.
Then I received a call from Nad telling me that her daughter was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did just that.
I said, Tashi, I love you very much.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him to help his heart beat were leaking out of his body.
He was not dead but had just come out of the body.
I had to wait there, knowing that it was over.
I could not cry or weep because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to hold back.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers  unaware of her plight.
"No one knew", he says.
I bowed my head, and my tears poured out.
It is hard to describe, but it was on the plane that I felt the compassion I cannot express for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved a girl.
Two bereaved women post cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have long placed cards with encouraging messages and telephone numbers on the Welsh bridge for people to call in case of need.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
She says: I don't want any parent to feel the way I do every day.
Ms. Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that her son was a good cook and had a smile that appealed to others.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile brought light to the house.
But she quit her job shortly before committing suicide, being very depressed.
In 2014, Tyler committed suicide and was found by his 11-year-old brother.
"I always worry that this will hurt her too", says Ms. Davis.
Ms. Davis made cards, telling people that there are people they can go to or talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not get carried away with the matter  you should talk.
Ms. Humpherys, who had been a longtime companion of Ms. Davis, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, shortly after Mark's mother died.
She says: She did not talk about being depressed or depressed.
"A few days before Christmas, we realized that he was not the man we knew.
She was very depressed at Christmas  when the children opened their presents she could not look them in the eye or do anything.
She says that her death has been a great loss, but they have to deal with the situation: It has caused a huge gap in the family.
It has broken our spirit.
But we all have to fight and move on.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could get something that would lead to what he was asking for, a time-limited and limited investigation, we might be able to bring some consensus", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the review committee would be disrupted by the political parties' dispute.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They are held back by the passage of time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6  and if, as Republicans expect, he does not perform well, it will undermine their efforts to elect their nominee to the state's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators, recruiting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush when he was in the White House and met his wife Ashley there, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen if the FBI does not report?
Elections will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republican and 49 Democratic seats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to secure at least 50 Senate votes, which will enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to resolve the issue and get him installed in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans going to work is decreasing under Kim's rule
A South Korean lawmaker says that the number of North Koreans living in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korea branch office, said that last year 1,127 crossed the border, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
One of the factors, Mr. Park says, is the strict border rules between North Korea and China and the high price demanded by smugglers.
Pyongyang did not say a word.
Most North Koreans who move to South Korea eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally settled in South Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Many are also fleeing through China, which marks a long border with North Korea and is easier to access than the heavily fortified border between the two countries.
China considers North Korean refugees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and it forces them to return home.
North and South Korea are still at war, although the situation has improved somewhat in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for postponed talks on nuclear arms reduction.
This came after President Donald Trump held a special meeting in June with Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together to make the Korean superpower nuclear-free.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that the imposition of US sanctions is slowing progress.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr. Ri said: If we don't trust the US, we can't be sure that our country is safe and in such a situation, we can't remain unarmed.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "emotional", and unfit to be on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is "emotional", and is not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
Referring to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Pelosi said: "I believe that if she was a woman who did that, it would have been called emotional.
Kavanaugh raised eyebrows when he denied having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford during her teenage years.
Kavanaugh's emotions rose as he discussed his subject and sometimes even sounded like he was yelling and gasping for breath when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also criticized the Democrats before the committee, saying the charges against him are just a smear campaign by people who are heartbroken that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony showed that she could not serve in the Supreme Court, because she had shown a bias against Democrats.
He said, I think he was the one who defended himself by saying those words and by the way he mocked the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi was stunned when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh if convicted and if the Democrats would win the House of Representatives vote.
"I would say if he's lying to Congress or the FBI, he's now unfit to be on the Supreme Court, even the one he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh might decide against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is perceived to be a judge against the amendments.
At the pre-election meeting, Kavanaugh was asked whether he would reverse some of the decisions made by the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to take a depressed person to court and expect us to say, 'Good news, good news,'" said Pelosi.
Wives Should Exhibit It.
It is righteous indignation, months and years of wrath, and he cannot speak of it without weeping.
Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later: We cry when we are angry.
I guess that's what most of us do, isn't it?
He added, I was helped a lot by a woman who was an officer in another place, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she said that she made up the plan that she was not angry and started crying, saying to the person talking to her, You might think that I was hurt because I was crying.
I am furious.
Then he continued to speak.
I thought that was a wonderful thing.
It is normal to express anger by crying because people often do not fully understand the matter.
One of the scars I remember when I started working in an office that was crowded with men, was when one day I found myself crying from rage, when an older woman  who was a tough-faced boss that I was afraid of  pulled me with a scarf around my neck to take me to the corner of the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", he said.
They do not know that you are angry.
They think you're hurt and will be glad to have you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found to be in a bad mood on the Monkey Business and decided to stop running, Ms. Schroede was very upset, but decided that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
He told me 30 years later, That was not a wise decision.
Seven other candidates were already in place, and they did not need to be added.
One person called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had been in the works for some time and he was behind in raising funds, he vowed not to run unless he had raised two million dollars.
It was uplifting.
She noticed that some of her supporters gave $1,000 to men, while she received only $250.
I wondered, Do they think I get things at a discount?
When he made his speech publicly announcing that he would not run, he was so moved that he shook his head  when he thanked his supporters, expressed his frustration with the system that makes fundraising difficult and makes it harder for voters than for candidates, and about discrimination against women.
Speaking of the way she was treated by the media, Ms. Schroeder says: "It was like I was going crazy.
You might think that Kleenex is my financial backer.
I said, What shall they write upon my grave-stone?
Did she cry?
How the US-China trade war may benefit Beijing
Experts say that the sound of the US-China trade war is deafening, and since the war will not end now, the tension between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this summer when he imposed tariffs on China's main products including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The tax bill hit a peak this week when new tariffs were imposed affecting goods worth $200 billion ($200 billion), in fact taxing half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing retaliated by recently raising taxes by five to 10 percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to compete with the US and the second richest country in the world will not back down.
For Washington to withdraw from the war would mean accepting China's terms, but for China to surrender to the US would also be a disappointment to Chinese president Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could benefit China by dividing the two countries from economic dependence on each other.
"The rush of decisions by either Washington or Beijing may cause those countries more serious economic problems than observers realize", says Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the New American Security Institute.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to welcome returning refugees
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who choose to return and is asking for relief to rebuild the country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
He says: "The situation is now relatively stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism".
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by logging to make life normal again.
Now conditions are favorable for refugees to volunteer to return to their homeland, where they had fled terrorism and economic hardship that made it difficult for them to provide for their families.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still need relief in that country.
Al-Moualem says that the Syrian government would appreciate help to rebuild the devastated land.
But he made it clear that they would not accept conditional or foreign aid.
Europe takes the winning trophy at the Ryder Cup, Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by 16.5 points while USA scored 10.5 points, while playing at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth time in a row that the US has been defeated on European soil and last won the Ryder Cup as Europe in 1993.
Europe took the lead when the Danish team captain, Thomas Bjorn, scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the US champion, finished the game with a hard draw after throwing his first ball into the water at par-3 on the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian turned out to be a great player, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the game was first played in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was eliminated in 5&4 by the lower-ranked European Team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, was knocked out 2 to 1 by England's Ian Poulter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia of Spain became the most decorated player in European competition with 25.5 points.
I rarely cry, but today I can't help myself.
And the summer is tough.
I thank Thomas for lifting me up and showing his trust in me.
I am so happy that I have found this cup again.
They are the winning team, and I am proud that I was able to contribute to that creation", says Garcia, who is concerned about the European creation.
He passes the baton to his teammate John Ram who beat Tiger Woods, the US golf champion, 2&1 on Sunday in a one-man match.
Rahm, 23, said: "I feel very proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I have watched his games.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and currently has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup matches.
It is an amazing record for one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major trophies and second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been struggling to get places this week except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a great game of golf at those games.
The captain of the US team, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing game of his team, I am proud of my men, they fought.
This morning we were surprised by the European team.
We have tried.
We poured Thomas a cup of tea.
He is a master captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We're going to re-elect ourselves, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move on.
I love my 12 brothers and I am proud to work with them.
We deserve to honor them.
The game has lost us.
