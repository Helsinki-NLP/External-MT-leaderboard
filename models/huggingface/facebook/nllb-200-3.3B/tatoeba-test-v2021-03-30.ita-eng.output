I don't drink alcohol, you know.
There seems to be no way out.
We fell asleep on it.
I was very annoyed by him.
Why should we help you?
I've put the plan into action.
He made a list.
For a while, I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom is going around.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did you tell Tom why you want to go to Boston?
Tom and Mary have gone now.

I just need to rest a little.

I am totally satisfied with my new home.
Why do you study English every day?
I'd like to cross the United States of America in a convertible.
You won't find them there.
Your explanation is too abstract for me.
These monks live inside the monastery.
I just have to find him.
Can I see this?
He is able to speak Japanese.
I could be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you were joking?
Keep watching.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
I wanted to go back to his village.
Tom is satisfied with his success.
You are reliable.
I didn't even consider it.

You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with you 100%.
These flowers are not only beautiful, but they also have a good smell.
He's at the university now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes teaching French.
He took a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go and tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you would mistake him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
As I remember, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's highly unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
She's depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you the husband of Mary?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why can't you do that?

Let him stay at home if he wants!
I've lived here for ten years.
I'd be happy to give you a ride.
He tried to get up early.
I like the blue.
They have many different fish to try.
What is the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me later?
I'd like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do that for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are more powerful than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea set.
We're all going to die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his mind!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?
Poor people are people with feelings too.
I'm sure Tom is just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot all about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messed up.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.

Maybe you should listen.
He is a brilliant artist.
Let's move it along, boys.
I like your painting.
I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like your hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I'm studying at the University of Hyogo.
We're going to the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life was going on without a problem.
No one wants to help us.
They speak very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there a lot of sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
It's from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.

I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this fun, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20th.
It's a good shot.
I'll leave you alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a policeman.
Does Tom work here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
She is dishonest.
I read books often.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got annoyed.
I'm already old.
I have a criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought an English book in a bookstore.
Tomorrow I'm going to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see it.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Get out of here, all of you.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.

From bad to worse!

We can't leave you there.
Tom played soccer.
Stop that stuttering.
I know you.
We are the real heroes.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday comes only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I took that as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her !
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
Do you want to eat with us?
You don't seem too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is treacherous, isn't he?
Is this cage supposed to protect you from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I used to play the trombone when I was younger.
I am faithful.
Can you write in braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why are you trying to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I assume they speak French.
Step forward, please.
You need to get more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
It's smoking up.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
She's smarter than him.
What will you do this summer?
He became irritated.
Do you speak Shanghai?
It's shrunk because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
I'm in London, is that it?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money on him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
Who's your favorite female rapper?
Give Tom my regards.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving so soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas. I'm not sure.
I'll tell them that's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass the ketchup, please.
I happened to sit next to her at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who is the man playing the piano?
I'd decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income on drinking.
You have to Google it harder!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does that look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We've landed on a deserted island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When is your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good at it.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He promised to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son by myself.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who tipped them off?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give you 50 grand for this statue.
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
You should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a warm summer evening.
I always walk.
She's determined
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the car keys.
I really don't feel like talking.
So he must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken up.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of the American way of cooking.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It'll clear up this afternoon.
He went blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many continents are there in the world?
He's a good singer, is he?
Tom is angry with Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.

I was just scared.
Tomorrow is a party.
I drank too much beer yesterday.

I'm still in the middle of something.
I appreciate your insights.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom likes fly-fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We have to inform Tom.
Tom is still sleeping.
Tom is a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you say.
Could you ask Tom to stop by after work?
He plays the drum.
It must be warm.
Which online dictionary do you use the most?
Light the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are some of the best.
Call them.
That's cool.

She plowed the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are quite busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.

It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me that he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most common fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
How come you don't have anything to say?
Scandalously !
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Watch your tongue.
I drank the wine.
He is more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later on.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose whatever you want.
I'm at the hospital, I got struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
He turned the radio off.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
It's in the van.
I'm not introducing them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe this?
I waited for a bus to arrive.
I found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't well.
You students are expected to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
This is an outrageous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
A lot of people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my child.
I'm not a very good driver.
I heard Tom is learning to drive.
She knows I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I cut the branch with an axe.
Mini-skirts are back in style.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least at six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.

Are you Mary?
After dinner, I'll walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
She's two years older than him.

Judy is a very bright student.
We knew the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a police officer.

Why don't I just buy her a hat?
I thought Tom would show up.
She's pale for the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening to me, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom is my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.

It was a difficult beginning for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why does this always happen to me?
The birds are pecking at the ground.
The park is closed on Mondays.
You didn't even update the firmware?
I have a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do this now?

I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We are Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.

That's what I'm looking for.
He's been practicing.
You guys coming in?
Which way should I start?

This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry for you.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you said to Tom?
Do you remember her license plate number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
Let's listen to some music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take it to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
It doesn't matter to Tom either.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He has quite a few friends in America.
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
Are you reading this book tonight?

Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you do the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
She turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door close.
She got him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
Reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You are stubborn.
I'm not feeling nervous.
You have a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What do you guys plan to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with his leap reached the still Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My dad's always meddling in my personal life.
Everyone wants something different.
Tom refused to carry out the order.
I know you don't like them.

Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.

Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting weird.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You are random.
Please turn down the music.
I trained Tom for the job.
She watched him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.

Sami isn't here to ruin your day.
I took off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman is drinking water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are picky about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is cheap, it will soon close its doors if the food does not taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free this evening.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
You interested in that?
Tom cut his wrists.
You look relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it at a thrift store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why doesn't he work with me anymore?
It doesn't mean anything.
You're lying to me.
She helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates the clubs.
Go home now.

I will never forget that night.
Be cheerful, add an exclamation point to all your sentences.
Can you see anything in there?
You're ready.

I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom that I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.

I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock broke.
I'm not waiting forever.
Just give the order.

What are you indicating?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She's the one who stitched the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying at home is no fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.

Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You are very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You are a brave man.
You're not surprised?
It only costs a penny.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a minute.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture on.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June's not that far away, either.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He threw me out of the house.
My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you going to leave me?
Tom has always liked you.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, OK?
You wanted to ask me some questions?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took a chance.

There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom called 911.
We are brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?

Tom stayed behind.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.

Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.

I'm not anyone's enemy.
I forgot his number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be honest?
What are you going to do?
Tom looks tired. Please take him home.
May all your wishes come true!
He already did.
He's an expert with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, don't they?
Let's talk about it.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.

It's a disease to be obsessed with winning, it's a disease to be obsessed with using martial arts, and it's a disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you've learned. It's a disease to be obsessed with attacking, and it's also a disease to be obsessed with defending. It's also a disease to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. To fix your mind obsessively on anything is considered a disease.
