Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already common in scientific circles, but it also provides information that fossils generally can't, things like color and 3D layout.
Scientists say that the animal's ornamental feathers were brown oak-brown on top and carotenoid on the bottom.
This finding also adds to our understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the feathers of this dinosaur did not have a well-developed rod, called a stalk, but had the other features of feathers - beards and fine hair - the researchers argue that the evolutionary progress of the stalk was probably slower than that of the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather to regulate temperature or display. The researchers believe that even if this is a young dinosaur's tail, it is still a representation of an adult animal's feathers rather than a chick's cocoon.
The researchers noted that even if this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, it's still a full-grown animal, not a chicken's crook.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way.
The effect that this team was looking for would be caused by the intergalactic ripple forces between the galactic dark matter and the galactic dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational force on Earth, causing ripples, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Milky Way.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in the form of a halo around a galaxy and is made up of large amounts of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been done with primitive technology: Voters were placed in individual ballot boxes and pre-printed paper ballots representing their chosen candidate were placed in envelopes.
After the authorities confirm the identity of the voter, the voter places the ballot paper in the ballot box and signs his or her name on the voting list.
The French electoral law has relatively strict rules for these procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that at the beginning of the voting there is no envelope in them and no envelope is added to them except the envelope of the authorized voter.
Candidates can send delegates to observe every part of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers, following special procedures, and under strict supervision.

Deputy Inspector General Dr. K. Arya said: "We arrested five men who had raped a Swiss woman and confiscated her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chief of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
While emergency services were busy freeing the driver from the red TT, the road at the scene of the accident was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to the James Page Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Adkoya has since been charged with the murder of her son in the Edinburgh Magistrates' Court.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness may be affected because his image has been widely circulated.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish courts have a different approach, and have found the publication of the photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "Journalists seem to be taking a risk by publishing photos and so on of suspects".
The Scottish court, which is in charge of the whole case, told reporters that no further explanation will be given, at least until the indictment.
The document is based on this information leak and relates to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demanded a border demarcation in accordance with the conditions before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other reported topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, as well as the issue of Jordan Valley.
Israel has called for a permanent military presence in the Valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the parliament has agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The hunters participating in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the trial was supervised and the effectiveness was assessed.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Riflemen's Association of Australia (NSW), eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Riflemen's Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director of park and heritage conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at the new nine-member CEC.
This is the fifth Martelli CEP in the last four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasional violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections due in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 extreme warming events, which the company called "minor".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (9:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of any damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has kidnapped a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and taken Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead.
The hostages, including children and six elderly people, as well as Filipino migrants, were released early.
The photographers then took the picture of an elderly woman who needed to take a bath.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began her career at the Auckland National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began her research on preterm birth in her spare time.
He showed that if the hormone is given, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
China Daily reported that government investigators recovered two flight records from the black box on Wednesday.
Fellow shipwrights also paid tribute to Luna.
Tammy Dreamer said, "Lona was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night when she was two months old. She was very beautiful and unique. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldstein Ronson said: "Luna was as temperamental as I was... perhaps more so than I was... I loved her but I left her... I hope she is in a better situation".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister of the interim government, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic after the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaint, there has been some doubt about her fitness at these events.
He has not been able to get the medication he needs to overcome his pain because it is banned.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are likely to be the source of water and organic material for Earth, which could be the building blocks of proteins and life.
Scientists hope to learn how planets form, especially how Earth formed after a comet collision in ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and passed a bill to legalize gay marriage later this month.
He called these rumors "foolishness and political libel".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) claims that the NextGen system will enable aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology versus ground-based radar-based technology that allows air traffic controllers to track the aircraft with more accuracy and gives pilots more precise information.
No additional vehicles are allowed, and there will be no shuttle service to Wembley, and no parking or ride facilities for the playground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that they might have to play the game behind closed doors and without team sponsors.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that because of interbreeding between a native Darwin's triangle, the mid-earth triangle, and the migratory cactus triangle, the Great Cactus triangle, the process took much longer.
Gold can be shaped into a variety of shapes. It can be made into very small rings.
It can be drawn on thin wire that can be twisted and woven together. It can be hammered or rolled in a plate.
It can be thinned and embedded in another metal, and it can be thinned so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "The Alchemist".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Closed water changes the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms are made up of only one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then squeeze them with dry, clean hands until they are balls.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels interesting and forms a kind of shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro has a flush-tank toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remains of the sewerage system have been found in houses in the cities of Minos and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Iran, and China, toilets were also found. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women attended in groups and mixed.
When you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite picks up the call in space and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a large rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has created an incredible transformation in the world. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is make transportation easier and faster.
The wheel has given us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
This group is underneath the more medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to mountain goats to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lazy domestic cats) that eat large numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the kinam, the specific thing that each kitten does to keep it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the felines, and they live in large groups called herds.
The offspring consist of one to three related males with thirty females and young.
Women are usually closely related and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions act very much like wolves or dogs, animals that behave remarkably like lions (but not other big cats), and are very deadly to their prey.
Like a six-legged athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, run long distances, and pull something five times as strong as a human.
It is also grouped with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar (genus Panthera). These four species are the only felines that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not the full roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of roaring words.
Leopards love to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that a leopard hunts are much smaller than its body.
Scientists believe that the American road tiger tracks animals by smell, finds food, and tracks footprints on the ground by scent.
They can see well in the dark because of their night vision, and they can also move very quietly. To hunt prey, the ocelot first hides itself in the surrounding environment and then suddenly dives on top of its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small community) separates from the main community to which it belongs (such as when they move to that mountain range or river, or when they move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different capabilities or adaptations than what they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need to adapt to the environment.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new environment, they become less and less like other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can't be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit.
Plants photosynthesize their food from the sun. They also provide shade
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the preeminent hunter of his era, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth in the roof of its mouth, meant there was no escape for anything that came its way.
We're not sure, but it may have had a dual language, feeding on turtles, large fish, and other mammals, and may have even been a homophobe.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrant would not make a difference.
While most of their cuisine will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of exotic and unusual items, including wild falcons, peacocks, snails, and a species of reptile called the hibernating mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on their chairs and ate their meals, the rich men liked to have banquets together and enjoy their meals together.
Ancient Roman cuisine cannot have included the foods that were brought in later centuries from the Americas and Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built an initial temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People had to make sacrifices to the gods, and the priests had to try to meet the needs of the gods during ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary behind it, which only the clergy could enter.
Pyramid towers sometimes had a special shape, called a ziggurat, as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was God's own sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter.
This Jewish family spent most of its life outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were play-banks looking out onto the street; the stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was gradually settled. In the Norse epic, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But apart from his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, nothing is right. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" appear in reverse.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that this large calligraphic document was hung for safekeeping early in its life, measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches.
So, it's possible that the note was merely attached as a label.
The landings of the first day of the invasion and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was under the French rule of the Hussites. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940, and instead of fighting the invaders, they collaborated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an attack that became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French forces were free, they had liberated the south of France and had changed their course towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture maintained by a very large group of people, a community, who live and work together.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city, and to some extent also defines the size of society.
Civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge across generations, a long cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and cannot be recognized as civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government under the principles of confederation - of which Congress was the sole author.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, because there was no national legislature or judiciary, and relied on government officials, who often did not cooperate, to carry out all its functions.
Nor was there any reference to the abolition of taxation and customs laws between countries.
Amendments to these clauses were necessary to obtain the unanimous consent of all states, and states also needed to obtain the positive opinion of their central government even in the absence of a representative.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful football team in the world, after Germany, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Common sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "island nation" in terms of its geographical location.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors called the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a revolution in native grain production operations and employing Chinese laborers to work on its sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of the western and northern areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the Qing government was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), it signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which held the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt, and the repair continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, it's got its image ratios from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, and the 36mm width is 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (which we divide by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is equal to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family formats) have this aspect ratio or very close to it.
The very annoying and ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamics while maintaining order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three vertical and horizontal images (see for example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being monitored.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
It affected everyone from the lowest to the lowest.
One of the core beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that's exactly why the church's treasury was created.
The central power of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has served its purpose.
Immediately after the hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated all international laws that had been accepted by several international agreements over the past two centuries, it proved to be an effective strategy to cut off vital military and civilian resources.
The UK has mined international waters and even threatened neutral shipping to prevent any vessel from entering entire parts of the ocean.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unconditional submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude in most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, the nations resolved to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to New York City in the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with four pennies to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Beechler (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each time period of China or each family in power had a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era between each dynasty, with provinces being divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people died to gain the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, including the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, careers were open to all male applicants, allowing for more ambitious and successful people to succeed.
The same was true for the military, because instead of ranking the army based on rank, it was now based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to go to a cave called Hara in the mountain Nur for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived for centuries, reflects a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knows that there is such a thing, it's not easy to find.
Nothing is seen but the beautiful clear sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only surviving wonder of the seven wonders still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of several great pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Pyramid Complex in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid) and several small tombs, temples, and statues of the Great Abul-Eser in the valley.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
An upward-scoring symbol is like a V and a downward-scoring symbol is like a pendulum or a square without an end.
That means you start at the top and pull the armpits, and at the bottom, you start at the heel, which is where you grab the armpits by hand, and you pull the armpits forward.
Usually, pulling the arch toward the violin's handle produces a softer sound, while the back movement is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to draw your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the Archeological markings have musical aspects, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified Queen, Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two minor children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowds of the king and queen forced the windows of their carriages to be left wide open.
One of the crowd is said to have shaken the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles to the terrified queen.
The cost of the US imperialist war in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay their taxes to the American colonial regime to pay off the bulk of the cost and interest of the Philippine government's floating bonds through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people are the main achievements of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the templates, you have to understand the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which these events occurred is generally called the Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Middle Ages, and after that was the Late Middle Ages, ending by the Convention of about 1500.
Technological algebra is a term that actually covers a range of ideas, from the pressure of technology or technological necessity to the precise meaning of the word, to the fact that the fundamental rationale of the laws of science and their emergence in technology governs human destiny.
Most interpretations of technological algebra share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself pursues a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has more impact on native societies than on conditioned societies.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily caused the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network was not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The shared ownership of cars also leads to high accident rates on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new methods in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a huge element of cultural algebra, coming from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and over time, the customs and culture of that geography evolved, and these were in harmony with the position of society, which was better than the rules that were arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the contemporary world fashion capital, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of nobility began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its position was weakened as the Crusaders exported their gifts of silk and spices, which were worth more than the supply of the Eastern Roman market.
It was at this time that the transfer of the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first the dress was mainly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the styles in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop fashion. One of the biggest changes was the result of the Crusades, and people started using buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done in order to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the bio-region, along with rotation farming or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers made a living through agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Micro-cultures bring together like-minded people who feel that they are being ignored by society's norms, and they give them the development of a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, place of residence and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographical or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, environment, and deliberate idiom.
One of the most common ways that we talk about the importance of sociability is by taking help from the plight of children who didn't learn about sociability from adults during their development due to neglect, abuse, or intentional exposure.
Some of these children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect is due to the parents' denial of the child's severe mental and physical disability.
Abused children may have experienced severe abuse or emotional trauma before the child left or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children display behaviors (in physical terms) that are almost animal-like, such as fear and indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more fun, scavenging goes one step further.
Scalping is not a method of learning but rather an aid that supports people who are receiving a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scalars can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scalar, but the little paper clip in Microsoft Office is a scalar.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software, and the goal is to ask, provoke, and explain ways that students might be challenged to do it on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that lacks nourishment, care and discipline, but it does happen.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our care system strives to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, sustainable education and reliable health care.
Adoption requires that all the needs of the adopted child are met in the previous home from which they were adopted.
The Internet combines elements of collective and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usability and convenience.
For example, "learning" and "sociability" are cited as the main motivation for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience response to websites.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the field of microinterpretation of speech and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting small sentences, one can detect that a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Cry", showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess the sincerity of intentions.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be common in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two sources of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and selection out of the store of expressed variation.
The disconnect and recombination of the difference between the two pools pushes each generation back and forth.
Outside of the savannah, meeting the amino acid-based needs of plant sources was difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system.
And the consequences of not doing so are serious: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant source of protein is in leaves and pulses, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest, unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (wheat, chicken, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep disorder is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and then falling back to sleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a specific diuretic) before bedtime that will force the person to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calmness is inversely related to the degree of stress in the body and the mind.
The less tension, the more positive the gift of life force. Everyone has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahāyāna love path and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it incorporates the Kandanalini, yoga, meditation and the path of love.
Using Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga movements, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Through the embodiment of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the Soviet-American alliance. With the end of the war, the differences in system, process and culture led to the separation of these countries.
With the last two years of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years, fighting with proxy armies, on battlefronts from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places, in real time.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridge.
But these plans were shattered almost overnight, when more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and, after attacking eastern Poland, formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's job was to ensure that your country had the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One example worth mentioning is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans were trying to get people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was mainly using U-boats to try to stop the passage.
If Germany could defeat the Allies, maybe it could defeat Britain because it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to lion, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds on hillsides or other pasturelands and were often tended by shepherds, who were often children and adolescents similar to the usual shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
The wagon line was made in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and to haul larger loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
The railway was introduced almost as early as to hold the rails in place. However, gradually, it was realized that if there was an iron railway tie, the rails would be more efficient.
Although this became common, iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Wood wheels eventually replaced iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The first form of transportation was walking; humans started walking standing two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors were the Southern Copts, who, as usual, did not walk normally.
Particularly bipolar grey has been found in southern fossil copies from 4.2-3.9 Ma, although the Chadian coast may have been walked on two legs from as early as seven Ma.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmentally active to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is exactly like many supportive therapies, however, if we're not looking for a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and we need to deactivate it.
It's clear that the world has changed because of human advances in science and technology, and the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the strange way of life that humans live.
After it was passed by Congress on the Fourth of July, a written draft signed by John Hancock, the Speaker of Congress, and Charles Thomson, the Secretary, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were created, which is now known as Dunlap's press.
John Nixon was the one who first read the document in public on July 8 in the Independence Hall courtyard.
On the 6th of July a message was sent to George Washington, who on the 9th of July ordered it read to his troops in New York. On the 10th of August a message arrived in London.
The Danlaup 25 is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, we call them birds.
Because they have feathers and they can fly, most people don't recognize them as dinosaurs.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a terrier.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and in computer jargon these numbers are called binary digits - or bits.
Internal intoxication is not immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be immediately diagnosed.
The best cause of internal poisoning may be the presence of an empty medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the first aid instructions label for that particular toxin.
Entomologists use the term "sass" in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitism in humans.
Both killer insects and bedbugs are bed-dwellers, that is, they adapt to living in a nest or inhabiting a host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is an important neurological disorder in younger and older adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or that of their child.
These couples can arrange a family plan for their baby.
In adoption, parents terminate their parental rights to give custody to another couple.
The main goal of science is to discover how the universe works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
However, this is not the case alone, it is an experiment and an experience that is necessary to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, and also to guide scientific research.
Naturalism and philosophy focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West cut off its ties with its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many people often take the physiological and behavioral rhythms seriously, linking them to the existence of the internal cycle and their production to the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Oscillating biological clocks are self-sustaining instruments that continue a period of a free-floating cycle in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first indications of the genetic nature of DNA.
Both He and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with phosphoric rays or the protein in the phage with radiosulfur.
Mutations can have very different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells involved are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in the same microbial cells can be passed to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-friendly tourism is an attraction for people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery such as plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about the Organatoanges in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the country by car to go to their workplace and are transported by others who are going to work in the same place they came from.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a transportation system based on personal cars.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its sustainable states, the state that has fueled and supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why are transportation systems the cause of such complaints, why do we see them fail every day? Is it because of the inefficiency of the vehicle engineers, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of autonomous drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable and rational range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a rational structure, and this can be determined almost mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three characteristics are established: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) velocity.
These relationships help plan, design, and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape their predators and to find food and mating.
Most insects have the ability to flip their wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them the ability to hide from predators in a wider range of small spaces.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are snails and day-flying mosquitoes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise, that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because on Earth you don't feel like you're moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth, and it carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles in width at some points.
Twenty percent of all the water that flows from rivers on Earth to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main basin of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and the water collects thousands of small rivers.
Although the stone pyramid continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, there was never a pyramid that was greater in size and technical superiority than the Triple Pyramid.
The new kingdom of ancient Egypt marveled at the historic monuments of their predecessors, buildings that were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populous of the seven.
The Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and administrative communication.
Italian is also a common language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
From ancient times, people have known of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because all these elements can be found in their pure form in nature and are relatively simple to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that all things were made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they would change into new materials and form what we see.
Alloys are basically combinations of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in this universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the end of this sentence.
So, when the pencil came out, it became a friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil is becoming less common.
People now write their messages on a computer screen, and they never have to go near a pencil.
One can only wonder what the batting lineup will be like when nothing ever comes of it.
The fission of a nuclear bomb is based on the principle that the fusion of a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons takes energy.
It's kind of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, re-splitting the nucleus of an atom, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to collapse with no or little guidance.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and soil. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometres (45 mi) thick on the near side and 100 kilometres (62 mi) thick on the far side.
The undergrowth is thinner and the highland subsoil is thicker.
As the skin becomes thinner, it may have more sediment on the near side, and the sludge will rise and surface more easily.
Content theories are based on what there are things that people repeat or like.
These theories propose that individuals have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized during development and adulthood.
These theories are about what makes certain people want to do certain things, and what is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors emerge: one is trying to stay on top of the spectrum, and the other is trying to stay on top of the spectrum.
This type of manager is unusual in making decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything the team has done and do it himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This often creates a rift between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their physical neighborhood.
They often have more autonomy than the contractual team members because their teams can organize meetings based on different time zones, but their local management may not realize these time zones.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The management team is the intangible team, to which each member reports. This intangible team sets the specific standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to enter the process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals is to implement the concepts of organizational learning.
When all available resources are used effectively in the organizational operational units, creativity and ingenuity can happen.
As a result, the process of organizational collaboration to overcome barriers can lead to a new creative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the backbone of scientific research.
It's long been recognized that various types of brain injuries, emotional catastrophes, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our brain processes.
Although AI has strong implications for science fiction stories, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the AI industry involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer problems and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate fields that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now used most often in economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as embedded in numerous home computers and video game software programs.
Scientific travel is a major part of every classroom. Teachers often like to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides the solution by enabling virtual science trips. Students can view ancient artifacts in museums, go to an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting next to their classmates in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, which is revised every year, but old versions are kept online for use as notebooks.
Blogs can also help to improve student writing skills. Although students often start their blogging with grammar and spelling confusion, audience presence generally makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to avoid criticism in order to improve his writing.
Although blogging  forces students to be more aware of the world around them, the need to satisfy the interest of the students' audience encourages awareness and interest (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that inspires and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; and by actively responding to online content, students can express their views on the text of others' writings, as well as their views on particular topics (Orwick, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant and multilingual capital, and is home to a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and further north are the natural beauties of Muscoota and beyond.
All of these and more highlight Ontario to outsiders as something that is uniquely Canadian.
Large areas in the more northerly areas are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To give you a demographic comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans than Canadians in the United States.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and most diverse of all the continents.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it was formed on a large scale in the Comoros and Mayotte.
And European colonization began in the 15th century, when Vasco de Gama, as a Portuguese explorer, found the route from Europe to India.
In the north, the area is surrounded by the Sahara coast and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also beneficial to get a ring (not necessarily one that looks expensive.
Women need to recognize that cultural differences may lead to events that they find annoying and that are not likely to be followed up on, and shaken hands, and so on.
Be firm in discouraging men and resist without fear (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make things better!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by barbarian fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and then rebuilt it as Casablanca, leaving it only after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city of Dar el-Baiz, and Spanish merchants who established their trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the cities in Morocco with the least attractive shopping areas.
Around the Old Medina, you can find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as crochet, pottery, leather goods, alkali and a full range of carvings, but all of these are for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the volcanic eruptions of Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city streets, especially the downtown area.
Although security in Goma is responsibly enforced, any visit outside Goma should be considered in order to understand the situation of ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Mount Nyiragongo volcano, along which are the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a motor taxi to get around in Goma. The typical (local) price is around 500 CFR for a short ride.
The city of Timbuktu, which was almost too inaccessible, has led to its name being used as a metaphor for strange and inaccessible lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it is a tourist attraction and has an airport because of its old age.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert grasslands.
It was one of the main stops during the Louis Gates PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
It is clearly in contrast to other cities in the country, because it has more Arab characteristics than African characteristics.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, stretching east along the border with Mozambique and north along the border with Zimbabwe, with the southern boundary being the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different biogeographical regions, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, day-to-day maintenance and admission is charged.
A game card that allows entry to select South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks can be useful.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the mainland of Hong Kong and is a place where many tourists consider it to be their main tourist focus.
The iconic buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline are like a glittering bar chart, revealed by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon Bay.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development along the northern coastline is concentrated in the redeveloped land.
This is the place where the British colonists took it for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest contiguous belt of conifer trees in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh and India to the interior.
Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the park is called Sundarbans Forest Park.
These forests are not just the Karnataka marshes - they are some of the last remnants of the dense forests that once covered the Sindh and Ganges.
The Sundarbans area is about 3,850 square kilometers, and about a third of it is water/basin.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer have now been seen in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-regional station (River Bridge) throughout the day, but most of them depart for the east and Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-regional buses are often crowded, it is recommended to book a few days in advance.
Most areas are covered by the Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are one of the quickest and most convenient ways to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punahha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oiapoque River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
It has two towers 83 meters high, 378 meters long and two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The tower has a vertical drop of 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge's completion date is September 2017, which is the expected completion date for the customs stations.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsisting on subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Land of the Giant Indians", was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous characteristics and personalities.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best youth teams and players in the world.
The biggest race of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Square.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news of competitions and where to buy tickets for adult competitions.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley and along the FIC West store, allows money to be exchanged.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley and US dollar credit cards are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted in more remote islands, although UK and US currency is accepted; please arrange with the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere it's summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures usually reach over 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity work together to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no particular "dry" or "rain" season: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, it is still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
As per the park's instructions, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from other wildlife!
The American buffalo, the deer, the reindeer, the bear, and almost all the big animals, however tame they may seem, can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep proper distance. These are large, wild, and inherently dangerous animals, so don't go into their territory.
Additionally, note that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking Buddhist food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour is famous for having been the site of a naval raid in 1889, when seven German, American and British ships did not leave the harbour.
All but one British battleship was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the township led to the killing of the chief of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because of Auckland's location between the two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor region) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Dunport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of them have the shade of the Puu'tokawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in the Waitemata Harbour are located on the outskirts of the popular cities of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded and have nice shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and fresh. Another local beer is called Manta.
There's a lot of French wines to consume, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better served.
Drinking local tap water is perfectly safe, but if you're afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, "Fleet White" coffee is an alien idea. Black shorts are the same as "Espresso", cappuccino is served with plenty of dough (not just flour), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to coral reefs are made throughout the year, and injuries from these factors are rare in coral reefs.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the coasts and near the mouths of rivers north of 1770 from October to April. Occasionally they can be found outside these times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and shy away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat is the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the comfort of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can probably find out about other types of accommodation, such as camping, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, coordinated transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also book a time for you if you need time to think about the offer or to prepare other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should therefore be made through the travel agency and not directly through the hotel.
In some festivals, a large portion of the audience at music festivals choose to camp on site, and most audiences consider this a key part of the program.
If you want to be close to the stage, you have to get there early to get to the campaign site close to the music.
Keep in mind that although the music in the main show scenes may have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music until the end of the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location as there are relatively eerie noises for those who are most affected when crossing the ice.
A stay in St. Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows and clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests entertained and stay in the place.
Some establishments serve alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or high mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy roads and snow, friction is low, and you cannot drive naked on asphalt.
In a storm, the snow can be so heavy in a moment that it can trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or drift, or by the buildup or presence of ice on the vehicle's window.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, attracting many visitors.
The term "safari" generally refers to a journey by land to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars, and standard equipment allows for proper inspection.
Lions, elephants and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with a hunting camera.
A walking safari (also called a "hike on the leaves", "hike on the safari", or "hike") involves walking for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, hosting the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the cancellation, you may be in a terrible situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not continue until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket cost of around 7,000 yen.
Rinsing wet clothes can help dry them out. In many hotels, it is possible to borrow a car and a desk, even if it is not in the room.
If you are not able to access the car or do not want to wear socks, you can use a shower if you are able to.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (which can cause watering or, worse, burn).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, and in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're concerned about this, you should consider buying your bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter species of pests that are not familiar to them in their native regions.
Pests spoil food, cause harassment or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread their venom or cause transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with their own power are not usually described as disasters.
Shopping at duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods without paying taxes and duties in some places.
Travel restrictions for countries with heavy taxes can sometimes result in significant savings, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between the Point Marion and Fairmont areas has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo Freeway, as it passes through scattered woodland in the crater.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are more sharp gradients, narrow bands and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly less than the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than the other sections.
Surprisingly, cell phone service here is much stronger than in other places along the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German desserts are very good and in Bavaria they are varied and rich, and more like what is cooked in its southern neighbor in Austria.
Fruit desserts are common. Apple desserts are baked all year round, and in the summer, cherries and apples are used for decoration.
Many German desserts have almonds, nutmeg and other wood preserves. Popular cakes are often served with a thick cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich desserts, try something called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on where you are.
A curry is a dish that is prepared with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid available, the work can be either dry or wet.
In the central regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in savory dishes; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses the wide variety of regional cuisines across the nation, as Indonesia has a choice of 17,000 islands.
However, without further attribution, the term originally meant food and derived from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Jawi food, which is now widely available throughout the archipelago, contains a range of simple spicy dishes, the predominant flavorings of Jawi are ground almonds, pepper, sugar (especially Jawi coconut sugar) and various spices.
A backrest is sometimes used for the rider's foot, which is suspended on either side of the seat.
Although they provide greater stability for the rider, they can also raise safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and the saddle gets caught in the bridle, the horse will be dragged to the ground if it escapes. To minimize this risk, many precautions can be taken.
First, most motorcyclists wear motorcycle boots that have a heel and a heel that is flat and quite narrow.
In a later stage, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle to separate from the saddle in the event of a fall.
In Cochamó - the top mountaineering destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, there are various types of walls and granite rocks.
At the highest point, breathtaking views of the peaks can be seen. Climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes through the many trails and potential walls.
Winter sports on hills, including skiing and snowboarding, are extreme sports in which you ride on snow-covered slopes using ski poles or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity of the trip, which is popular among many skiers and is sometimes known as "skiing around", which means planning an entire vacation around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old -- the cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5,000 BC.
The sport of skiing on hills dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called skiing in remote areas, ski touring or ski walking.
This is related to but usually does not include ski touring or alpine style mountaineering, the latter being done on sloping terrain and requiring more sturdy skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail the same way you think of a hiking trail.
In good weather conditions, you can cover much more distance than on foot - but it's very rare to reach cross-country skiing at speed without carrying a heavy backpack on regular trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent states. Under normal circumstances, travel between multiple countries requires going through multiple visa application processes and passport controls.
However, the Schengen area functions as a country in this sense.
As long as you are in the area, you can generally cross the border without re-passing the passport control post.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of obsolete manufactured goods. Some tax authorities consider goods older than 100 years obsolete.
This definition has geographic variations, especially in parts like North America where the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
The rearing of northern deer is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the cultural exchange that exists around the trade is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, although not all Sami were involved in large deer breeding, they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, and used deer mostly as service animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern trade. Tourism is one of the important sources of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the word κολί is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is covered by a travel alert, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to use advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
Warnings are just a short summary of a country's political situation.
The comments expressed are often superficial, general and very simple compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for a dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage and disrupt social life or cause loss of human life.
Dry weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different types of it, which can vary depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Extreme winds, thunderstorms, excessive rainfall and fires, as well as lightning, tornadoes, waterfalls and monsoon storms are all forms and effects of extreme weather.
Extreme regional and seasonal weather phenomena include hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather conditions affecting their area as these can affect travel plans.
Anyone who intends to visit a country that is considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An internet search for the term 'hostile environment' will likely reveal the address of a local company.
A training course usually covers all the issues mentioned here in much more detail and usually includes practical experience.
A training course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing and a high volume of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines that deal with survival in the wild, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travellers who intend to change their gender abroad must have a valid document for their return journey.
Governments have a tendency to issue genderless passports or to update documents to match the name and gender of the person being sought.
Foreign governments' willingness to certify these documents varies widely.
The inspections at security checkpoints have also become much more intense in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanner before surgery, and their dignity should remain intact while maintaining their privacy.
Rip currents are the reverse flow of waves moving from the coast to the sea, often occurring at a rock or similar location.
The backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections due to the underwater topology, and a rapid flow towards the water depths may occur there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it won't be any harder to swim back to normal.
Try to target a place where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills, whether you've been spotted or not, you can wait for a rescue.
Homecoming shock occurs earlier than cultural shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who have easily assimilated to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to return to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have become accustomed to the new culture and have lost some of your own customs from your home culture.
At the beginning of their foreign journey, people were probably patient and understanding and knew that travelers to a new country needed to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound of the pyramid and the light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you can always hear the tourists and the vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is behind the scenes and the narrator of a long story.
These scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, and the residential area is called Villa Las Estrellas (The Road of Stars).
Other islands include Livingstone and Deception, whose volcanic lake has provided a spectacular natural harbour above an active volcano.
The Thoroughbred Land is an area in the south of the peninsula bounded by the Blingshausen Sea.
The peninsular mountains merge with the plateau here, then re-peak to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which rises to 4,892 m (16,939 ft) on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, with no cell phone coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not generally a replacement for mobile phones, as to make a phone call you need to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite.
The services to the world are used by vessels, including pleasure and tourist boats that have data and remote audio requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to the service.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular is for people who plan to take a year off and dedicate it to travel and learning.
It is especially popular with those who have just left school and allows them to take a year off before college without risking their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually, a fee is charged for enrolling in these programs.
Finland is a great boating destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and offshore islands.
You don't necessarily need a boat in this complex of islands and lakes.
Although the Algiers archipelago of islands and larger lakes is large enough for sailboats, small boats and even paddle boats offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It's similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it's very unique (in the Netherlands, for example, it's one in forty).
A characteristic of many Baltic cruises is that they have a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days visiting the historic city, while returning to the ship for a night's sleep.
If you only take part in the cruise by cruise ships, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochure. But as you can see from the map above of Berlin, no part of the city is close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they've never flown before or experienced a heartbreaking accident.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike the personal fear and loathing of other things that exists in many people.
For some, understanding how aircraft work and what happens in flight may help them overcome the fear of the unknown and the lack of control.
Pick-up companies get good money for fast delivery of products. Usually, time is of the essence in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for quick repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes, there was a problem for the smaller companies.
If they sent things by air mail, it could take days on some routes to get air and customs loading.
The only way to get there faster was to send it as a checked baggage. Airline regulations would not allow them to send it without a passenger.
The most common way to fly first-class or business class is to pay a hefty fee for a ticket (or better yet, ask your airline to arrange it).
However, it doesn't come cheap: a general rule says you can expect to pay four times the normal rent paid for economy mode for business mode and eleven times that for first class!
Overall, searching for discounts on business and first class seats on flights from point A to point B is useless.
Airlines are well aware that a group of air passengers with emergency conditions are willing to pay a lot of money to get the benefit of fast and convenient travel, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that suffers from ethnic and tribal conflict.
In 1994, this dispute led to the creation of the autonomous republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and common currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion of the Moldovans is Orthodox Christianity.

Please visit this place with all the dignity, the honor and the respect it deserves.
Do not deface this place by painting walls or carving in buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is recognized in law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other places.
Regular notifications in the metro are only in Catalan, but out-of-program announcements are made by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are egotistical, rude and arrogant.

If you show some basic manners, the unexpected Parisian behavior will be immediately eliminated.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has an abundant forest cover and is mainly covered with varieties of ash, Christmas pine and spruce trees and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a considerable diversity of plant communities due to the large extent of micro-regions, different soils and different elevations.
The area is also home to a very diverse range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, black bear, wildcat and black rhino can be found here along with many other common species.
During visits to monasteries, women are required to wear knee-covering socks and shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries have appropriate coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your coverings especially brightly colored coverings, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun upon entering.
Under similar conditions, men are also required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
It can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the lobby, but the clothes are not washed by the user after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For all men, one size fits all!

All names, besides the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even if they come in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and verbs.
It also makes reading considerably easier, although writing is somewhat complex and requires knowing whether a verb or adjective is used correctly.

The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowels that follow them.
Also, be careful to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian grammar is relatively simple and mostly regular.
So, reading this grammar primer will help you to know more about Persian grammar and understand the phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know one of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, those who knew a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is so close that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now generally abandoned and are now museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution was not initially a problem but is now, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses and are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable climatic conditions.
The cherry blossom has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, where the cherry blossom was the apple blossom.
In Japan, the first cherry blossoming ceremony is performed by the emperor and only for him and members of the nobility close to the imperial court.

Singapore is generally very safe and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But being in the Arctic, just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with the heat (always) and the intense sunlight (when the sky is clear and very little occurs).
Also, a small number of buses head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of great biblical leaders including Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take is going to Jerusalem and not just the Jewish suburb of Arba'a.
The Inland Waterways can be a good choice for a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or traveling to interesting places on the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also determine popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus Christ.
Many of the holiday's traditions have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Eid al-Fitr in the open to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian religious justifications for this custom, but it is safe to say that it may have been a celebration of spring and harvest in pre-Christian times.
Most traditional churches often hold the Saturday evening Easter Vigil during the Easter holiday, while this congregation often celebrates at midnight for the celebration of the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first reached the islands either came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals couldn't travel there, so the giant tortoise is the main animal that feeds in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced to the island, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North Pole or the South Pole in winter, you'll see the polar night, meaning that the sun never rises above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky will be more or less dark during the night.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and often do not have light pollution, you can also enjoy the stars.
