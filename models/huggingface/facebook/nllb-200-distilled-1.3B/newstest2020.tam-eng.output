The only real solution is that if I do what I believe in, people will follow.
So my wife and I walk 10 km a week to buy vegetables.
It has been going on for six months now and it has become a habit.
I am very satisfied now".

But they laughed at it.
So my wife and I went to the market carrying a bamboo basket.
I realized then that it would be very helpful in many ways.
Many young people these days are not in good health.

The Election Commission has reduced the disqualification period of Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh from 6 years to one year and one month.
This has removed the impasse in contesting the Tamang by-election.
Sikkim Assembly elections were held along with Lok Sabha elections.
The Sikkim Grindkari Morcha won the election by a landslide.
The party leader Prem Singh Tamang took over as the Chief Minister of the state.
But in 2016, a lower court sentenced Tamang to jail in a corruption case.
This was confirmed by the Supreme Court and he was jailed.
The controversy erupted when Tamang took office because a convicted corruption convict could not run for office for six years.
Damang is contesting the Sikkim Assembly by-election.
With the support of the BJP, Daman is in power in Sikkim.
Meanwhile, Tamang had sent a letter to the Election Commission, citing various legal clauses, asking for the removal of the six-year ban on him contesting the election.
The Election Commission, having considered the letter, has announced that the period of the ban on Damanku will be reduced to one year and one month.
This does not prevent Tamang from contesting the Assembly by-election.
The BJP can now use the privilege given to Tamanka to play its politics in other states including Tamil Nadu.
The BJP's wishes can be fully fulfilled by the Election Commission and its reports.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not merely a matter of praise that Bhagat Singh and his companions have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to revolutionary movements and hence to Indian politics.
We can still see a perception among the people that revolutionaries are just fools and stone-throwers who do not care about human lives.
The Bhagat Singh period reminds us of his humanity, clear thinking and skill.
After the April 1929 Assembly bombing, Bhagat Singh's name spread in India.
He was a bit more popular in Tamil Nadu and made his public debut in 1930.
But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most amazing news in history, no leader born in Uttarakhand, including Gandhi, has been mentioned in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
It is because of Father Periyar.
The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial was published in the Republican Weekly titled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's characteristic interests and offered some observations on the political situation of the day.
Excerpts from the article:-
"In fact, if Bhagat Singh had been convinced that his principles were right and if he had decided that the way he lived was the right way to live, we would say that he should have lived as he did and if he had not lived as he did, we would say that he was not a decent man.
So now let's call him a real person.
It is our strong opinion that India really needs the ideals of Bhagat Singh.
If Mr. Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and lived, this victory would not have been so popular.
And we say that if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhi would still be alive.
Why did Bhagwat Singh, who was to die of an accidental illness and be left in ashes, give his life to show the people of India the path to true equality and peace for the people of the world?
We congratulate him with our hearts, lips and hands for the achievements of ordinary people".
This was stated by Father Periyar in the editorials of the Republican newspaper.
A police officer, Dennis Turner, who was on duty at the school where the incident took place, has arrested a girl who was walking in the school for kicking the teacher.

His fingerprints have also been taken.
The girl's family was informed and she was handed over to her family.
It is not known if he took another child to the police station.
In an interview with the media, Kirkland, her grandmother, who has agreed to reveal the identity of the girl, said that her granddaughter suffers from sleep apnea and sometimes has these hiccups as a result of the medication she takes.
I was shocked to hear that he was arrested for this, and that it was difficult for any 6-year-old to understand and explain.

The DMK has asked Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami how many checkpoints were built during the last 8 years of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) rule.
In a statement, the party treasurer Durai Murugan criticised the CM for being too vague about the public works sector.
The Economist Dhirimurugan in his report said that the water released in the Cauvery is being mixed in the sea in vain due to the negligence of the AUMC government and lack of administrative skills.
Our leader M. K. Stalin, in his capacity as Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, had expressed his concern that the A. D. M. K. government had no concrete plan to stop the Kaveri Pass.
Etapadi Palanishamy, who thought the CM's reply was a reply, asked, "Did the DMK, who accuse us, build a checkpoint at Cauvery during their rule?"
"I would like to inform him that we have built a checkpoint at Maynoor in Kaveri under the DMK.
Can Chief Minister Edappadi Palanishamy, who has the Public Works Department in charge without even knowing that detail, speak out of turn?
The dam at Maynoor raised the water level in the area.
So farming flourished.
And today, we can see that thousands of farmers in the area are always grateful to the Union Government.
The dam was built by the Union Government at Maynoor as per the need of the time.
At that time, there was no need to build more dams.
If it was necessary, the artist, who was the chief minister at the time, would have given immediate approval, allocated funds and accelerated the work.
Therefore, Edappadi is far from being able to blame the Congress government for Kaveri's well-being.
I ask you, how many dams have you built in Cauvery in the last eight years of the A.M.C. rule?
The other question is, during the DMK rule, we have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu.
Can you name a single dam built under the A.D.M.C. regime so far?
Don't lie to me.
If the Leader of the Opposition is not answering their accusation, please tell us with evidence that we are building or planning to build a barrier in the following places.
"It is my duty to point out that while it may be nice for a personal person to say that the DMK government did not build a barrier at Kaveri, it is not a civilized act or beauty for his position as the Chief Minister", Dhirubhai Murugan said.
The State Bank of India has decided to fix the interest rate on a repo basis from October 1.
In view of the economic growth of the country, the RBI has reduced the short term repo rate by 1.1 per cent in four consecutive installments so far.
But the banks are accused of not paying even half of that to their customers.
Currently, banks are setting the interest rate in the form of MCLR.
The RBI has directed that from October 1, the rate of interest will be based on the Treasury Bill and the repo rate issued by the government for short term loans.
Accordingly, the State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to adjust the MCLR rate for home, auto loans and micro, small and medium enterprises loans from October 1.

DMK leader M.K. Stalin visited the excavation sites in the valley of the river, which showcase the Tamil culture.
The results of the excavations revealed that the Tamil people who lived their lives in flesh and blood, as described in the literature of the Sangam period, were their own lives, not myths.
The urban civilization on the northern banks of the Ganges started in the 6th century.
But the archaeological evidence below has scientifically proven that the Tamils lived a high-class urban life in the 6th century BC on the southern bank of the Vaigai River, and that the Tamils were literate and well educated and lived a very prosperous life.
The findings of the excavations below have created a situation that will rewrite the history of the Indian subcontinent.
A large number of people visit the bottom ditch site, which is a source of pride for every Tamil.
Recently, the Chief Coordinator of the Tamil Nadu Party, Seeman Baladi, visited the excavation site.
He was followed by DMK leader M.K. Stalin who visited the dig sites today.
He was accompanied by CPM MP S. Venkatesan and a number of DIMU's senior executives.

Trump asks for an investigation of the Ukrainian president
The White House confirmed that a phone call from President Donald Trump to Ukraine's president about a possible Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, was true.
The Democratic Party has proposed a House of Representatives impeachment resolution against Trump, calling it a mistake to pressure other countries to investigate the US president.
Six committees have been constituted by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy on this matter and an inquiry has been opened into the President's action.
Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25th, so investigate", Trump said.
The White House officially released a statement yesterday on what the two presidents discussed.
So it is accepted that this conversation was real.
Speaking to reporters outside the UN, Donald Trump said the request was made amicably.
He said that no pressure was put on the Ukrainian president.
But one thing to note is that the US government suddenly suspended some $400 million in financial aid to Ukraine.
After some time, the funds were allocated.
The Democrats are tying this to Trump's remarks to the president.
So this incident has started to stir up a storm in American politics.

"Who do you want to push, who is the greatest?" he asked, and he beat the reporters who pushed him.
The minister, who knew he was drunk, ordered him to leave immediately.

Minister of Tamil Language and Tamil Culture K. Pandiarajan, in the presence of Jayakandan, Kadhar and G. Bhaskaran, Minister of State for Rural Industries, told reporters:
The excavation of the lower 5th phase marks a turning point in the history of Sangak in Tamil Nadu.
The lower part of the city was a prosperous area from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD.
The study examines urbanization on the banks of the Vaishali River based on the available evidence.
Scientific chronology at the bottom of the excavation has concluded that the Tamil-Brahmin period is 100 years older. The study shows that Tamil Nadu was a literate society as early as the 6th century BC.
The samples of 70 skeletons have been sent to the Deccan College, a postgraduate and research institution for scientific analysis.
The analysis of these spiders was conducted by classifying the species of whales, buffalo, octopus, wild boar, catfish and moose.
The study also found that cattle, buffalo and goats are used for agriculture and for food as some of the cattle, such as the Kalaiman, the Wollad and the wild boar, have been found to have spots.
The results of this analysis show that the Sangakkal community was primarily agricultural and also involved in animal husbandry.
Samples of brick-lined roof tiles and chalk-lined textile veneer have been sent to Vellore Technical University for analysis.
In each of these, minerals like silicon, lime, iron, aluminum and magnesium are found in the study.
To preserve such rare objects, work is underway to build a museum at the main site at an estimated cost of Rs.20 crore to make the lower part of the site more accessible to Tamil scholars, students and the general public.
The excavation work will be extended for two weeks and will continue.
The Minister of Tamil Language and Tamil Culture, K. Pandiarajan said that the State Government will be working with the Central Government on the excavation of Phase 6 at four sites next year.

Is the BJP taking over the caste politics in Tamil Nadu?
It is said that if the BJP cannot keep the hammer and pomegranate blooming in Tamil Nadu, it will eventually take caste politics into its own hands.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, Tamil Nadu was in a position to look at the camel.
After this, during the second time, i.e. the last parliamentary elections, Amitabh Shah said, "I don't know what you will do.
But the contested seats were all in the dust.
The BJP is being praised all over the country but the wave of opposition is still brewing in Tamil Nadu.
It is above all the issue of triple talaq, Kashmir issue, imposition of Hindi, one nation one language.
It is all together that we can still see in the customs.
This is why the BJP leadership is so hard on the BJP administrators in Tamil Nadu and why it is said that even the state leadership is still in trouble.
On one hand, the BJP has a plan to root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu by the next assembly elections.
The BJP leadership seems to have almost reached a conclusion with a direct field report, intelligence report etc.
Accordingly, there is a perception among the people of the respective communities that the two Dravidian parties, Aam Aadmi Party or Dravidian Party, do not give enough importance to the people of the Nadar ethnic group, the people of the Vanni ethnic group and the people of the Devendra Khelala ethnic group.
This is said to be a pity for the Dravidian parties.
This is the very principle that the BJP has begun to implement as a tactic.
The decision to honour a position in a way that makes the race proud or important.
The appointment of Tamiliza Chaudhary Rajan as Governor of Telangana is one such instance.
Similarly, the BJP government is also reportedly focusing on the top-level Nadas in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP acts in this way to honour each caste, it will bring pride and happiness to the respective caste.
And, in any case, this caste politics will be a problem for the BJP.
At the same time, it is uncertain whether these actions of the BJP will add fuel to the flames as Tamil Nadu is already falling behind in caste politics.
It is true that if the caste fire were to burn, even a little tamarisk in Tamil Nadu would burn in the same fire.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not utter a single word on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during his address to the United Nations today.
The 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly is currently underway.
The Prime Minister Narendra Modi has addressed the meeting on behalf of India today.

Modi said that India is contributing a lot towards the solution of the global warming problem and that India's contribution to global warming is less and the solution is more.
The Government of India is making a concerted effort to make India a plastic free country.
He said that a massive health insurance scheme is being implemented in India.
Yathum Ore, listen, PM Modi has made a wonderful speech in Tamil to the world at the UN
But nowhere in his speech did he mention anything about the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
This is because the Central Government is firmly of the view that Jammu and Kashmir is India's internal affair.
Political observers say Modi did not say a word about Jammu and Kashmir on purpose, while Pakistan wants to make it an international issue.
This has sent a message to the world that Kashmir is India's internal affair.
