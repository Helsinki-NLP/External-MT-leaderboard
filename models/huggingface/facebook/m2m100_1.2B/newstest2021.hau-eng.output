This is why the Chinese authorities have increased their commitment to ensuring national food security.
In the 71 years since the collapse of the Republic of China, the country has achieved major achievements in food supply, which has made it a worldwide surprise to see the number of citizens who, according to the policy, showed China's population increased by 1.4 billion.
This attempt contributed to the intensification of the legislation which led China to provide the world’s largest-speed de-escalation, as the chairman of the board of directors of China’s military industry Zhang Wufeng has repeatedly stated that, from 1949 until now, in the legislation, China has made the subject of an impasse in carrying out all the activities of the country’s transportation.

He also said Ke Bingsheng, the former president of the Chinese military university, China has achieved major successes by increasing domestic and food consumption when compared to the early implementation of the intermittent practice at home and opening the door to the public.
Huang Jikun, director of the research center of China's Beijing university's military operation, explained while interacting with the editor of the journal "The China Science Daily", according to a report by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is now in 2 or three years to come, or China will be able to decrease the number of shellfish and shellfish of its population in the military buildings.

INEC is preparing for the election of Edo -Farfesa Jacob.
President of the National Election Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, stated that the council has suspended its preparation for the conduct of the elections to the State of Edo, which will be held on September 19.
Jacob made this encouraging announcement on Thursday, when he was in contact with the Commissioner for Security and Security in Benin, the capital of the state of Edo.
Professor said INEC has so far achieved successful implementation of the scheme up to one in 10 of the 14 who claimed implementation based on the vote.
Jacob added that, the reason for this failure is because of the kind of programs that were started from now before the upcoming election date.
Make sure we get all the reporting programs that are relevant.
But nevertheless we will make it convenient for us to come over to us, because you will see our endorsement.
This court issued a schedule for how the Edo and Ondo proposal steps will be implemented, as of February 6, 2020.
This is where we offer a period of almost nine to eight months to prepare two very important events.
Today I am confident that we have implemented the 10-process of 14 with INEC’s planned implementation.
And no one was given a penalty until he was returned from the day it was to be executed.
Finally, it is a sign of continuing registration that will lead to the 14th generations who will be able to catch up with the machine of Jacob.
He said the four activities that undermined the INEC included announcing an election announcement to be made next Tuesday, announcing the representatives of each association that joined, every day.
And also shut down the shuttle hours 24 before choosing.
Which will be closed by the 12th session of the class on Thursday, before the Saturday session will be selected.
Therefore, we said that we also rejected what we thought, and then the ears of the day had only been chosen.
In the heart of Jacob.
He also suggested that the elections to the anti-Edo state are the first elections and the INEC will begin to run during the coronavirus.
On this, he said the board has chosen the rules on how to conduct the vote in this environment.
We strike the system and regulations in a few elections, districts in the State of Nasarawa.
And we are preparing to replicate the system in this big selection in Edo.
Since the first Election Commissioner of the State of Edo, Johnson Alalibo, that there have been 2,210,534 million people registered in the State of Edo.
He said 1,159,325 million men, women and 1,051,209 million.

How Ganduje dealt with the rulers of King Ado and Sanusi, will dealt with the rulers of their lists in Kano.
President Abdullahi Ganduje urged the State Law Assembly of Kano to amend the 2019 state law, as it will ensure that other major disputes between the two Canons and the King Ado Bayero and the King Sanusi have disappeared, as the state law will ensure their unity as the chief judges of the kingdom in Kano.
Abdullah Gafasa, Chairman of the Assembly of Kano, has read the requirement for Ganduje in the presidential elections, and is expected to have a private discussion before the end of July.
The judge appointed by their teachers of the Canaanites is the Almighty One and, who made the King of the Canaanites and Cyroman of the Canaanites, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.

In addition to this, Gadaka said, "In the same part, our co-government Yobe added to us other tools, large-scale vehicles and vehicles that we will use to conduct our operations in an easy way, especially for keeping our employees to the office due to displacement to a bar, when we start working together."
He also said that at the moment the company is now sending 25 young people to learn how to operate machines and devices with controlling the products the company uses to address the activities you have and how to engage in business and public relationships that they are interested in.
