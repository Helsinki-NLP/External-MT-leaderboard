In China, two men killed by suicide.
Previously, one of the suspected had already committed a suicide attempt.
On October 30, around 1:00 a.m., in the village of Lugovo, in the place of his residence, a man of 1947 born committed suicide by hanging.
He has previously attempted suicide.
What led the man to such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, died in the place of residence.
No signs of violent death have been found, the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "Kineshemsky" reports.
Do you have a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money for repairing the rotating highway system, many begin to see the solution in a small black box carefully arranged on your car’s accessory panel.
These devices, tracking every mile passed by the driver and transmitting this information to officials, are at the heart of the controversial attempt to modernize the old American highway financing system, undertaken by the Washington and State Planning Authorities.
The typically boring arena of highway planning suddenly raised intense debates and colourful alliances.
Liberals have joined environmental groups in lobbying giving the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and even, possibly, where you travel them – and then use this information when making tax accounts.
The movement of the tea in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues regarding privacy.
And although Congress can not yet agree whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They are thinking about how in the next decade we can move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they pass.
Thousands of drivers have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ichrat, the executive director of the Association of Southern California Governments, which is preparing plans to start the state authorities tracking the miles passed by each California driver by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technology for this already exists.
The need for this is worsened by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the construction of highways, funded by the taxes that Americans pay on car supplies.
The Americans no longer buy as much fuel as before.
Car runs more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don’t want to raise the tax even by one cent with high fuel prices.
“Bensin tax is simply impossible to preserve,” said Lee Manic, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test a false payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Zanuadi calls this a compassionate user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce the load of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The California Planning Authority is monitoring this system as it develops strategies to the targets set by the ambitious laws of the state to combat global warming.
However, Bill Schuster, a member of the House of Representatives (Republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of the transport committee of the House, said that he also sees this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market supporters at Reason fund are also excited that they will force drivers to pay for each mile.
“This is not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards fair payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, involving about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators, who represent voters, who in their daily lives often have to travel a lot of miles to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go this path on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile of run instead of the gasoline tax.
The pilot project in Nevada has been completed.
It is being examined in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 eastern coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they will be able to carry out these changes.
This concept has not received general recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track each of their steps.
“The concern about the ‘big brother’ and similar things is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada State Department of Transport.
It was not what people wanted.
When the trials were ongoing, the U.S. Civil Liberties Association in Nevada warned on its website: “It’s not easy to turn these devices into full-scale monitoring devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, tremendous technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states where difficult searches are being carried out for cheap technology that would allow the state authorities to report the mile passed by the car, but without any information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Han said, the society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not contribute to the tax collection of the state.
It sought to come out to the emerging type of car insurance market, where drivers pay on the basis of the gap.
But the devices she’s testing attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is regularly charged with a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed or their location,” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
There were a few major errors in some of these pilot programs of the state.
There are much less expensive and less invasive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with various options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely give up the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles passed by all inhabitants of the state.
In other places they hope to sell the idea to the alert public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are looking to develop a taxation device that will also accept payments on parking calculators, provide a “pay as you drive” insurance and collect real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid breakthroughs.
“Automobilists will be attracted to the participation of the benefit they will offer,” the document of urban planning states.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering whether not all the talks about false payments are just a huge distractive factor.
In the city transport commission in the Gulf area of San Francisco officials say that the congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trusted road construction fund by raising gasoline taxes.
Additional one-time or annual tax could be charged from the drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline so that they pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is to take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the legislation and public relations committee.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their private life and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in the event of economic pressure of Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official, directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
Analysts, surveyed by Reuters, doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements on the terms of financing.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to obtain aid, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered on Friday the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one degree - to "B-" from "B".
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can demonstrate flexibility in the loaning conditions, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, the majority of the supplies of which are now from Russia.
Per it will be gas from the "North Stream" or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reversive supplies to Ukraine can only be used within a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
“There are negotiations between the EU countries and the Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes,” the source added.
Russia Out of the Struggle for City Pollution by Car
Attempts to solve the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most metropolis of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their restructuring and the expansion of highways, or attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
A widely known example of Singapore, where a rigorous quota of the increase in the number of private cars is introduced, and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be twice or three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have imposed a fee for entrance to the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zones are introduced, where only vehicles with a specific ecological class are allowed to enter, also using high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
Beijing’s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “Five-Year Clean Air Plan” in 2012 worth approximately 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As told "Ъ" director of the transport pollution control department of the municipal environmental protection office of Beijing, Li Kunsheng, the main goal of five years is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increasing the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (currently 5.2 million), as well as increasing no more than 5% fuel consumption per vehicle.
According to the agency, automotive transportation in Beijing is currently responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program are the limitation of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Moreover, the urban measures of the Green Five Year include accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and car and fuel labelling, the restriction on the entry of cars to the central part of the city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (except the creation of encouraging financial programs to replace old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
The number of automotive innovations in Beijing also includes the ban for all private cars to drive within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of China their six) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the vehicle number), as well as the issuance of registration marks for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number in 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 they were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011, 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities came to "preventive sources".
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation, it is only starting to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Director of the Institute of Transport Economy and Transport Policy, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for road travel are obviously unpopular, they can be accepted by society only under the condition of their full universality.
In the case of Moscow there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its car park, where there are two clusters less sensitive to any regulatory impacts - office and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand (approximately 5% of the total number of the car park of Moscow).
In recent days, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg have prepared a study that analyses the balance of urban territories between the housing building, the area of road coverage and the number of motor vehicles.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city centre is provided by roads twice as much as required, and most car drivers living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time on the parking lot or simply on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking spaces, but car warehouses, not to expand, but to reduce the passing part (to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the protected area of the historic center (a total area of about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city).
The penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vologde will increase in times
According to the city authorities, an increase in the size of the penalties will help to establish order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and looms.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, the products they realize often do not go through appropriate sanitary controls.
And that means that the health of the volgae is threatened.
So, the lower boundary for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase by six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Administration of Vologda reports.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily the crisis of unpaid payments for unassured consumer loans and the mass reduction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it is entirely caused by consumption, which almost does not slow down the turnover," Goldman Sachs' chief economist for Russia, Clemens Grafe, said, presenting a quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wages increase in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately the current level, expect Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are most likely to take care of optimizing staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
Companies are facing a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to dismissals and unemployment growth.
The Russian business cannot not raise wages, commented Barclays Capital’s chief economist Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment is close to historical low, competition for workers is high.
In order to remove employees from the side or retain current employees, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is supported by a very rapid growth in demand credit.
According to Mr. Graffe, due to the extremely high interest rates on consumer loans multiplicative effect on the economy of the country this type of loan does not have.
"The benefits for the economy from the growth of credit we have not seen any, the money is not divided by the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is another - Goldman Sachs is expecting a rise in delay on unassured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide for.
The interest rates for such loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often,” Mr. Grafe noted.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible non-payment crisis for unassured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of WSE, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing the signs of a rising banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources that the state banks have, were forced to attract the funds of the population at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went on the path of war and began to lower credit rates, the economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up the dumping, Russia is threatening a full banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks the economist considers a predictor of a mass collapse.
“The state banks themselves will not deal with this situation: the deposit insurance system was initially not intended for a systemic crisis,” the head of the institution warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down and without a non-payment crisis, the investment bank believes, - due to the refusal to index the wages of state officials and military, set in the current version of the budget project.
Partly, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the frozen tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if investments don’t grow (and there’s no prerequisite for this – see the report), the growth of consumption will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital has not yet seen any preconditions for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is that oil prices continue to fall,” he says.
According to his estimates, the economy of Russia will begin to decline at oil prices below $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet able to lower the interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation decreased and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean they didn’t believe the central bank that announced the transition to targeting inflation,” Clemens Graffe said.
The interest policy of the Central Bank on market rates does not affect, it only affects the interest rates of interbank loans.
“For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes,” Clemens Grafe said.
The money obtained at the auctions of the central banks is not used by banks to borrow the economy, but to manage its liquidity.
As soon as the rate decreases, the currency rate immediately changes, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
"The Central Bank will soon or later realize that this strategy doesn't work," Mr. Graffe said, reminding that the state plans to put the ruble in "free swimming" by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do this earlier or raise the key rate of the central bank (5,5%), he says.
According to his estimates, the price of the ruble is now artificially exceeded by 10%.
The only way to weaken is to lose weight, the expert makes the conclusion.
But if the central bank will hide in the financiers even the shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the weakening policy of the ruble, it can break the ruble much stronger.
The second congress of the peoples of the South Ural was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People's Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian state and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
In the work of the congress participated delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive bodies - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening the international agreement.
Here we can show an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
There are no differences and disagreements.
We live in complete mutual understanding,” says Theofan, Metropolitan Chelyabinsky and Zlatoustovsky.
The meeting discussed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
According to the results of the meeting, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the Opera and Ballet Theatre.
There was an exhibition of the national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the US intelligence issue
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence developer, said he was ready to go to Berlin to give testimony to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Kit Alexander are unable to answer questions about their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Straubele on Thursday met with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, which the deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, it was said: “While the outcome of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat misunderstanding as a betrayal and strives to criminalize political statements with criminal accusations that don’t give any protection.”
But saying the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to refuse criminal charges against him.
The accusations brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany became narrow after the allegations that the NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who leads a parliamentary group curating the intelligence service, said that if there is a possibility to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, "not putting him in danger and not destroying his relationship with the United States completely", it should be used.
Mr. Ströbel, a parliamentary member from the Green Party of Germany, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter page.
During his visit to Russia he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbel said that, according to the former contractor’s lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden gave testimony in Germany, he would need the guarantees that he would be there “in safety,” the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he was faced with a “hard and constant” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was enthusiastic about the world’s response to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials – including in the United States – considered the disclosure of the uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
Frontier Airlines will be charging a manual deposit fee
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying a hand deposit on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a hand deposit and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to leave the entire bank.
The new handbag fee is extended to bags in the upper baggage sections, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25, if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers will pay, only having been at the departure.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Molly said a $100 fee should make passengers take care of payments in advance.
“We don’t want to pay for it,” she said.
The airlines began charging the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges, get as much as they can, in the hand baggage placed in the upper baggage seats, which often leads to lack of space in these seats.
Taxes are one of the ways to force passengers to carry less on board.
O'Melley said that this new collection was not actually for making money.
The fact is that the most loyal customers of Frontier say that finding a place in the upper baggage seats is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in a row at the Frontier flight can get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in a row can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Melley said that the change of the procedures on the website and on the Frontier registration stores is aimed at ensuring that passengers will be aware of the fee before they get to land.
The new Frontier for the manual deposit will not begin to be charged before summer, although the date is not yet established.
Passengers often complain about the baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that the baggage processing costs money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider adding luggage fees a sign of the fact that airlines are charging enough money to cover the costs of flights after a few years of losses.
However, most of them did not deal with the fees for the hand deposit.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced its first manual deposit three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discount later followed its example.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is carefully monitoring the additional fees.
According to his estimates in a December 2011 report, the collection for the manual deposit brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and he was curious that he would find at the departure when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit fee for a hand deposit.
“The landing process was the most smooth of what I’ve seen during my career in airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see a tooth crush and the appearance of a struggle at the departure.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing went fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit in relation to a fee of $2 for coffee, tea, gasing or juice.
Frontier said passengers receiving gas or juice could leave the whole bank and that the coffee will be provided for free.
It will continue to distribute water for free.
US Airways recently tried to pay for drinks in 2008, but refused it seven months after the passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed the example.
Frontier’s initiative to pay for a hand deposit when passengers don’t buy tickets directly from the airline is its last measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay to online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to contact a tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went further to everyone in this area.
In September, it began to give twice less bonus miles of frequently flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the mile of travel.
So, a trip 1000 miles from Frontier, purchased from an online tourist agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
Moreover, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming losing.
Revenue decreased by 9 percent, and summer opportunities decreased by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to repair the funds of Frontier as part of the airline’s sale.
ANB blames “internal error” and not the hackers in the interruption of the site
The secret agency of national security said on Friday evening that the interruption of their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, according to the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claims that the failure in the work was caused by a distributed attack of the type of “denial in service” [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, the online server monitoring systems registered that the site of the ANB did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
An ANB spokesman earlier told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network “no” was broken.
No secret information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of hackers-activists said that they are responsible for the dismantling of the site by means of a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to catch the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site disappears.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret ANB, once named “No such agency”, has been in the center of public attention and sharp criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and within the country – all this is a reaction to the secret files of the ANB stolen from the agency and published by the disappointed former ANB employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has caused doubts that the current incident was the result of targeted action by hackers.
Bombardier’s profits decrease with the drop in supplies and aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, said on Thursday that its net profit was reduced by 15 percent due to the decreased number of aircraft orders and supplies in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway division.
The company based in Montreal, Bombardier, has also not published any data on its latest CSeries flight tests and has not provided any new information about whether ambitious plans for the commercial launch of the aircraft will be fulfilled by September next.
After the first flight of the experimental sample of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flighted only three times, causing questions about whether the phase of testing is scheduled.
The results did not justify the forecasts and led to a fall of more than 8 percent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst of the National Bank Financial, lowered its estimate from “over the midnight” to “over the midnight” on Thursday because he believes that the growth of shares is limited to the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft supplies was generally predictable, we are disappointed by the transport department’s profit indicators,” Dorxen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the air test program continues.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we predict that the market will be more skeptical to deal with the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family will allow it to take a place in the low price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominating.
The first experimental sample of the aircraft was presented in March and made the first flight in September after a few months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries are not too many – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the summer tests to check the company’s claims on fuel efficiency and the potential economy of the new aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier will reach its goal in 300 firm orders as soon as the first aircraft will be launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward according to the plan.
“The test model of the aircraft didn’t stay on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during a telephone conference, adding that the aircraft was scheduled for ground tests and software updates.
All manufacturers plan tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did.
This will happen throughout the summer test program.
The second of the five test samples is expected to make a flight in the coming weeks and the rest will soon follow it, the company.
And yet analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the deadline and will provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow rate of flight testing – although it is apparent, and is in line with the Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that the introduction will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerxen said.
In the third quarter, ending September 30, Bombardier's net revenue dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The corrected profit per share remained the previous – 9 cents.
The gross income decreased slightly – from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer that it placed 45 aircraft per quarter, which is less than the indicator for the previous year – 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders of the aerospace department amounted to $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged since December 31.
“In the aerospace area, the results matched our goals, but a small number of receiving orders and general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
The gross income in the aerospace direction fell by 13 percent – to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said the gross income in this sector grew almost 11 percent – to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, which is slightly higher than the indicator from December 31.
The income of the transport unit has been negatively affected by problems with the execution of several major contracts.
The management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced that Google’s chief financial director Patrick Pichett will enter the board of directors, dropped by 8.5 percent – to C$4.83 on shares in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor Bombardier, announced a quarterly income decrease by 10 percent on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profits
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, after completing the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, cut the profit forecast for the current financial year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more shocking than expected due to a decline in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony’s television business, which in the second quarter brought the company the first in three years operating profit of 5.2 billion yen, in the reporting period again fell to 9.3 billion yen operating loss.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, especially due to the decline in demand for TVs.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main competitors, Panasonic, has recently shifted emphasis on industrial components: here the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to obtain 179 billion yen operating profits against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts predicted that this figure would be significantly higher and will amount to 221 billion yen.
To get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month it was announced the start of the sales of "smart" clocks from the Japanese corporation, equipped with a number of fashion features that will allow you to get rid of the need for 100 times a day to deliver from your pocket a smartphone.
After Sony dropped its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company’s shares lost more than 11% in the morning at the opening of the shares in Tokyo, falling to the level of 1668 yen per share.
Speech gen was a stimulant for synapses.
Scientists from John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein that allows Foxp2 to perform its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study was published in Science, on the website of the magazine you can read its short content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genes whose function is directly linked to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who couldn’t speak the words correctly and sometimes even didn’t understand each other.
Scientists found that family members had a disruption in the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function, remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its Foxp2 functions performs as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with speech formation.
This is done by another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 genes found by the authors, while Foxp2 is only active.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization, scientists confirmed in the experiment on mice.
When the gene activity was artificially reduced in animals, they cried less when divided with the mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sound was also restored.
Previously, the mice also showed a connection with the vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals that introduced a human copy of the gene were eating more active and at a lower frequency than ordinary mice.
Until now, however, scientists don’t know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 controlled by it is linked with purely “mechanical” sound formation properties or thinner processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation is imprisoned
42-Year-Old Basharat Ditta Transmitted Information to Criminal Authority by Nilu Scarborough
A lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug baron about a large police investigation because he was afraid to reveal his secret drug addiction was sentenced to three years in prison.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditt has sent to the criminal authority the secret information about his investigation into illegal drug trafficking after he was threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who was named Bash and named among the criminals a “great lawyer”, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to monitor Scarborough, which he previously represented at a drug-related court.
Officers noticed that the 32-year-old Scarborough left three packages of cocaine at the house of a lawyer in the city of Blackburn County of Lancashire while he was at a lawyer association dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditt was "regularly consuming" a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his paper and on his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried illegally to obtain information about the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his fellow members.
All four suspects were at the time under police surveillance as part of an extensive investigation of the heroin and cocaine sale activities of the criminal organization in Lancashire, Cambodia, Mersiside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police pulled heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million and more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
The 42-year-old Dita was giving the information to the criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Royal Court of Liverpool, Ditt, who works in the legal company Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, was covered with shame after recognizing him guilty in two cases of intentionally interfering with justice as a result of a three-week court in the Court of Crown in Liverpool.
He acknowledged the storage of cocaine at one of the previous trials.
The lawyer's disclosure occurred after the police investigating Scarborough's activities found that he regularly spoke with Ditt by phone from February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found how he approached the house of Ditt in Blackburn and placed drugs of 60 percent purity in a black golf gloves under the laundry boxes of the lawyer.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called with Ditt, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine talks took place between them.
The court found that Ditt was "regularly consuming" cocaine after tests found traces of class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditt was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he was talking to the suspected dealer as he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “advocate secret.”
During his arrest, Ditt took his paper and tried to get out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, he was also taken a hair sample.
At a police interrogation, he said that along with his workplace, he had a home office, and the clients came to him home for legal matters.
However, the court became known that after important arrests he called the major participants of illegal drug trafficking, a number of which he previously represented in the court to tell what detectives know about them.
In the accusation speech, Anne White said, “If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditt is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered a too close relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug trader, but a drug trader who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will surely be fair because he was their lawyer.
However, this significantly exceeded the boundaries of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditt didn’t read his profession, but scared her.
He was too close to certain customers, in particular Scarborough, and allowed him to doubt his uninterest.
“If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to transmit the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, I would do it immediately.”
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Holsted from Lancashire police said: “Mr. Ditt has turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal criminal as soon as he began to acquire drugs from organized crime.”
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main participants of criminal groups, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and bring confidence and confidence to the community.
Mr. Ditt gave up that trust and tried to hide with his profession.
The investigation in Mr. Ditt's case led Lancashire's unit for dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced for him for three cases of cocaine storage, and now also for the obstacle to justice, demonstrating our desire to a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning for criminals that no one is outside the law.
We will find you and bring you to court responsibility.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after he acknowledged his fault in conspiracy with the aim of delivering heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Thirty-five other people involved in the massacre were sentenced to 153 years in prison for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditt organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing customers with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner is Muhammad Ali, and the motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready for the reception of 22 thousand viewers, the police officials, who were present today at the meeting of the KDK of the Russian Federation, said.
The ticket program is overlooked, according to them, about twice.
During the 1/16 match of the Finals of the Cup of Russia with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved with a regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartacus fans had 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, according to an agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the KDK, Arthur Grigoryanz.
U.S. officials listen to Japanese officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of the U.S. intelligence services, who preferred not to disclose his name, said the U.S. was listening to the telephone conversations of high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points designed for hearing.
He noted that the United States, the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this was the case during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite the alliance relations with the Americans in the postwar period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK.
None of the parties have officially commented on this information yet.
The news about the U.S. intelligence surveillance of the German Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the ANB could have listened to Merkel’s phone over the past ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some data, perceived the news of his hearing very painfully.
She said that the allies, which she believes have been Germany and the United States for decades, such observation of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about Angela Merkel’s telephone conversations with German prosecutors.
The German specially arrived in Moscow to meet with a former CIA employee.
Baskyria may put grain on sale not before the beginning of 2014
Basque in the course of state procurement interventions can put grain on sale not earlier than the beginning of 2014, says Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
Currently, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
The price on the market is higher and there is demand.
“It is possible that the grain will be exhibited for sale after the New Year,” he said at a press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year the harvest of agricultural crops under the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
Under the 2014 harvest planted 550 thousand hectares (on 105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
Expanded areas under winter wheat and tricycles, the crops remained at the previous level.
There is no "Brother's Circle" group in the U.S. base of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the databases of the Russian forces of the "Brother Circle" group, to which Washington classified singer Grigory Leps, does not mean.
As "Interfax" noted in the law enforcement bodies of the Russian Federation, after the media appeared reports about the entry of the U.S. Ministry of Finance Grigory Leps into the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother Circle", all the databases were checked, but such grouping was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which is allegedly operating abroad, the force structures believe.
Even in the name 'Brother Circle', there is some element of mystery, there is an indication of the secret lounge.
“It’s all very similar to a pire action,” the agency’s spokesman said.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance announced on October 31 that it was included in its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother Circle" Artur Badalan, Grigory Lepsviridze, Vadim Lyanin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The persons listed on this list are suspected of relations with some of Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and are in the U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps "serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev."
In the producer center of Gregory Leps refused to comment on the U.S. accusations against the singer, calling them "bred".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama took the Brother's Circle syndicate to the "important transnational organized criminal groups" and commissioned the minfin "to suppress and prevent their global criminal operations."
The entry of a person in the black list of the American minfin leads to the blocking of his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with him by persons living in the United States.
Scandal video came to the police.
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, famous for his scandalous and honestly unrighteous outcomes, got on a crack smoking.
The police of the Canadian city said it has the corresponding video and is ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN.
The information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford’s drug use appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement authorities, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this issue.
Sheriff said he was not authorized to share the personal data with the public, but he was dismissed for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford-compromitting video was discovered during an anti-narcotic raid carried out by the guards around the summer of 2013.
Previously, the Canadian press has already written about the existence of this video, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor does not make any comments on this.
He just says he is not guilty of anything and is not going to resign.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of the 35-year-old friend of Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of light drug trafficking, harassment, obtaining illegal income, as well as criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisa served as the driver of Rob Ford.
The city residents have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly clashed with journalists, appeared in the public in a drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
OAO "Rostovaeroinvest" recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender on the selection of the object's general designer.
The amount of the contract in "Rostovaroinvest" is not revealed.
According to the press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, according to the tender conditions the project should be prepared and sent to the state expert in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and facilities of the airport complex.
At the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters, in the future it is possible to increase.
The project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025 the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
At the time of submission of the results of the tender was determined the architectural concept of the Southern air station complex, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal building implements the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in the implementation of large projects, the company has designed the C and E terminals of the Sheremetyevo International Airport and the new airport complex at the Knevici International Airport in Vladivostok.

Turkish politician declares hunger against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of a separation wall in the neighborhood of the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local inhabitants and representatives of the Prokurd Party of the PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city, Nusaybin Aisha Gekhan, on the border with Syria, announced a famine in protest against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
Police have repeatedly demonstrated.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammar Güler first denied the fact of the construction, then said the wall was built to ensure the security of the borders.
“Major Nusaibin Aisha Gekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle,” the party said in a press service.
The mayor believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, and the Kurds have crossed this border freely for half a century.
“This is an unhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree,” Aisha Gekhan said.
According to the press service, on November 7th, a demonstration against the construction of a split wall is planned in Nusabin.
Venezuela will set currency rates for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - Bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was by the Bloomberg agency on November 1, with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange in a year amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the Bolivar purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the Bolivar against the dollar will be set later.
In February, Karakas was forced to devaluate the local currency to 6.3 bolivar per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivar.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost 70 percent of its value.
In September, the inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Industry Minister and Vice President for Economy Rafael Ramires said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devaluate the bolivar.
According to the informal information brought by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of reducing prices for goods and goods of widespread consumption, as well as the high degree of stability of the Venezuelan economy have led to a number of goods deficit and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that in Venezuela there was a lack of toilet paper.
Director of Yugra Andrei Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new main coach.
This post became empty after Sergey Shepelev's resignation.
The withdrawal took place just a few hours ago, so to say how much time it will take to find a new coach, I’m not ready.
Maybe the day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
We don’t just want to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and get certain results with him.
Kenya press disagree with provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there is a reason for the question: what can prevent the destruction by Parliament of the independence of the judicial system in the future?", the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very strict and punitive, and we are rejecting it,” said Cyrus Kamou, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media judicial authority “will always be partial because it is a continuation of the government” and the content and advertising restrictions will harm the situation of Kenya in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to the parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new law in essence will allow the government to "take the media a dead catch," and The Standard that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "have got a serious blow," and criticized the bill as "drakonovsky."
The draft law is part of measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists in the Westgate shopping center.
Kenya’s media has raised the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras where troops sent to the site of the attack are supposed to steal a expensive shopping center.
The reaction of police chief David Kimayo was the call of two journalists and a media official to investigate, although the call was canceled after mass media protests.
According to the new law, publishers can be punished up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists - up to one million with the additional risk of being "excluded from the lists", i.e. getting a ban on receiving official journalist accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the infringer if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one penalty is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called “revived blogosphere” of Kenya.
The politicians understand that, forcing the media to silence, they will be able to do whatever they think, without punishment.
“No one will ever know,” writes Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, characterizing Kenya’s media as a key source of repressive and balancing forces in the public life.
“The politicians delivered to themselves will destroy the country and return us to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
The Kenyan legislators were the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the reductions appointed by the national salary commission, and the restoration of the size of their huge salary, which is about 532 thousand shillings per month, untaxable, one of the highest in the world.
In the communal payments of the warriors will appear a new line of expenditure - discounting for capital repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The rule will be determined by the Government of the region.
But when painting the entrance, ordering the staircase cells or even replacing the elevator - the residents will decide themselves.
This law was approved by the Deputies of the Regional Duma.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, it is also necessary to put the order - to establish the order of the caprymonture of houses, to accumulate the funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then elsewhere, it will be the establishment of state control over the spending of the funds that the inhabitants collect for the repairs of the multi-storey houses."
Under the control of the state is now the share construction.
The law that protects against fraudsters is approved by the ombudsman in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,5 thousand people have been affected by unfair builders.
The majority’s problems have been resolved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and duties for all participants in the share building.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, the chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is not a secret that in this sphere also have begun abuses associated with the fact that in the 98th year the dulls were the same, and in the 2000s the same dulls."
People began to make money on it to cover the slope, including, they adopted these two laws.
Under Voronezh is decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problem of illegal immigrants in the region should be removed.
Last year, more than 100 thousand foreigners entered the migration account.
But only one in five have formally issued a work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, the chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They have violated the legislation, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, but they must be deported - they must be held somewhere.
This decision was made by the Federation to equip such places with regional funds.
In the Voronezh region such a place is determined - it is Old Olshanka of the Semiluk region.
Well, and finally, the regional parliament granted new benefits to multiple parents.
First, families where they raise 5 or more children are completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same amount is saved by multi-child parents.
Second, and that’s the most important thing, those who adopt three or more babies will be granting housing subsidies from the new year.
For each member of the family the new law provides 18 square meters, at the price of 30 thousand per meter.
Family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, mother and third - adopted.
For them, according to the norms, the state acquires a housing area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left coast or the Southeast micro-region, it is quite acceptable option.
Well, and in the river center for this amount you can already buy a whole cottage.

U.S. Secretary of State: U.S. intelligence sometimes "goed too far" when gathering data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that the U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes "goed too far" when gathering data and hearing, but the politician noted that the information appearing in the media about 70 million people was not true.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was unlawful.
I recognize this, as the president also acknowledges... and we will take care that this does not happen in the future,” the spokesman said.
Italian workers with stages leave the way to young people
Italian unemployment is recording.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s residents are now unemployed.
So bad things have not happened since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of people aged 15 to 24 have no employment.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of elderly workers.
This experiment is already carried out by the country’s largest energy company, and the legislation enables the regional authorities to provide a part of the early retirement for employees with experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy is expecting a common problem for Europe for the ageing population.
And the economists are not sure that the backdrop with premature rotating of personnel justifies itself.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport and transit nodes (TPUs).
By 2020 it is planned to introduce 255 TPUs.
What the project is doing, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction plot occurred at the Metro "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The signature stated that the transport and transition nodes are being arranged.
All this was very strange, as near Smolensk no land transport stops and therefore it is not possible to move on.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including a ground passage through the Karmanic Crossing.
Now at Smolensk almost everything is over.
The flower lark disappeared, the stand for newspapers was dismantled, and the asphalt before the entrance was replaced with a brush.
Here is the entire transport hub.
Transport and transplant nodes are flat and capital, the press service of the capital transport department explains.
There is no capital TPU yet.
A flat includes the construction of parks, the removal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural shapes and the well-establishment.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even engaged by carriers, but by professional well-establishers from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport nodes are not necessarily a complex structure, says director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes there are enough roofs above the head and the board, indicating the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, the subway "Yasenovo" has recently opened a fully flat transit nod.
Let's be without wheels, but with overwhelming parks and a board indicating when the bus will come.
But in the pursuit of the number of officials record in the TPU everything that falls.
Also in 2011 the mayor planned to build on all about 151 nodes, of which 59 with capital construction.
There are now 255 TPUs in plans by 2020.
One and a half of them will be delivered this year.
Although there is a TPU development program in the city, no quality criteria is indicated, says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
It is by the number of objects, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: the first - reduction of the transplant time, the second - convenience.
First of all, the possibility of changing the type of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when the TPU is set up, it is sometimes the opposite.
A bright example of the metro “VDNH”.
Earlier, suburban buses from Yaroslavsky Highway came to the square before the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the street of the Cosmonauts.
Later than the metro, much further than the monorel, but closer to residential houses.
Thankfully, the inhabitants did not want a bus station under the windows and complained in all possible instances.
With the capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not happen immediately.
The first of them began to be built five years ago at the metro "Planerna".
The project was designed to be a sample.
And it really got an example of how the re-setting nodes given to investors are turning into a banal trading center.
No, there are perrons for buses, a curtain so that you don’t go from the metro under the rain, and three floors of car stations.
Truth, the Hymkin trolleybuses No202 and No203 in Moscow TPU places were not given in principle.
They were removed as strangers from the subway.
There are more places to trade.
One only clothes 32 stores, and in general there is almost everything - from the zoo to the autosalone.
Well, indeed, who of the bus passengers will suddenly need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, there is always a shopping center.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot has decided to go to the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planer" among the parking spaces placed on the floor is fighting trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guardians who look badly at our photographer.
The transplant nodes eventually turned into a basar.
The fact is that before the metro "Planerna" had a market, but it was removed.
And in the prefecture, the merchants complained and laid on the interceptive parking of a transplant nod.
Because of high prices there is always empty.
The most funny thing is that the market was shut down in order to build on its place... a new flat TPU.
This is rotating.
At the "Kalužskaya" subway, the distance of access from the subway to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trade center, alleged TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To sit in the bus, you need to pass through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, it must be surrounded under the open sky.
However, the designs on the "Planer" and "Kalužskaya" will soon be shown with flowers.
In mid-September, the city-building and land commission of the municipality approved the planning solutions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25 floors, without counting two or three underground rays.
The main monster will grow at the subway "Tushino", in which it will be 418,7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the RJD Railway Station Directorate, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the subway, have already told journalists: in the future multi-storey will be shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multiple parking areas will occupy one-third to half of the area.
Let’s take for example the “national” garages.
Let’s say, the garage on 258 car-place, which has recently been built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for the parking for 2,6 thousand cars at "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "quadrates".
This is less than a third of the machine they are going to build there.
Let one or two floors go on any bus routes.
There remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
For a minute, it is almost two GUMs.
If the capital TPUs at stations and stations build railways, the rest of the sites will be dealt with by the metropolitan.
They also promised that there will be a lot of “functional objects”, including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft decree, according to which investors will be able to apply for the receipt of the site for the TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Transportation is a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadaina station in Toronto, says Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybuses and tramways descend under the ground to the metro level and the distance of access from the metro wagon to the tram is only 50 meters without a way out.
There is no excess trade.
But the Moscow officials are thrown in extreme.
Or we’re not going to build anything, or we’re going to destroy 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Ezer proposes to equate to extremism the insult of patriotic feelings
For the legislative protection of the patriotic feelings of citizens from the provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Justice Russia" proposes to equate the insult of the patriotic feelings to extremist activities and punish five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy of the Duma Energy Committee, Oleg Micheev, are already sent to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Micheev points out, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for abuse of formal signals of state power - flag and herb.
At the same time, in the opinion of the parliamentary, the protection of the Russians, whose feelings can be overwhelmed by the insult of state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect to our country, in the Russian legislation has not worked enough.
As an example, he brings the developing discussions every year to the Canyon of Victory Day, when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic accomplishment of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on 9 May - a true vacancy is opened every year.
Practicing in wisdom and an “alternative view” of history, some publicists get to considerations about what, to say, it is a sad thing that cultural Germans have not conquered the wild Soviet Union!
I think this is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual firmness” of the nation,” says Oleg Mikheev.
Furthermore, according to Micheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but at the same time the law punishes for insulting the feelings of the believers, and insulting the patriotic feelings can be practically punishable.
In the opinion of the people elected, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriot feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe the corresponding punishment in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides a penalty for insulting patriot feelings: from a 100-thousand penalty to five-year imprisonment.
A 6.6 magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the district of the city of Kokimbo in the central part of Chile, Reuters.
The point of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, the U.S. Geological Service (USGS) website said.
The balls were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November by Moscow).
About the victims or the destruction caused by subterranean impulses is not yet.
Remember, Chile is located in one of the most seismic areas on Earth, so earthquakes of different strength there is not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
The earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused the deaths of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred in Chile: in 1960 there was recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
As a result of the natural disaster, more than 5,000 people were killed.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace will be treated fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the matter of Greenpeace activists will be considered strictly in accordance with Russian legislation.
France may not doubt that the trial will be carried out in accordance with the law, we hear all concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the laws,” Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the arrested Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanna, like the other activists, is charged with humiliation.
“I asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen,” Mr. Ero said.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws,” Dmitry Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the production of energy carriers, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "as a dust bottle" and reminded what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico.
United Nations announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately start working on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals that were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the CRT, which expires in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro last night.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit participants last night that it is now time to “stay above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the United Nations Member States have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating the Universal Sustainable Development Goals – the CUR,” he said.
These CURs will be based on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, they will become an integral part of the development concept for the period after 2015.
I will make every effort to use the powers granted to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of sustainable development objectives that are based on the successful implementation of the CRT.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing due to influential people's conflict
Under the statue of Samara Mashel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scand for peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want the return of peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business costume to a shirt decorated with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined a crowd on Thursday in the capital Square of Independence.
During two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between the government troops and Renamo were received — one of the most brutal clashes since the cessation of peace more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebellion movement, which was first supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the government of South Africa of the period of apartheid as part of the efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the coup in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to go back to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have forced foreign investors and local residents to be nervous.
The rates are high for a fast-growing economy as the opening of huge shelf gas and coal fields in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the U.S.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party accuse each other of the tensions that have emerged.
The RENAMO party claims that the government has become the founder of the last collisions by attacking its members in the province of Sophala, the traditional river of RENAMO, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then worsened when government troops attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill Aphonse Dhlakamu, the group’s leader, said to the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, a Renamo spokesman.
The government blames Renamo in initiating collisions, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebusa has tried to dissolve concerns about the instability.
Gebusa told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt “unfortunate” wanting to use “all that remains from his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns arose after the reports that Mazanga declared the rejection of Renamo from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant the failure to comply with the agreement by the freelance party.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all the seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties did little to relieve the tensions that increased a series of collisions this year.
“These are two influential people (Hebuz and Dhlakama) that met with their heads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a Mozambique expert.
No one of them is a good negotiator and no one of them is ready to go on the necessary departure.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt of the weakened movement to get downs and financial bonuses from the government.
The proportion of votes for Renamo has decreased since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its figures in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga says Mr. Hebuza, who is to leave the post next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what possibilities Renault has, but it has already committed devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway leading from north to south.
The majority of the clashes took place in the province of Sophala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beirut, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was disappointed when he was asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
“Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going very well,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the government’s dissatisfaction, and many people are also worried about corruption, slow pace and recent kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the country’s future is the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultan, a demonstrator, said that people just want stability.
“No one is concerned about neither Renamo nor Freemoto, they just want the restoration of the world, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
The series of art-mainstream film premiere will take place in Moscow
The series of art-mainstream films, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their lease, will take place in the Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, RIA News reports with reference to the project organizers.
It will open the art-mainstream program by the French comedy director and actress Ray Kerichi "Paris at any price".
This is the story of the working in the French capital model May (Sama Kerichi), who is deported to his homeland - to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the Kerichi film, the audience will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duka "Mebius", the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: Love Story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of May Cannes Film Festival "Life of Adel" Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian participant of "Art-meinstream" will be the winner at the festival "Kinotaver" film of Alexander Veldinsky "Geograph globus propil" on the motives of the same-name novel of Aleksei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming failure teacher Viktor Служкин - in the film played Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also marked with the "KinoTavour" award.
Children should study myths and legends as “the lifestyle patterns,” says the author.
Stories about Tora could show that “a brutal force cannot overcome the subtle wisdom,” and the legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Speaking that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too inappropriate for teaching in schools,” Krossley-Holland stands for a “custom selection” of age-friendly texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I supported the introduction of them into the training program for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “rejectes interest” in children, and the basic ideas are “sublimated” into exciting stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote a collection of Norwegian Myths for Penguin and British People's Tales, said: "You may have intentions, of course, but you're better to keep them with you."
Per a big difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an adult writer who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
It is not that everything needs to be simplified or to lead to a happy end, but it is necessary that there is a genuine understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle is to show, not to tell.
In Voronezh region arrested a football fan who broke the window in the waiting room of the station
At nine a.m. on October 29 at the station of Grezy-Voronezh, transport police staff removed from the passenger train two football fans - the descendants of the Moscow region.
After going to the game of the favourite team, the guys on the way arranged a drunk deboch in the train.
The young people were delivered to the service part of the linear police department at the Greasi station to prepare a protocol on an administrative offence.
The fans disappointed in their anti-social behavior.
The police issued administrative documents and released them.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the entrance door in the waiting room of the station.
On the bell of the broken glass runned a police officer and a guard of the CHOP "RŽD".
They managed to arrest the criminal who tried to escape from the scene.
The employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs are conducting inspection.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case is being resolved, the senior referent of the direction of information and public relations of the Southeast LU of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Olhovik said.
Vitaly Mutko: The Waterman?
I think we have returned 15 years ago.
Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the disturbances at the tribunes during the match of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am a supporter of the responsibility of the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They wait for someone to come from the side and make the order.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
You have to organize fans, the clubs have to invite their stewards, not to leave the matter on a self-take.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of behavior in the stadiums.
Once it is accepted, we will deal closely with this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read the interview of Leonid Fedun.
The state, please, give the law faster.
Such a feeling that it is the fans of "Bavaria" to Yaroslavl came and all this arranged.
We are external observers.
And in general, it's terrible - to see how the tribune is swallowed from the brandspot.
It is in the country that is preparing for the world championship.
“I feel like we’ve returned 10-15 years ago,” Muttko said.
Snowden can be interviewed in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden is likely not to leave Russia to give testimony in cases of hearing the German chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone talks.
As a source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday, an American may answer questions from the representatives of the German Prosecutor's Office in writing or eye in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he will lose the status of a refugee and may be extradited to Washington by the U.S. allies," the agency spokesman said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor's Office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or send written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this question should be processed on the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strabbele that Edward Snowden was ready to give testimony in the case of the U.S. intelligence ministry’s hearing of Germany’s chancellor’s talks.
Snowden is ready to give testimony to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The former CIA employee made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But for this, it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival," Strébelle told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on an Interfax source's statement, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide himself.
Edward Snowden, a US citizen who worked for the National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he disclosed information about the secret operations of the U.S. intelligence services on the internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow by transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities, which were ongoing to him serious accusations, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum on the territory of Russia for a period of a year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, the American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client was prepared to work in a "great Russian company".
The surveillance of Angela Merkel was by the German media last week.
According to journalists, the telephone talks of Chancellor began to be heard by the Americans in 2002.
The tracking station wasly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
After the publication of this information, the German authorities said that Merkel’s surveillance violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev leaves 'Justice Russia'
The Deputy of the State Duma from the party "Justice Russia", member of its department in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev submitted a declaration of withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentary said, the statement he submitted to the new Siberian regional party department.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left a series of "justices".
We sit down and drink tea.
"There's a lot of people want to see the picture "Illya Ponomarev puts a ticket on the table," but there's nothing so epochal," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that heins good relations with the regional department of the "esers".
Meanwhile, State Duma deputy Ilya Ponomarev has no intention to refuse.
He explained that, despite the departure, he remains a member of the party and according to the law cannot leave it.
The announcement of the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the "Justice Russia" party appeared on October 30.
It was that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov will come out with him from the "SR", but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan to discuss peace treaty with Russia
The head of Japan’s Foreign Affairs Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"They would want to openly exchange opinions on the issues of further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kishid said at the meeting.
Japan's Foreign Minister recalled that after Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, the relations between the countries became warmer and acquired bilateral character.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a resolution of the issue of the controversial Northern Territories.
In connection with this, protests are taking place in Tokyo today with the demand to return the land lost after World War II.
In the Japanese capital, cars run from which a loud speaker says, “Return the northern territories!”
Police do not stop the protesters, they are monitoring so that noise levels are not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival
It can be boldly claimed that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the extravagant artist Frank Fey, who worked a conference at the Palace Theatre at Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversationary manner.
Fae's innovation has been captured by others, very recently - the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hersch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headlines started at Carolines, and then achieved more success, reached a level when they’re already too famous to play in the club,” Hersch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year the event includes performances of Wanda Sax, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as "Standap for Heroes" - an annual musical and comedy charitable concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springstein, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will appear among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy was expanding.
A number of comics participating in the festival this year gained popularity in a non-traditional way, for example by showing on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous because of his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable television channel (such as the FXX "Liga" on the theme of fantasy football), and now leads his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the acting composition both in "Saturday Evening in Live" and in "Parks and Recreation Zones", although she is most well known for the series of viral films "Marcel - a puppy in shoes".
Both Croll and Slate, like other young comedians with an authentic style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, crazy, focused on the race theme of Kamou Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg’s interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and cinema, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was a leading show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“This city is the central element of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked on some street between the two houses and thought, “Hey, if I stay completely free of money, I’ll probably live here.”
Pakistani authorities start talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have started talks with the Taliban.
This was by the country’s embassy in the UK, where Pakistan’s Prime Minister Navaz Sharif is visiting.
The head of the Pakistani government made a statement about talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-President Nick Klegg, with whom he discussed the issues of Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The prime minister that the dialogue with the Taliban movement has begun,” the Pakistani Embassy in London said in a statement.
“He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue works in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same-name Afghan movement, but act independently from it in the northwestern areas of the country border with Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are seeking the creation of the Islamic State.
Earlier, the Islamabad government tried to begin talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to negotiate.
It said it will go to negotiations only if the authorities bring to the places of permanent displacement of troops placed in the areas where the Taliban operate, and also release the detained Islamists from prison.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, UK Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a three-party meeting in London to discuss the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
The price of oil fell to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large reserves shut down the message that shows that China’s energy-intensive production sector is getting stronger.
The U.S. oil range in December supply decreased by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel in the late morning at European time at the e-shop at the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract decreased by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in the price for October by 5.8 percent.
The rich oil reserves have influenced its price over the past few weeks.
The Ministry of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. reserves increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, the stock has been filled by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports on the Chinese industry, demonstrating the explosion of its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of China’s economy may continue to gain strength after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 percent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, a reference sort of international oil, also used by U.S. oil processing companies, dropped by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The chief coach of Colorado, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes in the Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the last night behind the grid did not undermine his confidence in the Russians, reports Dallas' S.E. scorpion Natalia Schmelova.
And what we’re waiting for, – said Rua after the morning break “Lavin”.
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in it and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
That is, you are completely sure that the situation has not affected the condition of the gateway?
Here we will see today.
Without a doubt, our players will support Warley by helping him protect the gate, as it was in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
In Siberia, you shouldn’t be a vegan: green tomato will not replace the soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti explained.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they can’t survive the winter without losses for health, and no thermal tomatoes will compensate them, the new-Siberian dietologists and doctors consider surveyed on the eve of the vegan day.
Drink oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when weaken not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietologists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, following such strict nutritional norms is at least not beneficial for health.
Complete abandonment of animal foods is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate by vegetables.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," said the nutritionist Marina Bogay.
It is a fish that contains essential omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest plant oil is linen.
"To consume it in the amounts necessary for a person, you need to drink in liters!" says the dietologist.
Doctors are convinced that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is questioned.
In our realities there are high food requirements.
To avoid freezing, you need a high calorie.
"If a person restricts himself to animal foods, accordingly, this calorie he does not receive," the specialist says.
This is stated by the dietologist Olga Poznak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not a way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is tailored to the best absorption and digestion of these products.
And in the winter, people want not a garlic to crush, but a hot soup or something more saturated," the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, different grapes, grapes, beans, local vegetables, apples, which remain in the winter, frozen fruits are truly useful.
But this is clearly not enough for full nutrition.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the levels of vitamins in the body of Siberians are sufficient only from the middle of August to the middle of September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow lies, is unsuitable.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, above all, fat,” the doctor says.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including in the form of amino acids.
And following vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and microelements in the menu.
“The vegans do not receive them,” Godai is sure.
Arifulina says that an adult is willing to choose anything, "play the toys he wants."
He has a already formed body, skeleton, organs.
The children should eat fully.
If parents deprive him of any microelements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be recovered tomorrow," she says.
All the surveyed medical specialists agree on the low quality of the winter crops in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in the greenhouses contains a smaller amount of minerals we need than (grown) in the open soil.
“The quality of the food is not that,” Godai says.
Arifulina also notes that imported and thermal vegetables and fruits are far from the ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to collect greater harvest is harmful to quality.
“The apples don’t become brown on the scratch, the garlics quickly get yellow and blurred, the tomatoes are flavourless and unaromatic,” the doctor tells examples, adding that they are likely to be drunk with excess fertilizers.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
This does not agree with the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agricultural Problems, candidate for agricultural sciences Vera Petrouk.
It says that with the correct approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in the heater, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If you try to extinguish more than a square meter, then, of course, the water will become more frequent, and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large but waterproof and unsweet," she explains, adding that the question of quality, first and foremost, depends on the consciousness of the manufacturer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-stop” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court suspended the execution of a court ruling requiring changes to the New York Police Department’s “stop-and-stop” program, and removed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States said that the execution of the judge Shira Sheindlin's rulings will be suspended until the results of the appeal submitted by the city were received.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it performed the street arrest and interrogation program.
The city filed a complaint on its decision and decrees on corrective measures, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police department change the practice of work and the related training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the appeals of the parties on the request for the suspension of the case.
The Court of Appeal said it was necessary to withdraw a judge because it violated the U.S. judges’ code of conduct and did not count on the need to avoid a demonstration of prejudice, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court’s criticism.
The court ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unjustifiedly addressing the black and Latin Americans under the “stop-and-stop” program.
She has appointed an external controller to monitor the large-scale changes that include policy, training and control reforms, and has decided to launch a pilot program to test the body-covered video cameras in the police stations where the majority of arrestations are occurring.
In August, New York decided to cease the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were ceased after police inspection.
Appeals to the city must take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of “stop and search” was criticized by a number of civil rights lawyers.
The “stop-to-stop” has been practiced for several decades in some form, but the number of documented stops has dramatically increased under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching a 2011 absolute record of 684,330, most of which are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, submitted a collective lawsuit to the court.
Defenders of the “stop-and-stop” program at the New York Police Department say that these changes will end unfair practice, create a more reliable and efficient police service and can affect how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will lower the battle spirit of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary money spending and will not solve the more global problem of complicated conditions in the police due to the decrease of the number of officers by several thousand in the last decade.
The court noted that it does not cease the practice of “stop-and-stop,” which is in accordance with the constitution, but changes the way the New York police stops people.
In the district of Tretyakovskaya Gallery opened a pedestrian area
A new pedestrian area has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the district of the Treatyakov Gallery and occupies a area of two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to the Bolt Square.
Over all the way, street torchers, flower houses, shelves, urns and toilets are installed, dirty barriers and illegal advertising are removed.
In addition to the Klimentsky and Lavrushinsky crossroads, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for the cars - the Ordinsky Tupik, the Great and Small Tolmachevsky crossroads, the Kadasheva coastline and the Bolot Square.
The traffic on the streets of Morseyk and Petrovka is not limited.
On the part of the Friday Street from the vestibule of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to the Klimentskij preulk the conditions for pedestrians created without removing the movement and cutting the passing part, newsmsk.com reports.
Inside the pedestrian area were the Tretiakov Gallery, the temple of the priest Clement of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, the full pedestrian stations were the Tverskaya Passage, the Stoleshnikov Passage and the Kuznetsky Bridge Street.
The Great Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian area opened in early September, is decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson applied to a phone hack to check a confidential message
News of the World’s former editor, Andy Coulson, allegedly used “telephone, surveillance and opposition” in an attempt to confirm the false information about the novel of Charles Clark, who was at the time the Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, the royal lawyer Andrew Edis, told the Old Bayley court that in May 2005, the News of the World received an unreliable news that Clark was meeting with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Polly.
The newspaper ordered the private detective Glenn Mulkier to break the voice mail of Paulby and warned her at home to take an interview, but Colson also called her and left the voice messages, the court heard.
“The accusation believes that Mr. Colson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not such a person who will stand next to someone’s home hoping to get someone shocked, he is a person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they’re saying,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the newspaper News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: telephone hacking, monitoring, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he just ought.
What about the first?
Do you know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, “Oh, yes!”
The rumors about Clark’s novel first attracted the attention of News of the World, when a source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polly, said, “Don’t waste time, she is with Charles.”
The cassette with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was removed from the house of Mulker in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Mrs. Paulby and her sister were figuring as "Projects".
During the period she was under surveillance, Mrs. Paulby's grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbek and former reporter James Weserap were monitoring Mrs. Paulby's movements.
Leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Colson said, “I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said Colson's participation in this story took place in the same scenario as with other influential people, for example with former Interior Minister David Blankett.
The prisoners heard on Thursday that Coulson came into confrontation with Mr. Blanket about the novel with a married woman while he himself met with the correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was at the time married.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to engage in conspiracy with other people for the purpose of hacking their phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkier, Turlbek and Weserap acknowledged their phone hacking.
Snowden says he is prepared to talk to the German authorities on the issue of hearing
Former CIA employee Edward Snowden expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities.
The letter of the former CIA officer to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by the Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strabbele, through which Snowden transmitted the message to the German authorities.
Strebels met with Snowden in Moscow last night.
In the fire on the street, four people were injured.
As a result of a fire in a collector in the center of Moscow, on the Tversky Street, four passengers were injured.
According to the news agency Interfax, with reference to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, passengers who were in the fire were injured in the underground passage.
As RIA Novosti writes with reference to the head of the capital department of fuel and energy economy Pavel Livinsky, now all houses on the Tversky Street fully restored electricity.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tverska Street occurred in the evening of October 31.
A strong smoke went out of the lows of the water supply, and in the underground passage, located near the store "Armenia", a damp was formed.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverska Street were destroyed.
At 21:45 Moscow time the fire was eliminated.
U.S. to cut food aid for poor people
The food supply for a family of four people is reduced by $36 a month
From Friday in the U.S. the financial security of the foodstemps, known as foodstemps, is reduced as the action of the relevant state program is over.
The four-person family will now spend $36 a month less on food benefits than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million poor Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 financial year, one-person aid was an average of $133 a month.
Food aid expenditure in the U.S. increased to $80 billion a year due to unemployment growth and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on the free food aid issued by foodstips, which have been named since the previous times when they had the form of paper coups.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress call for further reduction of the funds allocated to the programme, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Food stores in all over the United States are concerned that cuts will lead to a decrease in consumer costs.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform for free
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform for PC for free.
This is by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net in the classical Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers note that at the moment it can download only those users whose accounts belong to the U.S. part of the service.
The game is not available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC does not look different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events evolved on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king Vlaros and become the single ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight the Sarraq's fighters and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the studio released after its translation into Blizzard Entertainment.
It was known as Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow metropolitan.
But selling tickets to passengers they will not be for money, but for seats.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of sessions will be counted by a special device using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first apparatus will be installed at the "Exhibition" station on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of new ticket sports will receive the president of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and the Olympic champions gymnastics Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
Recognitions of the National Security Agency strengthen the paranoia of corporations with regard to state surveillance
In a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew down over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the internal intelligence service of Germany, his task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. representation building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
German media says BfV hoped to find the antenna of the hearing devices, and these actions triggered negotiations between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of the U.S. National Intelligence, said in September that the U.S. does not use external intelligence capabilities “to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interest of U.S. companies, to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contractual servant who became a discloser, began to publish his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted.
The reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations caused by the state’s eye to new heights.
The last drop was the news that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel was heard,, for about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, the potential targets are business leaders.
Snowden revealed intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it is quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Groen, chairman of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial spy and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, there was still no evidence that the United States had transmitted the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
The politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain information technology and internet capabilities, and said it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about it.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, chairman of the German software supplier for SAP’s business.
If there is a need in a powerful European IT industry, it was not worth allowing it to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. spy agencies, which became famous for Snowden’s revelations, was a shock for some companies who previously thought that China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A big shift occurs in cloud technologies, where European companies’ leaders have better realized that the data stored in the U.S. is within the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American participants refused to plan to use the services of a U.S. cloud provider after the U.S. Intellectual Data Analysis Program Prism was unveiled.
Jim Snape, one of SAP’s executive directors, said: “We see consumers ask a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest messages are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore, these data should be protected at any cost.
What economic espionage is happening is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed substantially in the current polemics,” says Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Officer of BASF Chemical Company.
The Americans are spying for us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying for them as it is in our national interests – to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually don’t like to boast the responsive measures they’ve taken, as this can give an advantage to the opponent.
In large companies, it has long been adopted the idea that taking a free flash at the exhibition or leaving a laptop without supervision in the hotel room is at least invisible.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automotive company Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for many years – to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as hearing devices.
The Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that corporate leaders consider the possibility of using simple prepaid mobile phones while traveling abroad due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are later removed.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies are still vulnerable to fractures and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are the leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. national intelligence report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second series of hackers, after China, the Washington Post says.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are worse of all.”
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The agencies know that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying for their allies.”
The parents of a teenage man from Georgia, who died by a "smallful accident", believe their son was killed.
The parents of a teenage man from Georgia, whose body was found inside a swallowed sports mat in the gym of his high school, believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdost, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing matte placed behind the tribunes in the gym of his high school.
Investigators of the Loundes County Sheriff's management have concluded that Johnson died by a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family complains it.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was killed,” said Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he was dead as the sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and the common sense,” Trump said.
They think it’s a cover to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag and returned him to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation of Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday.
I will study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
"I adhere to the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the primary revelation showed that Johnson died as a result of a “positive asphyxia.”
However, the second revelation, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are a few questions to be solved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to carry out it.
A representative of the management of the Sheriff County of Loundes was not available to comment when he was addressed on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to publish all the videos of the observation cameras that the investigators watched.
The teenage parents said they hope that the videos contain the key to revealing how he died.
"Spartak": For information about the persons who hang out the fascist symbol
On the official website "Spartak" appeared a statement of the Moscow club about the appearance on the tribune in Yaroslavl of the fascist flag.
"On the Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak" on October 30 unknown provocators at the stadium in Yaroslavl showed a fascist symbol.
We call to all who have reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offence, with the request to provide it.
“The remuneration is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for fans who hang out the fascist flag in Yaroslavl.
Remember that in the match 1/16 of the final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" several times was interrupted due to disorders on the tribunes.
Furthermore, the fascist symbolism was demonstrated in the Spartak fan sector.
In the form of punishment, Spartak can play about three matches without spectators.
The committee meeting will be held on Friday.
If you have information about who carved and hanged this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations that the U.S. government has issued, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
At present, one in 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide contains information for schools about how to raise the awareness of teachers and service staff about food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline reserves – most often the automatic medical spray EpiPen is used for injections – to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State lawmakers have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline reserves with less difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “this feeling as if something touches my tongue,” “this feeling that I have hair on my tongue,” or “the tongue of the scratch.”
Intersex parents can choose ‘uncertain sex’
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third gender in children born with external genital organs of the intermediate type.
The newborn will no longer be obliged to attribute male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as "uncertain" or "uncertain" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who could make urgent decisions on the gender assignment operation to newborns, and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I’m going to remain a doctor-created lusted product with shrimp and shrimp.
Approximately one in two thousand children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed with "sexual development disorder" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonades (eagles or seeds) or unusually developed external genital organs.
Wallis Simpson was probably an intersex.
Gender identification is still not sufficiently studied, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be identified, it is better to take advantage of all the available information and assign it than to wait and track the child's psychological and physical development before surgery, if it happens at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Dresher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign the sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this happens.
This is like a mystery about why people are gay.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender, as their state is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female gender, but typically to both at the same time or is not characteristic to any of them.
These characteristics may manifest in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, breast and bodybuilding; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gives a general view of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people face in the field of employment, as well as the level of intimidation, cruelty and crime on the ground of prejudice.
Boys with gender deviations now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian Norry May-Welby became the first man in the world to be recognised as “unsexual,” defending in court the right to preserve “uncertain” sexual status for a lifetime.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports will be used a third indication in addition to M and F-X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still causing contradictions, according to a news release on channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this brilliant Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is trapped into a new state, where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning another two pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to give children gender at birth.
“To raise a child is hard enough and without any additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called hermafrodites — by the name of a beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both gender.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which everything can be deleted and then painted again.
But now many argue the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called an emergency psychiatric incident,” Dressher said.
When such children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist – you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with middle-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Manny from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily subject to change.
He introduced the term ‘gender identity’ and claimed that environmental signals, including social — the way parents grow the child — interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person will consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as “John/John”, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during negligent cutting, to completely cast the child, removing also his ovaries, and to grow him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not the case,” Dressher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38 he committed suicide.
Dresher said that some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, people who survived these gender change operations declared themselves “unhappy with the result.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes, but genitals of the intermediate type.
Doctors were unable to determine exactly whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a man’s “full life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, the outer genital and ovaries of Bruce were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given a vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he required medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Knowing the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone injections and removed his chest.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he acts in the defense of others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Anne Themer-Mattis, the executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “inspires to sticking labels and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and give the child an ‘uncertain sex’,” she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.
We think it’s better to attract male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is to build assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law, as "it allows adults to make choices in favor of the third sex."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexuality,” she says.
The German law implies it to be assigned at birth.
This is a battle that small children should not enter in this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Baratz, a mammologist-röntgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law will “support” both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called "the syndrome of full sensitivity to androgens."
Since her androgen receptors work incorrectly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but has no uterus and ovaries.
At the age of 29, Katie is married and is graduated in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate maternity.
“The law gives parents time not to make urgent decisions by themselves,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some analyses and understand the situation, as well as the interval of time before they write “man” or “woman”.
In this case, you’re okay – raise your child, you love the child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We don’t need to make an operation that is irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that motivates parents because they don’t feel they’re doing right,” she said.
At the end, the child will decide with which sex it is more comfortable for him or her, and that’s wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make decisions on their own.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin emphasized: he understands that he should play better.
The 40-year-old Russians said he would continue to work hard on training.
In the last two matches of Yastrebs, Habibulin first missed six shakes from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed shake.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed to do so, - CSNChicago quotes Habibulin's words.
I need to find confidence in the training, probably it is worth approaching them as to the games, and trying to get the best outcome.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but at training I feel quite good.
But somehow, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snow.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The players – I don’t think I’m the only one – always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I’m not excited.
It doesn’t matter what’s going on in front of my doors.
I’m still working on myself so that I don’t miss so many shakes.
It’s good that my single clubs support, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But it happened what happened.
I have to postpone it to the side.
I’m going to try to play the next match better.

Medvedev expects that the SSJ-100 will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after establishment on the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 will be delivered to Europe.
"We are expecting that in total we will get such agreements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian government noted that a serious cooperation with French colleagues is established, as it is a joint project.
Today we have discussed some financial issues that are related to insurance, but we hope that after this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
“I hope that one day it will be delivered to France,” the Russian Prime Minister said.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the company "Civil Aircraft of Sohogo" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The linear is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
The Dnipropetrovsky Energy Group has launched a unique program to rescue the Aist Nest.
In ancient times, to bring to the yard of the Aists, the peasants on a high column set a wheel from the telga, and a heavy nest was well kept on it.
Such special supports have long not been placed, so the Aists loved the stairs of the transmission lines - the interconnected branches rely on the pipeline, thus the Aistine house is reliable.
Grandmother Anya, near the house of which in the village of Ivanovka Petrokovsky region a true family has lived for twenty years, began to notice how the nest is sitting, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds put new wheels above, and the lower layer has already passed between the pipelines, and it will collapse.
Of course, it’s unfortunate for the family of the Aists, who each year nested at the basement, brought out and fed for the summer three or four birds, but they don’t want to stay without the light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm countryside, grandmother Anya called the Tsarichansky RES, which belongs to the support.
I didn’t even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still holding, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were found, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150-200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time the birds could die from electrical loading.
Also, local residents were at risk of staying without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, the linear monters started an operation to rescue the nest, and this is not the first time in our practice.
Scientists and ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest, helped.
They also conducted training for local network staff.
Famous Dnipropetrovsky ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energyists at all stages of the reconstruction of the nest.
For the beginning, it was estimated that in the area in emergency there are more than 50 real "habitants".
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were cooked, resembling a curtain.
The foundation was overwhelmed with ivory branches, and then the old nest was transferred there.
According to the scientists, it is enough to put the old branches as the foundation so that the birds know the nest and return to it.
After that, the Aids will build their own home.
A month ago, the first Nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschenko Novoskovsky district.
Near the electropore, a new iron concrete column was placed and a platform with a old, already lived nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost the energy in nine thousand rupees.
And in the days the same new village took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrokovsky district on the suburbs of grandmother Annie.
Here the platform was fixed on the previous place, only lifted above the pipelines.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone capital repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected for four more nests in the Pokrovsk and Tsarichan districts of Dnepropetrovskina.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them irresistibly.
On days, the entire area was overwhelmed by a sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for phasans, braconers for entertainment shoot the leved family, who lived on the local rainforest.
Noble birds didn't fear people at all - the locals fed them and didn't offend them.
When the farmers, after hearing the shootings, fled to the bar, four beautiful leopards were already lying on the water dead.
The staff of the Apostolic district department of the police are now finding out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The Russian March is becoming more popular.
On November 4, the Day of People's Unity will be held in Moscow in accordance with the mayor's "Russian March".
According to the Levada Center survey, the support of the “Russian March” is growing – already 40% of citizens in a different degree approve the idea of their conduct.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens in a different degree approve the "Russian March": 11% of them refer to such actions definitely positive and 29% - "fastly positive".
The popularity of the "Russian March" idea is gradually growing - in 2006 these actions were welcomed by only 14% of the Russians, and in December 2010 the conduct of such events was supported by more than twice the number of citizens (28%).
“Considerably negative” to “Russian marches” belong only 7% of Russians, “fast negative” – 19%.
Another 35% were unable to formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the mayor of Moscow agreed to carry out the "Russian March" with a number of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital, Aleksei Majorov, said today.
This nationalist campaign has been held every year on the Day of People's Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, “Do you have heard of the fact that “Russian marches” are held in Russia on November 4 under the slogans of defending the rights of the Russians in Russia?” three-quarters (75%) of citizens answered negative.
At present, only one in five Russians (20%) know about this share.
It is noted that in December 2010 about the "Russian March" a third of the citizens were heard (31%).
Remember that three years ago, on December 11th, a natural nationalist demonstration took place on the Manezh Square, which broke into mass disorders.
The Levada Center also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who know the right answer (People’s Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
Only 15 percent of citizens are gathered to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same (17%) intend to celebrate the October Revolution Day on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
The Moscow mayor agreed on the "Russian March" in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was by the leader of the association "Russian", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Lublin on the Day of People's Unity, a demonstration and rock concert of the group "Kolovrat" will be held, also agreed with the authorities.
The “Russian March 2012”
On the Day of People's Unity in 2012, the nationalists passed a walk from the Yakiman coast to the Central House of the Artist, where a demonstration took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to 20 thousand people, the IMD called the number 6 thousand.
Obama's presidential headquarters was considering Biden's exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest counselors were secretly considering the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton’s 2012 election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation from all of Mark Galperin and John Haylemann’s expected book on the 2012 campaign “Double Betting: The Game Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book preparing for the release and on Thursday evening that the nearest presidential assistants conducted “scale focus groups and public opinion surveys at the end of 2011” to evaluate whether Biden’s exclusion could help raise the exhausting hopes of Obama’s re-election.
According to the Political Observer The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt of high-ranking officials of the presidential staff and the White House, namely former White House administration chief Bill Daley, to assess what effect would have on the vote of the appointment of former Secretary Clinton as Vice President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicago presidential headquarters and the Oval Cabinet.
Only six closest presidential counselors – including Daley, former Obama presidential head Jim Messin and former White House senior counselors David Axelrod and David Pluff – knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book “Double Suggestions” claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their “near personal relations,” but eventually gave up this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not “successfully improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was actually considering the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
“I was actively supporting the consideration of a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You should remember that at that moment the president was in terrible shape, so we thought, “Oh God, what do we do?”
While Daley described the study as a “necessary check”, Martin told CNN spokesman Anderson Cooper that the pre-election headquarters has invested enough in investigating whether this step will bring dividends to the vote.
“The presidential staff will not spend such amounts of money on surveys and focus groups unless they take something seriously,” Martin said in the AC 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible transfer.
While Daley said he didn’t think that the president “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that, “possible,” Obama knew.
Martin added that the "Double Stakes" does not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political survey came to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believes that Obama did not know about the investigation of the possibility of excluding Biden from the electoral list.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a bright ice cream in the dark?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first lighting in the dark ice cream using medusa.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the sea animal to develop bright food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article about the medusa, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the bright protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the one who eats it, increasing the pH levels in the protein and making it shine.
Chris says that as ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you slide, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream production company "Lizze me, I'm delicious," says: "This is an incredible thing, but it's still in the very early stage, if we're talking about production, so for £200 you get about 2 g of the substance."
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue with a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth heats the protein, it will raise the pH and the ice cream will begin to shine.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seemed to be ideal to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful bright effect.
This is the most expensive ice cream I’ve done because the luminosity of medusa is four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball costs me about £140.
It is quite pleasant to taste.
The Charlie experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and the flavour of sandy gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop the invisible ice cream.”
This is defined impossible because of the breakdown caused by the ice crystals that make up ice, but I think we will find a way to do so.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists
The "Avangarda" coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular KHL championship against "Salawat", noted that the omichi carried out a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metalurg".
The expert emphasized that "Avangard" needs to pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against the Magnitogorsk "Metalurg", - said the official website of "Avangarda" the words of Chebaturkin.
I missed a lot of shakes, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of failure to perform the game task.
We knew that the rival had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks from the course - three shakes killed us.
Very good implementation.
Have these errors been taken into account when preparing for today’s game?
We and the boys look at each match carefully, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is performed.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against "Metalurg".
The game was completed and the score was 2-0.
They missed the goal "in the suitcase" - and in the third period they began to make a mistake.
Given the hardness of the game, he didn’t see any sense in connecting the defenders.
We need to defend the whole team.
Now the Avangard has a long home series, the matches go after a day - the team is tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and perform the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is solved not so difficult.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, there are hundreds of pounds on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and to install bio-toalets
In the border points at the entrance to Russia, hundreds of fur were accumulated.
This is due to changes in the customs regulations.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm: the line is created by the Russian side, which has not warned about the innovations in advance.
Since October 28, the customs authorities of Russia have begun to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, the deputy chief of the Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov said.
The new sample document applies to countries that have joined the Convention on International Transportation.
The gap points work in an enhanced mode.
The "FACTOV" correspondent visited the border and communicated with the remote strangers who were hostages of the situation.
The prices in the road shop-cafe at the passage point "Novoazovsk" rise with each day, as well as the turn from the fur.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometers.
The Customs Terminal Novozovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport directions from the south of Ukraine through the international highway.
From here the goods are sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight they were still released, and then these rules were introduced, — complains the long-riding Aleksei Golovanev (in the photo), who carries through Russia goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been almost a week night in his car.
According to the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
The minimum insurance is 4.5–5 thousand rubles (about 1100–1300 rubles).
Those who go nearby (think, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles ($3800) and go.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has such a lot of money with him!
Imagine, if a driver carries a cargo of just four thousand dollars, but up to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (about 23 thousand rubles) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival on the border - no, - are set by the long-borderers, who are arranged to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have never met anywhere!
The sellers co-oriented and quickly wrapped them: 15 rubles worth a bottle, seven rubles worth a cup of coffee, 25 rubles worth a plate of soup.
The coffee is alone.
There is no toilet.
We sleep in the steep, we go to the toilet.
Not to wash, not to care.
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife has prepared everything on the road.
A week long, - comforts himself another long-range Victor Scotarenko.
Will I get to my car in a week?
Why do you have a liter and a half of water? - we are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 rubles.
What, a bottle of crystal or water insists on silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take as long as there is something else, the seller parishes.
After the situation began to be revealed in the media, the emergency situation of Ukrainian drivers was addressed by the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosievsk and Novozovsk district administrations received the order to provide all those who strike in the row on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, said the chairman of the Donetsk district administrations Sergey Dergunov.
Emergency brigades are currently operating in the missing points.
Biological toilets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the issue related to the orders will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Oblast Administration, as of 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles were placed in the Uspenka and Novozovsk international passing points, respectively.
Facts will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspect Moscow of attempting to deceive the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against the high-ranking persons of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership - such a statement to the agency BNS made in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the statement, in particular, Moscow is going to “speak” the President of Lithuania Dali Grybauskait and publish the falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarchiv, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is conducted by the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania several times and participated in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also the participant of the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov, covered by scientific work until the end of 2012, regularly arrived in Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now banned from entering the country.
Last night, the President of Lithuania, Grybauskaitya, said he knew about the information tank that was preparing on it.
According to her, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and "the country's aspiration to energy independence".
The Lithuanian leader has not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She said that in the Kremlin, Lithuania is "not respectful enough".
In addition, Grybauskaitze accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of making "one only demands" to Lithuania.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended imports of the Lithuanian "mollock" to Russia.
It was that the quality of the products does not comply with the sanitary and epidemiological standards.
The Lithuanian leader then said that if Russia does not remove the ban, the country’s government must prepare for a call to the WTO.
In the U.S. the director of the school shoot a teenager.
The director of one of the American high school teenage literally led to disappointment.
The man, according to him, was forced to take the weapon and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, the young humilians shattered the man’s house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the director of the school opened a shooting on teenagers, resulting in several injuries in the leg and hand received a 15-year-old boy.
Since the humilians were not in the territory of the director's ownership, he was charged with the attack under disturbing circumstances.
He was released from prison with a deposit of $125 thousand.
Shooting civilians in the U.S. becomes a terrible norm.
Literally the morning, the man opened a shooting in the center of the city of Ridgecross, in the U.S. state of California, just on a walk on the street.
After that, the criminal captured two random passengers, hid them in the car bag and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting was opened in Newtown's primary school in Connecticut.
At school, the mother of Adam worked, she was a teacher.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl wounded
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 in an American school, this time in Antwerpen, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was small, Halloween was magical.
We and our sister were allowed to eat desserts, late not to sleep and make a mask for our area.
Now I am more like a square.
I have not been forced to distribute desserts in my apartment over the past two years and I’m probably not going to go this year.
However, the statistics show that I am a white wolf in terms of Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on coffee, costumes and jewellery.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is the trends.
The National Retail Trade Federation predicts that $1.2 billion of $6.9 billion will be spent on costumes.
This year, on the peak of fashion, sexual unthinkable objects.
Women no longer need to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual foods, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I’m sure the Daft Punk-style astronauts will be on our Instagram tracks this year.
According to Google, the costumes they’re looking for most are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing bad in the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
This means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t worry.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
This is about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds cheese, Twizzlers cheese and Clark Bar bottles.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is a great news for 41 million children who need sweets who are prepared to conquer our regions.
Moreover, we’ll buy and don’t cheat, we’ll eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is cheeses in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association of Conditioners, 35 million pounds of them are sold under Halloween.
This is about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a mystery that I have to find out.
Nothing expresses Halloween’s essence as a ghost home.
They have amazing names, such as "The Horror behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in the real prison), "War and Cry" and "House of Shock".
Moreover, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in America generating about $500 million income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described, which your friend posted on Facebook and you can’t remove, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like “class expression of the face.”
Finally, let’s talk about the tics.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Tick when we were children, and Jack's cutting lamp is like a Christmas tree decoration, what we've done from childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion on the baby in the tail started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up by cutting these tails rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Population Census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend about $106 million on tics.
Jack's lights, slowly drying on your wing, probably came from the state of Illinois, which grew this year 542 million pounds.
If you want tasks more complex, visit Tim and Susan Mattisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut out some of their tail with a weight of £2032.
Estonian Ministry of Defense site recovered after Ukrainian hackers attack
The work of the site of the Estonian Ministry of Defense has been restored after the morning cyber attack, the ministry’s press service reports.
According to Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense on Information and Administrative Affairs, Timor Peterskop, this was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded by a large number of requests.
Our experts quickly fixed everything, to the present time the work of the site has been restored.
“The damage caused to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will necessarily analyze the causes of the incident and make our conclusions, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he said.
On 1 November, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted a message in the network in which it confirmed the hacking attack on the site of the Estonian Ministry of Defense and spoke against the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Russia does not need Ukraine.
Ukraine should not be a slave.
We are committed to an independent Ukraine.
“Hands away from Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine that the group of the Maritime Infantry of the Feodosian separate batalion of the Ukrainian Maritime Infantry will take part in the command-stable exercises of the NATO reaction forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to the bullying of impur force, several schools and hospitals were closed.
Four schools in the Southern Matabelland province of Zimbabve had to be closed because the students were attacked by Goblin.
As the local elder said, the children were in panic, and to continue the classes was impossible.
The story of the Goblins may sound like a child's imagination for a European, but in Africa it is quite a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of impure strength.
In the summer, for example, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because the medical staff was also attacked by Goblin.

Russian forces do not know anything about the "Brother Circle" group - New News
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation.
“After the media appeared reports that the U.S. Department of Finance included Leps in the control lists of suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate ‘Brother Circle’, we looked at all the databases, but such groups were not found,” the agency’s spokesman said.
According to him, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which is allegedly operating abroad.
The U.S. Department of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brother's Circle".
Among them was named the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Greach", exposed the previous day.
They coincide with the data of the popular Russian artist.
The exact name is indicated - Gregory Lepseвридзе, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another ex-Soviet citizen whose citizenship is not stated.
In the U.S. they are confident that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, carried for the bandits money on their order.
This message is accompanied by a photo of the singer and all his data that corresponds to reality.
Moreover, Leps actually recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The entry of a person in the black list of the U.S. Ministry of Finance implies blocking his assets in the U.S. and prohibition of business contacts with him by persons living in the U.S.
Lepsa's assistant Maya Serikova said no notifications were made to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question whether it's Gregory, about whom everyone is talking now in connection with the US scandal."
All that Leps knows is the information of the media.
Officially there were no notifications to him personally, although I don’t know if they are in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she said to RIA Novosti.
According to her, Gregory Leps does not live on Phuket, but, as the U.S. Ministry of Finance says, he actually has a house on the Thai island.
She said that now Leps is in a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news stopped him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Escaped on the field in the match "Shinnik"
Some details have become known about the person of the fan who fled to the field during the 1/16 match of the final of the Cup of Russia between the Jaroslavsky "Shinik" and the Moscow "Spartak".
As the head of the KDK of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryanz, said, referring to the data of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this fan is a Moskovic.
He is currently detained.
“In addition to this, Grigoryans told about how the fan managed to break into the field: “It turned out that the person, let’s call him a spectator, went to emergency in accompaniment of two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to the emergency - this was confirmed by the emergency doctor.
Then he pulled out the two accompanyers and fled to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He fled through the whole field.
Styards are responsible for that.
Until the sport law enters into force, it is the zone of action of the steward - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He fled to the tribune, passing through the Eastern tribune.
And at that time the disruptions began on the Eastern Tribune and on the running roads," the head of the KDK said.
Remember that by the decision of the KDK, the Moscow "Spartak" will hold the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenita" without spectators, and will also pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire teams were called to rescue the lost dog who was stuck at a height of 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous step in his career.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small accident
Three days later, she, stuck in a career, saw a man walking a dog.
Firefighters went down on a rope on a rope to save the dog from inevitable death.
The puppy was lucky to be saved after the firefighters were called to lift him up and deliver him to a safe place after he somehow stumbled at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous staircase.
The nine-month cocker-spaniel Ruby fled after she was in a car accident on Sunday and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her owners, the 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Beckie Hall, were at the Flippit career in the city of Denholm in West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
They searched for their missing dog and posted links on social networks after she fled to a career after a small accident.
Approximately at 14:15 on Wednesday, the stardog noticed Ruby, stuck at a height of 50 feet on a step in his career.
The technical rescue unit from the Clekhiton fire station has rushed to the place of the incident, dropped down on the chains to save Ruby, and used the carrier to raise her up on the slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said, “She was in a dangerous situation.”
It was right in the middle of the slope - 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn’t move and the muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But now she is ok.
Then she eaten a cake.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
Rescue officer Peter Lao said, “Ruby was very lucky to be saved.”
It was likely that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, and it was found that it was all in order with her, except exhaust and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “To watch for salvation was terrible.”
I couldn’t believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had drowned and lost consciousness, she would probably fall.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave – what they did.
We were so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from the city of Kittley added: “We feared that it could fall, but it remained there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I can’t believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn’t play with Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a back vocalist for the 2004 Jagger song Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rock veteran and said, “He was playing with me when I was 18 years old.”
She added, “It was a long time, and he was very good.”
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the seven-year-old Jagger said that he “does categorically deny that he has ever attacked Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests in the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted on the first place this week.
George Kerevan: Breakdown with Europe gives Scotland a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the all-European free movement zone as a condition for membership in the EU.
It is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with a cylinder along the Adriatic valley.
Truly, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits from more free movements across the rest of Europe, although — what is predictable — it did not appear in the headlines.
No one also pointed out that the EU Member States spend a lot of time turning their formal rules to their convenience.
Since Scotland is now not part of the Schengen Zone, the continuation of non-compliance will be a cheap departure for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
This is not a history that deserves attention.
And it’s so old that it’s turned into a blindness: for the first time I’ve heard a “out” about “independence means passport control,” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the story of the old story.
Why should an independent Scotland comply with the orders of Europe?
Why change London's yarm to Brussels's yarm, especially now?
Here are the real European news: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally stopped.
With the Eurocrisis, the project “Europe” officially died.
Thro the European Union, the parties that oppose the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining force.
Even in Germany, the euroskeptic party “Alternative for Germany” – founded only this year – appeared from none and received five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pulling “Free Democrats” (analogue of our “Liberal Democrats”) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a breakthrough point.
The hard-saving measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on the national economies through the preservation of the single currency, led many people to think that the project “Europe” has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits—it was just fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members on the exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters, which the German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, Southern Europe is in a pre-profit position in terms of production capabilities compared to Germany.
The only rescue means is to cut wages and public expenses, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current problems of the budget and currency stand behind a deeper problem of the productive capacity of Europe.
As a result of the complex of “green” energy measures introduced by Brussels, a code that means subsidizing French and German energy companies on behalf of the consumer, the European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than in the US.
These are paralyzing unfavourable price conditions, as we have seen in Greenwich.
No freezing of wages in the world will stop the devastating victory of the U.S. cheap slurry gas over the European oil and chemical industry.
As a result, the rebellion becomes mature, especially in France, once the strongest EU supporter.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the destroyed economy of France in a disaster.
The result is that the right-wing anti-EU Marine Le Pen National Front has just won decisive additional elections, throwing the ruling Socialist Party to the third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes – a timely warning to British Labourists that it cannot come from the assumption that the division between the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly invented popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and that’s very likely – anti-EU parties get support in these elections, such a block will be able to occupy a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my opinion: the rapidly growing mood against the EU and against the single currency in Europe is united to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like the floating “Europe of (sovereign) nations,” which liked General de Gaulle.
Germany and several economies depend on it can retain the euro, but France and South Europe will restore their own currencies.
I suppose that Britain will distance from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the possibility that Britain will remain ignorant in the cold of the Atlantic.
What is the situation that leaves Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to the thresholds.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a more free European agreement, provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other single-minded countries will be easier in the non-Federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway’s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is — as strange as it is — the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against the measures of harsh savings, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to the objections against the cost cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Treasury Chancellor Alister Darling and subsequently arisen by the coalition of the Tory and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence only in order to take the hard saving measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturity: aging earlier
African-American and Latin-American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is close.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are guilty
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity can be one of the starting mechanisms of early sexual maturity
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so expressed in boys.
CNN's former correspondent Pat Etherage is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form pregnancies and hair grows at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents—usually it doesn’t mean a quick start of full sexual maturity,” Kaplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, spinal and submuscular hair and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a small shift in menarch age (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it passes at least two or three years before the menarch,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early sexual maturity in girls: how to deal with this common problem.
Time is the most accurate verification of how sexual maturity will progress.
There is a discussion about what is the actual occurrence of sexual maturity, but it is considered "pre-time" when the growth of the chest is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - this is what the pediatrist can monitor carefully.
The faster progression can serve as the basis for tests by an endocrinologist to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruations and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which in the end can lead to slow growth and low growth in mature age.
Recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is cautious with medications, but acknowledges that “suppression of sexual maturity can alleviate the behavioral problems and the feelings of girls that they are different from cousins.”
Another big problem is clear: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruations.
“They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene issues,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” reminds one woman whose daughter began menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and disappointed that she was the first among her friends.
There are many disseminated theories about the causes of early sexual maturity.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are guilty.
In boys, like girls, sexual maturity occurs earlier.
Caplovitz claims that the prerequisite that has the highest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the periods of sexual maturity.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin-American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
In the world, early sexual maturity is apparently affected by everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have hair on the face and neck appear at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual maturity is not as expressed as girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of acne and spinal hair occurs even in infants and young children.
“We need to be cautious about how we determine the true occurrence of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Gorib Children’s Hospital in Morristaun, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive instructions from the pediatrist about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean a earlier conversation than expected,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you keep calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who flourish early need confirmation that even when this happens earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
U.S. Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft Aircraft
The U.S. aircraft, which carried out observation flights over the territory of Russia within the framework of the Open Sky Treaty and carried out an unplanned landing in Chittagong on Wednesday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the airport of the city.
The airport's management authorized the flight, receiving money for fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other data, he will go to the United States.
According to the report, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Zabaikal region due to the cloud.
Due to unpaid accounts, he was not released from Chita airport.
30 people on board, including the crew, spent two nights on the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not entitled to go beyond the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 countries participating in it.
Observatory flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, the expansion of opportunities for crisis prevention and crisis resolution within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How Much Does the Dead Celebrity Make - MK in the US
The highest-income live celebrity ranking in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But she was "prepelled" by the deceased Michael Jackson, whose post-death income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
It is noticeably distant from him other survived celebrities, who last year "worried" a few times less.
The second in the list of the most "sustainable" missing celebrity, drawn up by the Forbes magazine by the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and the line below the author of the comics Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the first five were Elizabeth Taylor, the former leader last year (25 million), and the musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.

It was with these words that Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted... to take a look at the models!
Manufacturers of reactive aircraft fight about the width of seats when large orders on the horse
A sharp dispute has burned between the leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats of the tourist class on long-distance flights, putting a tone for a sharp confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute turns around the width of seats provided on long-distance flights to the economy-class passengers whose interests are not always at the center of airlines, while the volume of the space allocated to them plays a key role in the statement on the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economic-class rooms, but its main U.S. competitor Boeing says that it should be decided by airlines.
The dispute is in a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-motor long-distance aircraft, and on the event on 17-21 November, potential record orders are expected.
The composition of the back of the aircraft – especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row – occupies a central place in the statements on the economic efficiency of the new “minibus” projects.
Boeing says its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry in the economical class 350 people on 18 inches wide seats located 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants are often exchanged by technical issues through advertising in professional press.
And now Airbus is calling directly to the public before the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how the beginning of a new advertising war could be, showing financiers a slide that shows three people in the restaurant pressed to each other, entitled “Do you agree with it?”
“Boeing offers long-range flights on shorter seats than regional turbo-winning aircraft,” said Airbus sales chief John Lihi.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the broadband Boeing 747 set the standards of modern long-distance travel, and abroad of the century the weight of an average American man aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The range of the average American man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics of the U.S. Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average range of those recently called “reactive audience” was already.
Airbus says it ordered a study showing that extra inch in the seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’s seat sizes and says manufacturers shouldn’t interfere with the decision on how airlines can find a balance between tariffs and convenience.
According to her, research shows that the comfort of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s actually about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they should do to success,” said Boeing’s salon expert Kent Crawler.
They don’t want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the problem is increasing space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect the profit.
Behind this dispute is the race for aircraft orders, estimated at at least $700 billion at catalog price in the coming decades – enough to change the ratio of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first in July, the location of seats is exactly what warms the competition in the battle between the latest reactive aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing announce a 20-percent increase in profitability to one place in their latest two-motor highway models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-place Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of the Boeing are partially based on the comparison of the 10 seats 777X with the original 9 seats composition of the constructive solution 777.
The winning in the share cost is decreased compared to the 10-seat compound that is currently used.
“The reason that Boeing does this is to push more spaces and make our aircraft more competitive than our developments,” said Kevin Kenniston, head of Airbus’ European passenger comfort department.
On the other hand, analysts say that the full 10-seat rows for the existing 777 indicate that many passengers prefer a density that can go hand in hand with lower rates.
“The eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ offer is caused by a threat from the 777 model,” said Mary Kirby, interior specialist, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Travellers around the world reacting aircraft sellers even carry roulette to check competing planning.
Through the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very tight saloon composition for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for additional modifications of the salons, offering wider spaces at the passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the experts say, its call to the new industry standard is unlikely to “flight”, but it can distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777X.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine can stop the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before testing on humans starts, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Medical College of Well Cornell in New York said the first results are hopeful.
“We very much hope that this vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains an innocent virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine blow.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that were not vaccinated “released” and this is a sign that nicotine reached their brain, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, the injections were to be done so often that they were expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into an antibodies factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get this enjoyment because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that additional research was needed.
Oilers: a third of sub-Moscow rural settlements are fully donated
Sub-Governator Yuri Olejnikov said that a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully donational.
The total subsidy from the budget of the region receives 187 settlements of 288.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received grants from the regional budget.
The share weight of grants in the volume of income of the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - a hundred percent grants.
In the framework of budget security from the regional budget is directed about 25 billion rubles," said Oleynikov.
The deputy governor also noted that only in three urban settlements - Mutišč, Jedencovo and Pushkin - the volume of budget revenues is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Income of rural settlements in many districts less than 3 million rubles, "this is completely missing."
The costs for the maintenance of the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of Sub-Moscow are more than 70%, "at the same time there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleknikov noted.
Earlier, he commissioned the heads of sub-Moscow municipalities until the end of November to think about what settlements need to build up, unite into urban districts or change the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be drawn up by the end of January.
Previously, the governor of the Moscow region said that in the framework of the administrative reform in Sub-Moscow it is planned to reduce the number of dotational rural settlements.
Also in the Mojajsk, Kashirsk, Sunnychorsk, Kolomensk districts, Luberc and Kotnikah there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Moldavian Republic, Igor Brincalov, also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 sub-Moscow districts are planned to unite all within the framework of the upcoming admreform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in Sub-Moscow, less than a third have a "acceptable" financial base, and 100 have a donation base.
Diana Arbenina celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina doesn’t hide what great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that it is just now that Arbenina gives a lot of time to creativity and public activities, she still finds the opportunity to ride with Martha and Artem, not only spending time on their training, but also entertaining as much as possible.
During the last week, Diana twice to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday she shouted the fans, showing how she dressed Artem and Martha on Halloween.
“Our first halloween!” – so Diana called the photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
What’s unfortunate, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have a relationship with this holiday as they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe to introduce ‘uncertain gender’ when registration of children
Germany will become the first country in Europe to be allowed when registering children born with hermafrodites, instead of male or female gender to indicate "uncertain".
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the graffiti "sex" in the birth certificate unfilled for a while.
Instead of “F” (women’s gender) or “M” (man’s gender), parents can write “X” (undefined) for a time.
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush with the "precision" operation of gender.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermafrodite.
Tripodi denies that he is influenced by Obayed
Former Minister of Labour of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the figure of the investigation of the anti-corruption supervisory body of the state.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripody, denies the introduction of changes to the rental order of submarine facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddy Obed, who secretly owned shares in three real estate facilities on state land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday extended its investigation of whether Mr. Obeid has lobbyed with several state ministers the extension of the lease agreement to Circular Ki, where the family of Obeid owns two restaurants and cafes, without passing the tender after the expiry of their term in August 2005.
She is now investigating claims that Mr. Tripodi knew about Mr. Obayed’s secret participation in real estate, after the testimony given by Mr. Tripodi’s former Deputy Head of Administration, Mr. Lynn Ashpoul, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the rental was presented for an open competition.
The renters were against this and also wanted longer lease periods.
In 2009, the rental contracts of enterprises on Circular Ki, which brought about $2.5 million a year to the family of Obayed, were extended without exposure to an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially spoke for open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at Mr. Obayed’s request, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, strongly advised to make changes to the government’s rental policy.
The ICAC-presented decryption of telephone conversations included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obed, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the port ministry after working under Mr. Obed’s leadership in the fishing department.
“Are the question discussed during these telephone conversations a question of the development of the commercial rental policy?” asked Anthony Willy, assistant Commissioner, Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was not that.
Surely not between me and Mr. Obed.
According to a senior official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets inside Syria.
A senior official in the administration in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft attacked a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify that it was for the goal, but said that at least one.
The Associated Press that the target was the missiles of the Russian manufacturing SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel made airstrikes on cargoes with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers with sub-class visa 457 may be tested for “reality”
The “authenticity” test for foreign workers with visa class 457 is under government consideration as it intends to expand repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied in accordance with the criteria aimed at preventing the use of visa class 457 to complete unqualified positions or as a slider for the move of family and friends to Australia.
The document presented by the government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McCoy criticized the government's rhetoric regarding foreign workers, saying it could hurt Australian neighbors.
“The loud statements such as ‘strangers are at the end of the line’ and ‘the Australian workers’ are a very unpleasant breakthrough to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be defended—and if some in the region saw the reflections of this historical artefact, I’t be surprised.
The presented document explains 12 measures that were previously discussed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he met with officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are in the stage of consideration.
If the “authenticity” criteria are adopted, the visa applicant will be able to be investigated on whether “the application is authentic in the conditions where the applicant is a relative or close-known owner or a person related to the funding of the enterprise.”
Companies may also be required to report on the number of subclass visa holders 457, since earlier companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan, seeking asylum, has died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The dead nine-year-old son of this man was accompanied by him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he was supported by a two-year-old brother, who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities urgently sent the man to a hospital on the island of Christmas, where he died.
The friend of Semena Varlamova said the hockey player is suffering from alcoholism
The friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov, Yevgeny Vovrinjuk, said that he suffered alcoholism, the Russian News Service reports.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
We remind that Vovrinjuk has filed a trial for battle against the Russian football team Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled her out for her hair, and also hit her - after the attack her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with a duty to the police of Denver and admitted in the shooting, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released under a $5,000 deposit.
The court did not restrict the athletes in their movements throughout the country, but banned them from approaching Vovrinjuk.
He is also threatened to a prison of up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project proposes the opening of high-speed communications with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026.
The transport minister, Baronessa Kramer, said the project will “unite the UK.”
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was “ excited” about the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first step will be the construction of a new high-speed railway between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has ordered HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reduction in travel duration for North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility to overcome the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronessa Kramer said: “Our goal on HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We develop HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a crossover crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the transportation of cities with each other; throughout the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive the best message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alister Carmaykl added: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Kitt Brown called on Mr. Carmaykl to “one-mindedly” support Scotland’s inclusion into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “High-speed railway has all the chances of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for high-speed railway throughout the UK.”
Therefore, we are delighted to work in partnership with the UK government to consider the possibilities of building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburg railway, which is already planned by the Scottish government.
I am looking forward to discussing the results of the study with the British ministers next year and a joint decision on the following steps.
Is Turkey a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments throughout the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Burning carbohydrates (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
The atomic energy goes without the same, but leaves a mass of expensive in the recycling of waste.
Recently, scientists paid attention to the tory, another radioactive element of the Mendeleyev system.
It is found all over the world, and, as experts say, its breakdown does not leave waste that needs to be stored for centuries.
The rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia are still in force.
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during landing and landing, despite U.S. measures to mitigate the rules concerning these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures in such a way that passengers can read ebooks, watch videos or play games on their devices during landing and landing, provided they will remain in the "Flight Mode".
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoying that they do not have access to their e-books during landing and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required U.S. airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but said they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Administration also noted that they are considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Administration currently has no special rules regulating the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by the rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety rules informed by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Administration the expansion of the use on board of its Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the regulator's instructions.
“We would welcome the review by the Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Administration of the issue of permission for the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now when it is on our aircraft,” the spokesman said.
Qantas said it will follow the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during landing and landing, and we do not plan to change it in the near future,” she said.
The FAU decree applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will definitely carefully study the FAU solution and the reasons that caused it.
For U.S. carriers, the influence of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their airport.
Carriers will be required to prove that their aircraft are radio-resistant from mobile devices, as well as to review the benefits, the training materials, the standard on the wiring of the handbag and the guidelines for passengers.
“After the airline has verified and confirmed the interference resistance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height,” the FAU said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group’s recommendation, more heavy devices should be placed under seats or in the upper baggage sections during landing and landing.
The head of Dagestan will hear in Cuba's hymn the notes of extremism
The football match between "Angie" and "Cuban" went into a political collision between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kubani hymn sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday proposed to the Republican parliaments to appeal to court because the hymn of the Krasnodar region allegedly calls for inter-national diversity, in particular, calls for war with the "basurman".
Take the hymn of the Krasnodar region, this is in our time in 1995 approved this hymn.
It is a shame, and no one is doing it.
"On you here remembering, as a mother of the mother, on the enemy, on the basurman, we go to the death struggle" - for what such words to record in the hymn, to throw some believers on other believers," - expressed solidarity with the President of the Parliament Hizri Sikhsaidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we became known today, Israel attacked the missiles of Russian production, which, according to reports, were intended for Hezbollah.
Syria has fulfilled an important condition to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached under the mediation of Russia and which allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation, which they closely approached this summer.
More details about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president will be told by our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of U.S. bombings, but in the form of an agreement arranged by Assad’s friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important wave.
A group of international experts that Syria has dismantled the claimed chemical weapons factory.
The more long-term and difficult task is to destroy a ton of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, it is about a thousand tons.
Washington has said that the days of Assad are counted.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and has to leave.
But Assad remains.
He feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalms.
His opponents are disguised and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are hungry.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad has avoided punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a person ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is unlikely to be easier than being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad still stands.
We change weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and Construction
Russian President Vladimir Putin has established a new ministry addressing construction and residential infrastructure issues and proposed to head it to the former Governor of the Ivanov region Mikhail Mnu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Menem in the residence in Novogarevo, and Men refused to head the new ministry.
Russian President's spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and residential infrastructure are transferred to a new ministry from the Ministry of Agriculture.
Mikhail Men, the son of the famous Orthodox priest of the prototype Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergey-Posad region, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first vice-prime minister of the Moscow region, the vice-prime minister of the Moscow government.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanov region.
Lombard owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In a lombard in the shopping center of Bendemir in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts a golden bracelet, ring and ring to pay for her daughter’s school education.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money was invested there,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 a month as an administrator and her husband also works, her family’s monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in different parts of Southeast Asia — where the volume of household debt is growing — is that ValueMax, where it is doing its transaction, this week became the third lombard registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewelry loan is not just a quick way to get money ($1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but is almost as cheap as unassured bank loans.
Typically, lombards in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – a little above 15.4%, offered at the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same trading center.
However, lombards have the advantage that they do not require credit check or salary evidence and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are dealing with lombards as families feel pressure due to the increased cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustainable growth, followed by the global financial crisis, and cheap loans and free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning into lombards to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulders, mainly due to the growth of mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of domestic debt to GDP in Asia.
Malaysia headed this list with 80% of GDP compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week hardly came out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening in consumer demand.
“The essence is that with the rise of prices, people in the middle and lower will look for ways to fill their income where they can,” says Song Seng Won, economist at CIMB, the Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices in the past two years have increased the hurry with which people put their personal things as they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewellery.
In Singapore, approximately 70% of the things placed in the city-state 200 lombard points are gold products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put a grandmother’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest lombard operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its departments in recent months.
Growth in the lobbying business is that ValueMax, a department operator in Bendemira and 15 other similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeh Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million attracted this week as a result of the stock placement on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors have triggered a fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the Lombard not only offers cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also does not increase the debt directly.
“Clients place the items they already possess, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The fund gains increasingly widespread public recognition as a means of receiving short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, the lobards are not only those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax departments by placing gold slides or Rolex clocks that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all layers of society.
“These include wealthy people who need to take money for a short term for commercial projects or investments, or small that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” says Mr. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is important for the population not the number of available medical facilities and their status, but the quality of the medical care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of the health of the Tulsk region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of the medical facilities of our city will allow to create the optimal structure of providing medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant and nurses.
So, after the association with the hormone, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the GUS "NGCB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the home was significantly improved, modern equipment that meets the world standards appeared.
For these years, approximately 8 million rubles were allocated for the capital repair of premises, 112 units of equipment were acquired for the amount of 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intense post for newborns.
In the surgical process of the caesareal cut, the "Sell-Saver" appliance is used, which allows to collect blood from the surgical wound and after special treatment to return its birthplace, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinical laboratory diagnostics department.
In the female consultation, electronic registration works, in the near future, the introduction of electronic cards and patient disease stories is planned.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, there has been the possibility of consulting gynecological patients, pregnant women, infants and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens kill and steal 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnya kidnappers are arrested by the French police for suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been carried out since March of this year.
About 60 women complain about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits ordered a prostitute to one of the Strasbourg hotels and then killed and stealed them.
The head of the band was a 27-year-old previously convicted descendant of Chechnya.
The Bavarian defender David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he was ahead of the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was occupied by skiers Marcel Hirscher, and the third is the ski jump from the tram Gregor Schlirenzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Philippine-Nigerian origin helped his team win in the Champions League, the Championship and the Cup of Germany, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Former wife of Arshvina is resting with actor Andrey Chadov
The former civil wife of Peter's "Zenita" footballer Andrei Arshovina Yulia Baranovskaya is on vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zodorna, her married figureist Sergey Slavny, and actress Andrea Chadova.
Photos from the joint walks of the couple have been posted on Instagram Anastasia Western.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrea and Julia.
On October 5, Zadarjona published a photo on which the couple stands hanging on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the "Zenita" hub, Andrei Arshavin, admitted that he lived separately from his civil wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is meeting with the former model Alisa Kazmina.
The new friend of Arshavin was married to the top manager of the corporation.
$325 million rescue package for health in Tasmania
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for the weakened health system of Tasmania will be supplemented with strict conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Society is taking “term measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the population aging of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The decision on financing for four years was made after the government’s consultations with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Plybersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a blitz campaign on planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including ortopedic and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the distraction.
There are also money for clinics receiving patients without prior registration, in Hobart and London, to improve the quality of post-hospital care, training medical professionals, mental health services and the implementation of personal electronic medical cards systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go on the advanced doctors expressed the realization of the ideas on how better to help the health system of Tasmania,” said Mrs. Plibersek.
The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will work in a manner of strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain the current levels of financing in order to receive the Community funds, and to report monthly on where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person committee will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Willky said that $325 million will not resolve anything “if they do not follow a genuine reform that will put Tasmania’s healthcare system on a more sustainable basis.”
However, he praised the government for his response to his emergency aid request, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the removal of the state’s health system from a critical state,” Mr. Willky said.
According to the state government, these additional electoral procedures will significantly compensate for recent cuts.
But the federal opposition representative for health Peter Datton believes that today’s statement is “a solution similar to the leukoplasty.”
“The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the state has sparked $430 million from the healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state’s government breaks almost half a billion dollars and the Society invests 300 million, we can’t pretend that it’s good news.
Mr. Datton asked Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening by Giom Nickle of Danny Dido’s novel may be proud of its exclusive performance and historical details, but it’s also harder to perceive than it should have been.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat, sent to the monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebell, she experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of the sadist-heroist and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never falls down to foolishness or sensation—and that’s the whole problem.
Due to its serious celebrity, narrative risks to become a test like a hairdresser and for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its means of chemical weapons, the observation group says
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisoning gas, the international observatory group said on Thursday, while severe collisions were in the north of the country, near one of the facilities where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The Declaration of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November established by this Hague-based organization is that Damascus will destroy or “make unfunctionable” all means of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow mixing chemicals with the production of poisoning gas and filling them with ammunition.
The conclusion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including garlic gas and nerve-paralytic gas sarin.
This statement was made during the intense struggles on Thursday in the city of Safir, where, according to experts, a chemical weapons facility is located, as well as the place of its storage, the UK-based Syrian Center for the Protection of Human Rights reports.
A group of activists, which tracked losses through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of this number, 61,067 are civilians, including 63,65 children.
According to the government, 29 954 people are members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad, 18 678 are pro-government militants and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2202 army refugees and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the UN estimates of July 25, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's armies have been fighting in Safir for several weeks with rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said that on Thursday there were victims from both sides, but did not provide specific data.
The battles highlighted the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are facing under the compressed deadlines of their mission to liberate Syria from the toxic arsenal, at the forefront of the ongoing civil war.
The OECD, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “now satisfied with the fact that it has checked and seen all the critical means of production and equipment for mixing/reparation declared by Syria being destroyed.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they completed the first round of inspection work, visiting 21 of the 23 facilities declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OECD said the two places were, according to the statement of Syria, “abandoned and... the objects of the chemical weapons program in them were moved to other declared places that were checked.”
It was not possible to immediately find out whether the object in Safir was one of the two places that the OZHO inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which is expected to be approved next month by the OECD executive committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most complicated mission that this organization has ever undertaken,” said General Director of the Observatory Group, Ahmet Uzumju, in a commentary published by the OCHO.
For the third year, the Civil War has encountered rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, which are made up of members of its al-Alavit sect, the responsibility of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center Rami Abdulrahman said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the coastal province of Syria Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Prisoning for the organizers of the attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bomb explosion reacted angry to the sentence sentenced to the last of the conspirators who appeared before the court, and said that Umar Patek should be shot down.
Patek, who spent 10 years running as one of the most sought-up people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the explosives used during the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he receives conditional-term release.
The 45-year-old was accused of mass murder as a result of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, during which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens were wounded.
He was also convicted of a number of other terrorist accusations, including the wave of church explosions throughout Indonesia on Christmas Canyon in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime, although they could insist that a person called a “supporter” for his reputation as a master in the manufacture of explosives should be sentenced to death.
This decision worsened the painful memories of Perth's mother, June Curtin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patech and his companions almost ten years ago.
Just holding tears, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must stand in front of the shooting team,” said Mrs. Curtin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device placed in a parked outside truck was launched immediately after the 11th evening of October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the Peddy Bar, where a terrorist-death exploded a suitcase started with a bomb, just 20 seconds earlier.
After this attack, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should divide the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell "Jemaah Islam", responsible for the bloody battle - Amroshi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To save his life, no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last of the participants in the Bali terrorist attack presented before the court.
He was hiding for ten years, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former Al-Qaeda head Ussam bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the data of intelligence witnessed that Patech was in Pakistan to meet with Ben Laden in an attempt to restore ties between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” said Mrs. Curtin.
Until recently, he had no regret of how much evil he caused to other people.
The sentence was issued in front of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Mrs. Curtin.
Patek may also appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not call from their mobile phone)”
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Worth said at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show the FAU how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their training grants for the crew members and the arrangement rules in order to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAU said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already presented plans.
“According to the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAU said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft’s door is closed.
They should not reboot them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain does not give "good".
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aircraft is down for landing, and do not turn off them until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during landing, landing and riding.
Most new airlines and other aircraft, modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at large heights, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, the chairman of the Association of Professional Board Guides, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy will be successfully implemented (and we’re going to work in close contact with the carrier to this), this will be an unbeatable option,” Gliding said.
We are honestly tired of feeling “official at school” when it comes to this issue.
But internet connection for surfing, e-mail exchange, text messages or data download will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to the aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no "Words with Friends" - an intelligent internet game in which actor Alek Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the shocking incident occurred: the actor was removed from the American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device at the time the aircraft was at the departure.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still need to be placed in the luggage, as they can hurt someone if they will fly throughout the hall.
Phone calls on the flight will also be prohibited.
The regulatory powers on telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not to the FAU.
FAU may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during landing and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Council for Traffic Safety, the national expert on Traffic Safety CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FX that they can create interference for mobile communications when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Industry Advisory Committee, established by the FAU to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on FAU has increased in order to weaken the restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as Senator-Democrat from Missouri, Claire McCasky, argue that there are no serious security-related reasons for the ban.
Compliance with the restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become universal.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to restrict the use of passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and supported by FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the crossover height for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of the aircraft are adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Werta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Electronic books reading devices, for example, emit only minimal signals when browsing pages.
But the signals become more powerful when devices upload or send data.
Among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the entire airline with their Kindle e-books reading devices and flew on it to check the existence of problems but never found them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices is a risk.
Douglas Kid, from the National Aviation Passenger Association, said he believes the disruptions from the devices are real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only individual pilot messages confirming that the devices could create disruptions to the aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAU to allow the pilots to demand passengers to disable the devices during landing on the devices in conditions of limited visibility.
A group of tourism industry representatives welcomed these changes, calling them a thoughtful step towards passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAU acknowledges that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to take the driving licence exam.
Driving rights exam may be accepted by private companies that have their own computerized motorway.
This is written by "Kommersant" with reference to the government resolution "On admission to the management of vehicles".
As the newspaper writes, at the moment in Russia only about 30 such autodroms.
It is expected that students of such "priority" automotive schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Automotive Inspection will monitor the submission of exams every six months.
If it becomes clear that more than 30% of theory exams and more than 20% of the place students do not pass from the first time, such school will be deprived of privileges for a six-year period.
The technical requirements for autodroms contained in the draft government resolution shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for the training of two-wheel drive engineering.

A bird thrown in the air to a safe place with a storm in the North Sea is thrown back into the wild.
The bird, thrown by air to the coast after it was found in an exhausted state on the oil hill in the North Sea, was thrown back into the wild.
This water sheep was placed in a helicopter to Aberdin last month, and then it was removed by the Scottish Division of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Violence (SPCA) in a rescue center in Aloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: “This water sheep is most likely a winter immigrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a strong wind zone above the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was obsessed and was able to find asylum on the oil hole.
He added, “She was unable to fly again, so they asked us for help.”
The water sheep was healthy and in good condition until it was released.
Are Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to gather business representatives and determine what changes the UK’s well-being and jobs creators want to see in relations with the EU.
For this purpose, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, the business and the EU.
YouGov has surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing the wide range of business in the UK by size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be unexpected for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying special attention to the countries that are modernizing and growing while the EU countries are in a stop.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on the long and difficult process of reforming confused EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders thought that the control of these key spheres of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives stated that the regulation costs from Brussels now exceed the benefits of being in the European trade zone, — even 40 percent of the major enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreed to this.
Last and most indicative – our business managers survey revealed that a clear majority wants Britain to take a course to change the treaty and to relations with the EU based on trade and not on policy.
This result, which was observed among of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business insists on a “significant change” that will return powers back to the UK.
The rates are high – achieving the treaty changes and more favourable conditions for the UK will ensure a 16-percent shift in voting for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubts: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the terms of the UK’s membership in the EU.
He also shows that the business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the UK.
Best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming more and more necessary as the euro area is moving on the path of a closer economic and financial union.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory activities of Brussels.
U.S. officials listen to Pope's personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under vigilant control of the U.S. intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection indicate that the U.S. intelligence has been listening to all the negotiations of the former Pope Benedict, and is now closely caring for Pope Francis.
His phone began to be heard before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of the election of the new Father was also monitored.
What is given special importance in the United States.
The special service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The telephones of the residence, where the participants lived, were also heard.
American spies listened to all the main candidates for the Pope's throne to prevent the appearance of an unwanted figure on it for Washington.
The "Panorama" magazine writes that the "big ear of the U.S." continued to capture the talks of the prelates until the conclusion of the conclamation on March 12.
It is confirmed that in the United States since 2005 the Archbishop Bergoglio was awarded as the future of the Pope of Rome.
The U.S. intelligence also delayed negotiations related to the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and ANB operators continues to work at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, collecting information about policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has reconcilably announced that he is not concerned with the American "audience", even if it is happening.
From the U.S. leadership the Holy Fathers have no secrets.
The snowboardist for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a memorial banknotes dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
Nominated bills - 100 rubles.
But in the network bloggers are already actively ironising about the memorable banknotes.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknotes on October 30, they paid attention to the fact that the image of a snowboardist from the banknotes can be found in the photo banks.
In particular, in the free StockExchange photo storage, where this photo dates back to 2005.
The same photo is used in the lesson on Photoshop, published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknotes are made in a blue-blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flies over Sochi, and on the other - the appearance of the Olympic stadium and the Hot Bird.
Author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping from the trampoline, but in the end they chose snowboard because it is a relatively young sport.
According to the source "Izvestij", close to the central bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public about the widespread dissemination of the image of the snowboardist from the Olympic banknotes and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknotes.
The head of the press service of the State Department, Natalia Nikiforova, told the News that all considerations about the plagiarism are funny.
Snowboarders on the banknotes will be turned to the right, on the photos on the network - to the left, Nikiforova said.
The man on the photo session to create the banknotes was taken from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - a characteristic posture of a snowboardist.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknotes as the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic billboard is quite positive.
The awareness of the image on the bill - plus for its promotion, - says the executive director of the NP "Rusbrand" Aleksei Popovichev.
Proofing a hundred percent similarity of images on the banknotes and in photo banks is quite difficult, so claims for complaining intellectual property on this image are unlikely to come.
For the first time the Olympic banknote appeared in China - a memorial banknote of 10 yuan was issued at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer
The Russians have a bad mood.
According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country in the coming year will remain at the previous level, and that’s in the best case.
Even though the businessmen initially expected growth.
After all, this year has failed for them: sales have fallen by 7 percent.
About all this said the head of one of the largest beer companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian beer manufacturers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Tawars of Daily Demand in Russia", which was just completed in Moscow.
It discussed the regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, since in recent years there is a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the part of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with low alcohol content, - Sheps told the listeners.
No country in the world has such a strict limitation of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of all new and new unlogic prohibitions, which are allegedly justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
Pivovar visited that many legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing the level of alcohol abuse do not have a particular impact, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
Most of the beer producers hit the prohibition introduced since this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers,” Isaac Sheps said.
For the next year, the beer manufacturers have two forecasts.
The optimist is the one that Sheps said: the sale of penny beverage remains at the previous level.
Pessimistic - they will fall another 2-3 percent.
To preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the varieties intended for the mass consumer to the premium class: beer will be less, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of the decline of sales with a small amount of alcohol are not seen yet.
“According to my observations, the level of illnesses with alcoholism remains approximately at the same level,” said the drug doctor Alexey Sottnikov.
Indeed, the proportion of patients who consume surrogates of strong drinks has grown, as well as those who "subsidized" on alcohol-containing toning drinks such as "Yaguar", while ten years ago the "bottle" alcoholism dominated.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford car factory in Allowologsk.
According to the trade unions, all dismissed have received compensation.
However, much harder than the problems of workers, the question of reduction of production in the region is emerging.
A deputy of the regional ZXA, Aleksei Etmanov, said at the meeting that about 600 people were reduced at the Ford factory in Allowologsk.
According to him, this happened in September: then, according to the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the organization’s trade union, about 600 people left the factory.
Workers who decided to leave on their own will were proposed "gold parachutes" in the amount of several deposits.
Because of this, the vast majority left jobs on their own will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night change.
I think this will not be limited.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to take any programs of support to regional enterprises in difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a significant decrease in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not denied or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
The talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford factory in Allowologsk have been on a long time.
So, for example, about the plans of the company to dismiss 600 people became known in September.
Previously, the factory announced the suspension of the production of cars.
As the cause at the factory was called the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to the data of Petrostat, according to the results of nine months of 2013 the volume of industrial production in Leningrad decreased by 5.4%.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
The U.S. will be able to use mobile devices during landing and landing.
New rules for safe use of mobile devices during landing and landing are approved in the United States, BBC reports.
The U.S. airline is expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new rules will enter into force by the end of 2013.
However, internet connection for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights at a height below 3 km.
Due to the danger of interference with the radio equipment of the aircraft, cellular voice communication will continue to be banned.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be obliged to check the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
Furthermore, airlines will have to convince the Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to deal with the supposed impact of mobile on aircraft engineering and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, for example, in the United States, the current rules of use of electronic devices in flights may also be revised.
The "Russian Mafia" in the U.S. has finally established a new name - "Brother Circle"
This week, the black list of the "Russian mafia" in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and a Israeli to the Brotherhood Circle.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Gregory Leps, whom the United States is suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
The U.S. Black List includes 22 members of the Brotherhood Circle and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such a organization really exists.
“The statement of the Brother’s Circle is more about an attempt to unite divided criminal groups,” said formerly organized crime expert and professor at the University of New York, Mark Galeotti.
According to him, the “Brother Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” Mr. Galeotti quotes the American Center for the Investigation of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti has also agreed with Professor Lisa Shelley at the University of George Mason.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” the Center for the Research of Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti had the assumption that the Brotherhood Circle unites mostly the closest of the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Ded Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashy Shushanashvili and Zakhary Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandfather Hassan, and another list member, Themuri Mirzoev, was the grandfather Hassan's grandson.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals have no relationship with Usoyan.
According to him, all of them were associated with common financial and criminal interests, such as drug supplies from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal around the inclusion in the "Brother Circle" of Gregory Leps - the favorite singer of the Russian President Vladimir Putin - has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American colleagues and partners, in connection with which such a decision has been made, why it has been included in such lists, the spokesman of the head of state Dmitry Peskov said.
In any case he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, their interests will be protected.
Gazprom head Alexey Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, Gazprom’s head said.
“Today, a significant event has occurred: the construction of the Bulgarian gas pipeline South Stream, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream is designed to diversify the export routes of Russia through Europe.
The dispute on the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, in which the majority of the Russian gas intended for Europe is located, increases the level of risk for ordinary routes, officials say.
Miller said the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated “for ever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the whole project begins to work in 2015.
Gazprom said the construction should begin in other countries further on the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees are accused of sexual crimes even before accusations against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has known
Two YMCA NSW employees were accused of sexual crimes against children before the 2011 charges against the child care institution worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence on Children.
But the commission’s entry statement said that it “has never had a deal with cases of sexual assault against children within its organization.”
The chief executive Philip Hayra was asked for one case when a YMCA worker was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and for another case when an instructor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayr told the lawyer Gale Ferness that he knew the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA in the commission's introductory speech also admitted inaccuracy, claiming that "there were YMCA's external inspections that recognized that YMCA was in the first place to ensure children's safety."
The presented certificate committee says that YMCA was notified that it received the second from the end of four possible assessments on the quality audit results carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hayer, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that he and the underlying leadership made a failure by hiring the Lord, and also failed to provide a clear understanding by staff of his obligations regarding reports of child safety policies violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during two years of his work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayr rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA prevented employees from reporting Lord’s child safety violations.
The staff gave evidence that they observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, cared for them personally, sat them to himself on the knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Oquell, who was under Lord’s leadership and asked her to train her to protect children because she was worried about his behavior, witnessed that she found Jackie Barnat, the Child Care Manager of the YMCA department in Karingbach, who was Lord’s head, “very scary and often difficult to reach.”
The Executive Director said he did not accept the explanations of employees that it was uncomfortable for them to report the situation to their senior executives.
Instead, according to him, their friendship with the Lord led them from the thought of the need to report about him.
Mr. Hayer said he presented his opinion to the YMCA Council of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from the “accident with Jonathan Lord” is not “cashed by the information provided” by the staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayr said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations appeared was adopted by YMCA’s Director-General for Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said it was intended to prevent the failure of evidence, but at the same time they were “exaggerated” and the decision was misrealised.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe for children organization while working in it by Jonathan Lord in the period 2009-2011, said the commission expert on children's growth problems Professor Stephen Smolboon from the University of Griffith.
He said there were “serious problems” in the collection, selection, instruction, training and control of staff.
Hearing is postponed to 20 December.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
She in her homeland is considered not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Zizel Bündchen for some time left her job and drove herself to maternity, in these days and on this week she arrived specifically.
The many-month absence did not prevent her from preserving her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giesel remains the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the defile of the "Kolchchi" brand.
The end of the Fashion Week is usually the most interesting shows.
It was organized by stylist Lino Villaventura.

Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance to return as Prime Minister, but he acknowledges that the return is unlikely.
Last night in an interview dedicated to the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various aspects of internal policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years of leadership, Blair has largely avoided the discussion of British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Middle East Peace Makers.
Answering the question whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that it will happen, so ...”
Milan's chief coach, Massimiliano Allegri, expressed his regret for the outcome in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.

I'm very sorry that we couldn't win, - tmw tells Allegri.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good chances.
In the first half, we didn’t let Lazio.
In the second Roman added, but in general I can’t say that we lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season we had the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are behind the schedule, but this is due to a whole series of injuries of key footballers.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players with a character.
However, our composition is good now.
Look at Kaka, who held a meeting at a high level.
Experts from fishing events gathering to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a pupil, just a few months before that made his first steps, this little boy with his pet, the Shetland ponny Toffy rushed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable pair – the same growth – received high awards for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sannibenk horse sport center in the city of Radri near Cardiff.
Going out to the general view on the background of men and women in elegant socks, he moved his hat and proudly spent the cycle of the two-year-old Toffy.
Judges praised Fenton for his non-year-old inherited ability to deal with horses.
And Toffy received the highest appreciation for his appearance and character.
Fenton was presented by Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been engaged in Shetland ponny every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, “Fenton and Toffy are a wonderful duet.”
They had a lot of rivals, but the two left with a golden cup and a rose.
This was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all excited when he won.
Unknown people on the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, which is near Abb-Wale in South Wales, walks on the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has exhibited horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, “The entire audience was shocked, and everyone was screaming approval votes and fooling.”
He was running on the sand throughout the arena and, although he looked so small, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is foolish about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he takes care of.
Judging how he started, he will soon take part in the Horse of the Year – and I am sure he will perform well.
A representative of this annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
Judges pointed out Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and how they present themselves on the show ring.
They evaluate the coherence of the performance of Pony and the manufacturer — Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I am confident that Fenton was helped by his attractive order, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper calls for “reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which has published a call on the release of the reporter accused of fraud, must be reorganized, the regulator of the press reports.
The New Express newspaper in Guangzhou made an unexpected public statement with a request for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later acknowledged on television that he was taking the responses for writing false articles about a company with a state-owned share.
Now the “New Express” has to go through the “full correction process”, according to the regulator.
The order for “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong administration in the field of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
A preliminary investigation found that the Yangcheng Evening News Group newspaper "New Express" published several false reports about the stock market company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial leadership of the New Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He that the decision was made “to impose an administrative appeal on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revocation of his journalist license.”
He also told the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended it to conduct an investigation of the situation-related responsibilities of the newspaper and to make immediate changes to the New Express board.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for The New Express, in which he declared financial breaches in the construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published on the first line two calls for his release, saying it supports his journalistic activity.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on the state television with the admission that he was publishing false articles for money.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he said to the state broadcasting company CCTV.
I did this mainly because I was thirsty for money and glory.
I realized my fault.
After the recognition of Mr. Chen, the New Express published apologies on the first line, saying the newspaper failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of breaking out confessions in China is still widespread, despite the recent amendments to the laws that prohibit authorities from forcing anyone to self-conclude.
Discovered US-Mexico drug repair tunnel equipped with its own railway
It was found one of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The U.S. authorities have described this four-to-three-foot tunnel as one of the most complicated secret routes they’ve ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzag length is almost six football fields, connects the warehouses near the city of Tihuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with invisible warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were unsightly transmitted through it, the authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to the law enforcement, worked as drivers were charged with storing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of spreading.
In case of conviction, they are threatened with a prison period from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nagales, Arizona, the smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest passenger that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after a marijuana harvest in October, which set the narcotic cartels a difficult task to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards, equipped with railways that went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.

British police give Assange notification of extradition
The British police today delivered a notification of the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who hid in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yarde said they gave an Australian 40-year-old "official claim to surrender" with a request to appear at the police station, adding that if this claim is not fulfilled, he will be further subject to arrest.
Assange is threatened to be extradited to Sweden for sexual crimes after he exhausted his capabilities in accordance with the British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm will transfer him to the United States, on June 19 he hid in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, asking for political asylum from this South American country.
“Scotland Yard has given a 40-year-old man an official request to give up, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time we choose,” the spokesman said.
It continues to violate the conditions of release under warranty.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to submit him possible charges of spy after the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic records on the anti-secret site WikiLeaks.

The driver was sentenced to £1,000 for driving at a speed of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his feet.
The 35-year-old Andrew Howe from Tiptry, Essex, was noticed by driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Brentry on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to be taken from him between his feet.
In the world court, Colchester Howe acknowledged the accusation of driving without reasonable consideration and attention.
Adding seven punishment points to his driver's license led to a six-month driving ban.
Howey also pledged to pay £90 expenses and £100 extra charge to help victims of crime.
Tax for foreign real estate owners will lead to the fact that the London bubble breaks
The Treasury carried out a preliminary assessment of the increase capital tax measures, but awaits a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% state tax rate for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in the company rather than as individuals.
Currently, the housing property in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea districts, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, northeastern, northeastern, Yorkshire and Hamburg jointly taken.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in the tax on expensive houses and the introduction of the related anti-evacuation legislation, it is very difficult to say that the taxation of expensive real estate is low regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step may lead to the fact that some foreign investors will unwillingly buy a real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The price of first-class real estate – the top 5–10% of the housing market by price – in the rich southwestern belt of London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose to a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in the center of London continued to demonstrate a sustainable growth of 5.6% in the annual calculation, but they were overwhelmed by the actively developing “patriotic market” with prices rising in the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists revealed how the dog's neck movements are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs swallow with a tail to the right side (from the dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs swallow with a tail mostly to the left side.
But now scientists say that other representatives of the family of dogs can notice these thin differences in whiling with the tail and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Valortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
As with humans, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs' heads, the researchers watched the animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably soon we will understand why their tails sometimes move to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Valortigara said: “We showed dogs a video with dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other disturbing factors, and we could manipulate the hole movement and direct the hole more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest of the no-expressing dog moved the tail to the right (from the point of view of the tailing tail dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was predominantly inclined to the left (the foundation from the point of view of the swallowing tail of the dog), their heartbeat began and they looked worried.
Professor Valortigara said he didn’t think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should worry about and what no.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and frequently wrapping their tail on one side is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say these findings can give owners, veterinarians and trainees a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshow, a guest researcher at the University of Bristol's veterinary school, said this was not the first study to verify whether the left and right sides are relevant for dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, he, “The dogs were more frequently approached to a working dog when the wing of her tail was directed to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – a behavior opposed to the Italian study.”
He said the differences could be because dogs in different studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
"While there are sufficient evidence from different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified, and dogs are not an exception," he said.
However, taking into account the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes move to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This cheffield group was supposed to perform at the city concert square Hydro on Friday.
However, the disease of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to transfer the show.
The group's statement was made after it was also forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to transfer the show at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after the request for medical assistance, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at the Hydro Square in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with laringitis, and unfortunately he is unable to perform."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at the Hydro Square will take place on November 21.
All tickets for this show are valid.

Pope Francis will appoint the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will bring new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest priesthood in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who choose the Pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after he has reached the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the Pope’s elections – this is the prerogative of a group of 120 “cardinals-electors”.
Publishing this news, Vatican’s spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all present cardinals, known as the Consistory, will be held before the sanation ceremony.
“Pope Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to call a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices organization said the number of cardinals voters is likely to decrease by February.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to reboot the number of cardinals-electors to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
Consistory will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
There is a kind of prejudice for Europe and especially for Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a low number of cardinals.
They will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the Francis Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to which it is assigned to seek ways to reform the church.
In the past, the father decided everything by himself.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that it was “fullly possible” that Francis would address the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in such a situation before, it’s all for us for the first time.
Valero said the popes were usually raised to the post of cardinal of bishops from the large parishes, but Francis was “filled with surprises – so we don’t know who he will call.”
GM resigns a number of new pickups in the U.S. for repair of seats
General Motors Co. recalls 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickup models to solve problems with manual seat inclination regulation, according to a Friday announcement from U.S. automotive safety regulators.
On some of the picapes, the front seats may have a defect in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards on the headlines.
"When a car crashes in the back, the headline may not properly protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury," the National Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement posted on the website.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The production of the GM pickup began in June and is the most important launch in serial production for the leading U.S. car manufacturer since its restructuring due to the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM the pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Traffic Safety Administration could not consider the notification to the owners in connection with the government’s 16-day cessation, which reduced the growth of car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday to $37.47.
The cry of despair of Obama's voter
I’ve voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for a possibility of change
He says that Obama allowed the Republicans to obstruction their praise efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as a justification for problems with the Obama-reformed healthcare system website, drone attacks
The memories of the 2008 Obama campaign are a sad reminder of what could be
Natalie P. Morris is a student of the second course of the Harvard Medical Faculty.
I read a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in the times of disappointment at the second course of the Faculty of Medicine and rebuild a sense of hope in me.
It’s called “The Fear for Victory,” and it’s memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I end up writing reports on my patients in the evening and lie in bed, this book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches could capture the spirit.
The victory in the election was impressive, and the leading news programs took a break to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying from joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could only find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
During Obama's entry into office in 2008, his support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is a brutal awakening, like a retreat from a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism – they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of the missed possibilities.
In the years that have passed since I dropped my first electoral bill, the changes have actually occurred.
That was something I couldn’t even imagine.
I give Obama the duty for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the abolition of the rule “Don’t ask, don’t speak”, the murder of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and closing the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after countless times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it from colleagues and colleagues, I had the explanations I can provide.
I reached the point of political disappointment.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain permission for foreign leaders to be heard or drone attacks on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data about the privacy of the Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of the disclosers that reveal the illegal actions of the government.
He cannot explain the murder of the American citizen Anwar al-Awalaki without trial and investigation or non-compliance with the limits of state funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since the time of Nixon’s administration.”
And recently it cannot justify the fact that it is unable to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on available medical care.
I don’t know if I had to expect that.
Should I, at the age of 18, realize that the leadership could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is obvious that the election work is not a predictable program of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and such random events as a battlefield in Newtown.
Nevertheless, from all the examples I have listed above, it is clear that they were largely their own choice by the administration.
And that’s what worries me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
The myth of Romney was an incomprehensible and gross alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policy or views.
I thought that in his second term, when Obama was released from the pressures of future elections, he would justify the hopes we have heard about for so long time.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45 percent this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
This causes me to be overwhelmed by many promises that have gone away.
This week I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton caused Obama a tremendous defeat in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting on the analysis of the causes of the failure, he told his employees that they should return to normal course and remain faithful to their goals.
“I want us to return our attractiveness,” he said.
We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbotta has a conflict of interests in the issue of child care leave.
Billionaire deputy Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbotta has a conflict of interests in the issue of child care leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unregulated dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax, made this statement when he tried to get rid of the questions about whether he had a conflict.
The United Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in the decision to abolish carbon emissions and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and said Mr. Abbott’s daughters would personally be in profit from political measures.
“He has a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid child care leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get a leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially announced Mr. Palmer the winner in the struggle for a place from Sanshayn-Cost of the Fairfax Electoral District with a overweight of 53 votes after the counting of the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting process in the election to accelerate this process.
The daughters of Tony Abba Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be made two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have such a system that we can come, enter your data into the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 18:30 the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of candles for notes in newsletters.
Is it because they can delete the result if someone doesn’t like it?
Using a pen in our time seems strange.
The election committee is exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion document with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old Mr. Palmer said his program includes an international airport for Sanjay-Cost and he would "very seriously" take his new work.
State office is a service to society.
“We’re not getting any rewards except the thanksgiving of history for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily dismissed two traders in its currency operations division, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global check by regulators of alleged manipulations on the currency market is rapidly gaining turnover.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they collaborate with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be removed during an ongoing investigation, which is called for a scandal related to the manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
Refusing to comment on the removal, the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information from the regulatory authorities.
“Our current investigation on this issue is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS transmitted the records of e-mails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to the UK regulatory body, the Financial Activity Control Board (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as it is known, he was given a vacation for his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any violations.
Mr. Asher's contact group included banks from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS bank this week that it took measures against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it is investigating alleged currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies in the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss anti-monopoly body Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Monetary Administration of Hong Kong — are considering claims that banks have entered into a conspiracy to impact the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal inspections or received requests for information from the regulatory authorities, said persons familiar with the situation.
Banks are reviewing instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of crimes.
The news of the checks has scattered traders in the field of activity, which in recent years was one of the largest sources of revenue of the trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility reduces the favourable opportunities for the contractors.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation, saying that an extensive and high liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very small price.”
The news came the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had dismissed one of its London Stock Exchange stock exchange trader this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are sure that the trader was acting alone and that this issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court Approves Obama’s Health Law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s symbolic health law is constitutional, which is a major victory for Obama’s administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges ruled that the separate provisions of the law on patient protection and affordable health care, which require citizens to acquire medical insurance before 2014 or pay a fine, are constitutional in accordance with the government’s taxation powers.
Chairman of the Supreme Court John Roberts applied to four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against.
The court also left in force the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the health care law require that the states increase compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid program, otherwise they will lose all federal funding of the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutionally compulsory.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was firmly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mit Romney.
Football is the cause of disagreement.
In the State Duma, within the framework of the "Open Tribune", politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because of this game - some scandals and disagreements.
Speaker Sergey Naryshkin reminded of the recent events in Birmingham and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in society" the policies and the media should be correct in the statements.
Probably, he meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the television broadcasts threatened to surround the Caucasus with a cylinder if they don’t want to limit the birth rate there.
All the speakers talked about the measures to regulate the migration from the CIS countries, and the measures to harmonize the relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion subconsciousness.
Maxim Grigoryev said the events in Birmingham were "a model conflict that could be forecasted", but "for these questions we have too many people and instances responsible", and seven grandchildren have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced in relation to migrants, in the opinion of the public, has failed, and it is necessary to look for its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov has placed great hopes for a new single book of history.
“We still need to create a support for the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that the students in Tatarstan know that for people they live in Dagestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed a criminal liability for the "calling to the dissolution of Russia": "If in the U.S. you say by radio that you should give to Alaska Russia, you will be arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried to “do not burn.”
As usual, in all, he accused journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public discussion: "In the dust of polemics, there is little to say!"
The leader of the "United Russia" faction Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "papers" and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then the same commitments can take on the politicians.
We have approved about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
As an example, he introduced a law that imposes on regional and municipal authorities the responsibility for the international peace on their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko has not divided the enthusiasm about this law: it has no "clear ideas about what is the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and boundaries.
Thus, the subjects will treat different amounts of these powers.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the staff needed to solve such complex issues, there are no means, and the methodical recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nations Affairs, Gajmet Safaraliyev, proposed the creation of a special department with the terrible name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar department, which was later abolished, opposed.
It is enough to have on the federal level a special person, a "ministry without a portfolio", to whom it would be possible to apply if so.
“We’re walking along the coast, missiles rush around, it’s very important for the representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work must receive decent information support,” said RPC’s representative for relations with society, Vesvolod Chaplin.
No neutrality of the state to dangerous ideologies, including religious, should, in his opinion, be.
Here Oleg Nilov brought the discussion into an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to be sought, but they are pushed not to that way, not to that way," he said.
"It's not the way" - it's the development of football: "This footballer is killed by the whole crowd, then the flags burn, then the comrades with stones throw each other away.
Maybe we don’t need this football?
There is another kind of sport – rugby is called...
"They will not be equal in the world in this form of sport!" - he said hotly.
No one will play in the rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately interfered.
You’ll offer Kerling to them!
We need to know the national characteristics, it’s all the same as the Georgian “Zaporožec” to offer.
In Yaroslavl, the wild behavior at the tribunes distinguished representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football is forbidden throughout the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryanz, said that the "Cuban" was penalized by 500 thousand rubles, reports from the Football House the correspondent "SE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for burning the Dagestan flag by fans at the tribune during the home match of the 14th round against Angie.
At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We examined all available materials.
For the unlawful behavior of the viewers "Cuban" was punished by 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung, and Huawei have been charged with Nortel patents.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, submitted a whole series of patent lawsuits against mobile phones manufacturers, including Google, the price of which it overturned at the Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare search keywords on the Internet with their corresponding advertising, the claim says that is the foundation of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that operate on the Android operating system from Google, which is strongly competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel patents at an initial price of $900 million.
Google has several times raised the offer price, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this deal the determining factor was partially the patent library of Motorola.
“Despite the failed attempt to acquire at the auction patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit says.
Rockstar demands increased compensation from Google as it claims that the breach of the patent rights by Google is intentionally, according to the claim.
Egypt's first freely elected president to swore
Muhammad Mursi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised "new Egypt", when he swore, to become the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was dismissed 16 months ago.
On his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the collapse of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore to 18 judges in black clothes in the court building on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said during a ceremony showed live on state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have put the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of its 84 years of existence was prohibited by an organization serving as a target for the harsh actions that changed governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Mursi arrived with a small cortex shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered near the court building to welcome the new president, and, unlike the Mubarak presidential pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his car column on a typically vibrant road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was laughing as the uncharismatic "back wheel" of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown sharply from the moment of his victory and Friday's speech in which he tried to imagine himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to bring to the end the case of the 2011 rebellion against the autoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, dressed in a blue business costume with a red jacket, told judges in a wooden panel hall where he took the oath.
Later Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he had to speak his inauguration speech.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra performing the state hymn, during which he stood on the stand “smirely”.
The military officer, Feldmarshal Hussein Tantavi, was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and people – one hand”, which was scandalized by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a county of secular education, the University of Cairo in the 1970s became a county of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic swear on Friday on the Tahrir Square, where the rebellion that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year was born, and promised to return the powers of the president, whose position was deprived by the military council, which took the case from the overthrowed leader.
But having agreed to take a formal oath before the court, not before the parliament, as it is accepted, it performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech on the Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Association of Machinery Makers of the Tumen Region took place at the basis of the Yalutorov Motor Factory.
In the framework of the event was presented a new line on the production of electrical welding pipes from steel.
As said the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Grybanov, in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing research was conducted on the study of the market of the sale of steel structures in the Tumen region.
It was revealed that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electrical welding pipes per month.
After that, a decision was made about changing the factory profile and installing equipment on it for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of produced products have been shipped this year.
Investments in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rubles, said Denis Grybanov.
A new building was launched in October, allowing the range to be increased.
The factory is produced as a small tube profile, which is used for the tap-personal farming, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, as well as a large - for the construction industry.
We are planning to get to the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will make up about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tumensk region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased – now it is 157 people, in plans when purchasing new equipment – an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is re-training staff, and the necessary specialists are selected from the already available.
The next year is planned to introduce a new unit of stainless steel cutting with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another station, with a pipeline production speed up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014 the enterprise is planning to acquire the production of pipes that are used in the housing and communal economy.
The company’s leadership puts the task of closing up to 70 percent of the Tümensk region’s demand for this product.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the manufacturing managers, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machinery enterprises.
This is aimed at the forms of state support for the industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and costs for its lease.
In the current year, 150 million rubles are planned to be allocated to these goals, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last committee, which will examine the subsidy contracts, will accept documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget will reimburse the costs for the participation of local producers in international fair.
For the next year the budget provides funds of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to participate in the festivals, 3 million to energy savings programs.
The funds are reduced to 72 million rubles for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tümensk region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, as the motive for its introduction was the compensation of the mining tax that oil companies paid in the regional budget.
Currently they do not do so and subsidies are becoming a direct spending commitment of the region.
Given this, the government of the region considers priority the direct support of industrial enterprises, not the financing through them of the oil industry.
The budget will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many corporate managers expressed concern over the upgrading situation in their relations with the oil producers.
The dotation of the equipment they buy is a competitive advantage of the industry in the south of the Tumen region, and with its cancellation it will be difficult to compete at the price with the average line of Russia, where the cheaper labour is.
In addition, the question is unclear with the continuity of the new owner of TNK-VR - the company "Rosneft", which does not still place its orders on the Tumen enterprises.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvatsky project expires in 2013, and no applications for its renewal have been submitted.
Currently, companies in the southern region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains open whether the taxes from the oil produced in the Uvatsk region will enter the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic Wants to Work 240 Hours for Extremist Video
The Lenin district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work of a resident of the city, who posted a video of extremist orientation on the social network, RIA Novosti on Friday a spokesman for the press service of the district court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted on his page on a popular social network a video that was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Acts aimed at exciting hatred and hostility, as well as to humiliate the dignity of man committed publicly."
“Lenin district court examined the case in a special order and recognized the man guilty of committing the above crime, appointing a punishment in the form of 240 hours of mandatory work,” the agency’s spokesman said.
She added that the man fully acknowledged his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the price of goods after signing the association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decline significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
This he said during a conversation with the readers of his Facebook page.
I can assuredly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU will decrease significantly.
This will mean that the prices will also fall.
"This is about goods that come from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should also be no price rise.
Therefore reports on the billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that association with the EU is a rise in prices, it’s not quite so, or if more accurately, it’s not quite so,” Azarov summarized.
Investigators Check Information About Child Violent Treatment
On October 29, the media published a message that the educator of one of the children's gardens of the city of Bysk for educational purposes locked the child in the basement.
Currently, the investigators are identifying all the circumstances, as well as a legal assessment is given to the actions of children's garden employees.
After the accusation of stupidity, Yevgeny Vasilyev spoke
Yevgeny Vasilyev, whose person has been attracted the attention of the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press both about the robbery in the Ministry of Defense and about her personal relations with the former defense minister Anatoly Srdyukov, her poetry and the passion for valuable things.
However, on the 1st of November, the figure of the "Defense Service" case violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyev said: “In the beginning, of course, the task was just one: to get out of me any negative information regarding the former defense minister.”
There was a chantage on the subject that I should give testimony, otherwise I will be sent to jail.
So far, these threats have stopped.
We will go to court and prove our innocence.
We are 100% confident in the victory.
At the same time, from the interview you can make the conclusion that,, the most of Vasilyev’s words about that she doesn’t matter with taste.
Probably, it is meant the statement of the official representative of the SCC of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of images, which was collected by the figure of the "Defense Service" case, found falsifications.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the master, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art-scientific examination assigned by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they have no artistic value and, simply, are cheap falsifications,” Markin said in early October.
Pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defense.
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal points?
I think it’s just an infinity,” says Vasilyev.
At the question of whether she acknowledges her guilt even in one of the 12 criminal episodes imposed on her, Vasilyev said: "Naturally, no.
Recognize nothing at all.
Furthermore, there is no damage to the Russian Federation.
They just put people into misconduct, that’s all.
Furthermore, in response to today’s statement of the Court of Justice of the Russian Federation that Vasilyev is avoiding the study of the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the figure said that he and his client “the investigator does not give acquaintance with the materials of the case.”
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyev, who is under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Per, how could a woman not fail to respond to the accusation in bad taste?
Or are the "Komsomolki" journalists right, who claimed a couple of days ago that she "falled into an even greater trans under domestic arrest" because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the family's loon?
The famous military observator of the "KP" Viktor Baranetz in his article "Hardyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "The investigators do not exclude that after such a shock she may become more conversational on interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyev was accused of illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.

Do you think travel agents have gone into the past thanks to the internet?
In the Flight Centre, it seems that there is a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year revenue forecast and expects record revenue from residents in Australia and the UK.
This tourist company now expects its main total annual earnings before taxation to be from $325 to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If the current guidelines are achieved, it will be a 12-17 percent increase compared to the record $290.4 million profit in 2011/2012.
CEO Graham Turner said that Flight Centre received 8 percent profit in the first half of the year and started the second half with good outcomes, especially on Sunday trips to Australia and the UK.
“For the period from the beginning of the year, we’re working with profits across our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record-high profit over the whole year before the calculation of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“There are Australia and the UK, which generally bring us the greatest profits.”
In Australia, the travel business has recovered in the second half of the year, compensating a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the business Flight Centre in the field of flight went well, while corporate customers spent less.
Her business in the U.S. compensated losses under the seasonal weak first half of the year, and it is expected to get profits for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, the Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20.

In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who was brutally disputed with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the New Region in the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, on the eve of the day in the Kirovsk district of the Ural capital after the fire was stumbled in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on the street of Uralsk, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
The persons of the dead were soon identified.
It was revealed that they are sisters, one of them is a 44-year-old resident of Yekaterinburg, and the second is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The burned apartment was removed a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under personal control by the chief police officer of the region Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities process various versions of the murder, check the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons inclined to such acts.
In addition, it is determined for what purpose the women removed the apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom theyined relationships.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, orphography and grammar
School courses of English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare's piece, a novel of the nineteenth century, romantic poetry and contemporary British art literature from 1914.
The exam will also present “out-of-program text” to encourage more comprehensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to pass a separate language graduate exam, with persistent recommendations for the choice of English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is expected to release new curricula in English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects subject to radical review.
It will make changes to other main subjects next year.
The separate regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present the revised structure of high school graduate exams, with a new system of assessments and a smaller volume of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gow said that "a broad consensus has been reached that we must reform our exam system to restore public confidence," insisting that school graduate exams will be "more complex, more ambitious and more strict."
Studies show that English schools spend less time in mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore students spend about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirement to spend more time on the schedule of mathematics will not be, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduate mathematics exams in combination with an increased rate in the ratings table will most likely serve as an incentive to provide schools with additional education on this subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-life tasks”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Hague will cost tourists at 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow, tourists will start driving boats on airbags.
For those who want to travel to China this means additional expenses.
Tickets to Puma are traditionally much more expensive than a heat ride.
As in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of the usual ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
Passing through the room of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
To say, this season the tickets did not travel: at the same price the pumas carried tourists in the past spring, and a year ago - in the autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rates are insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the pace of growth of its GDP is insufficient for the Russian Federation and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of loaning the business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation.
We planned an increase in GDP in the area of 3% this year, maybe even a little more.
It will be a little less than 2%.
In the background of the recession in a number of European countries it seems not very bad, but for us it is little, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries as a whole, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies and Russian business receive normal loans at a normal price – this is the first thing you need to do,” he said.

Travel through dirt, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. George Bulle provides free medical care in the rural area of Cameroon
Bulle and his team spend almost every weekend, receiving hundreds of patients.
In this West African country there are not so many doctors — only one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. George Bulle is one of CNN’s top 10 characters in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him the Hero of the Year of CNN.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
Over the course of 21 years, George Bulle saw his father returning to life and again falling into unconscious state, walking through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Bulle was injured in a 1981 car crash near Younde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken hand, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon,” George Bowl said.
If we had the money, we would take it out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bulle accompanied his father for years in overwhelmed clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” said Bulle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and go to the hospital to be the first, but you are no longer the first.
Patients are a lot.
Some may die because of what they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Paul's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor per 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroons could go to the doctor, many of them would not be in the pocket.
Two out of five people in this country live beyond the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the health expenditure in it is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bulle said.
And because of poverty they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Having seen the suffering of his father and many of his fellow peoples, Bulle became determined to do something with it.
Last year, Dr. George Bulle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital of Younde.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes travel to the countryside over the weekend to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people get into the trucks, attach medical equipment to the roofs and go through the crossed area to visit those in need of help.
Not always the luck accompanies them.
Several times they had to pull the cars through the rivers and the dirt.
But when they come, they meet them as real heroes: it’s a festival with songs and dances and the best rooms that only the locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is really a reason for the holiday, and Bowl with its wide smile and unlimited energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” Bulle said.
They come from the entire district in a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come by foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get costumes, gifted glasses or free birth certificates – documents required for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in the school building, municipality or house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative zone to release a place for the next person.
Using the generator to light operational and sanitary equipment, Bowl and its volunteers work until the early Sunday morning.
This is a impotent pace, but the goal of the brigade usually helps to support rural musicians.
“They strike the bubbles all night so that we can stand up and continue to work,” Bulle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade are returning to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their help may be of great importance for those they help.
One man explained that the free surgery he received to treat the hernia will allow him to work again.
“This will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these clinical weekends and work at the hospital, Bulle’s surgeon also works overnight in private medical clinics around Younde.
This second work, according to him, provides 60% of the funding of his non-profit organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Mellie, a second-class doctor at the Dracell University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bowl group.
He is always either in the hospital or tries to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can be continued.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Mellie, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bowl in accomplishing his tasks, this is an opportunity of practice that they would never get at home.
“We got the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood spots or keep tools for Dr. Bulle,” O’Melle said.
As a secondary student, you would never have such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay themselves for their trip to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medications.
But when they arrive in Younde, their food, transport and training is paid by Bulle.
“He’s a hero without a doubt,” O’Melli said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bowl, almost constant workload is not a hard test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill the promise given to your father is what brings him greater joy.
“I’m so happy when I’m doing this job,” Bulle said.
I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can help.
Snowden agreed to give testimony about Merkel's hearing
The Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met in Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the German Prosecutor's Office in the case of a possible telephone hearing of the German Chancellor by U.S. special services.
Snowden expressed the willingness to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, — said Hans-Christian Strebelle, — that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal around U.S. spy programs.
The Senate intelligence committee approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makay at a press conference on the results of the meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, reports the correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening the Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the authorities of the state administration of the two countries will provide comprehensive assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other," Vladimir Makay said.
He stressed that the government of Belarus will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide the maximum support.
The Minister also said that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, according to which the protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a roadmap of the Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade-economic and investment areas, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as to find new forms and directions of cooperation.
“The protocol of the last meeting is fully implemented and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners,” he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said at the negotiations heads of foreign policy departments of the two countries decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The trade between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, needs to be increased and brought to the indicator of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be developed further, as there is unused potential in this area, he says.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that they will further strengthen and expand in the future.
And all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and the Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” Ahmet Davutoglu said.
Obama refuses to say about healthcare
In the middle of the storm of criticism, President Obama went on the fool over his frequently repeated, unclear promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Having seen hundreds of thousands of people receiving notifications about the cessation of service from their providers, the Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for making the American society misleading.
Obama has somewhat rejected his original public promise.
“Most people who have a medical insurance that works can retain it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In spite of what he called a “news revival” about the cessation of services, Obama called on the Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You will get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said no one should be surprised that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required in accordance with the law on affordable medical care.
“Let me say directly to these Americans, you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a speech before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who guides the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said the launch of the online sales site is going “very badly” since October.
“I’m angry and angry just like everyone else,” she said.
I really want to restore your confidence.”
Angry Sibelius rejected the phrase captured by a microphone, a assistant sitting behind her at yesterday’s hearing in the house after a hot debate with Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she is obliged to join Obama’s health program.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long again urged Sibelius to explain why the “architect” of the law on affordable medical care voluntarily did not give up the government-sponsored insurance to acquire a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt agency has deprived the status of the media for non-censored defense.
On 31 October, the Mosgorsk Court decided to recognize the invalid license for the registration of the Rosbalt agency.
At the deprivation of the agency of the status of the media, Roskomnadzor insisted - for systematic and severe violations of the media law.
In the course of the trial, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, actually refusing the publication in the right to raise contradictions.
What is “Rosbalt”
The "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the subsequent years, the agency opened its second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has been developing and functioning as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the middle of the 2000s, the agency was in the list of the most recognized private internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency’s exclusive publications consisted (and still) of notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.
Discussions about the proximity of the edition to the force structures continued throughout the agency’s existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favour of such assumptions, it was said that the project was headed by Natalia Chaplina, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, the role of Chaplina in the leadership of "Rosbalt" is not clear to the end: most often it is called "project manager".
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonin, the chief editor is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, "Rosbalt" did not figure in the federal media ratings - neither by citability nor by the audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the ranking of the visibility of the sites of Russian media according to the version of LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are notes about the impotence of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the solist of the group "King and Shut" and the pograms in the capital, Birmingham.
The "Rosbalta" conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law entered into force, prohibiting journalists from non-censorship.
The agency found the forbidden vocabulary in two videos published on the agency’s website (“Gigit from Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot damned oil heights”).
The other sides are described differently.
On the basis of the videos found, Roskomnadzor accused Rosbalt of a brutal and systematic violation of the media law and appealed to the court with a request to pick up a license from the agency.
The "Rosbalt" stated that the claims of the department were unlawful: first, the videos were not editorial materials, second, the mother words in them were masked, and third, immediately after the warning the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor's claims at the World Court - and when the Mosgorsud on 22 October 2013 adopted Roskomnadzor's claim, the consideration of these complaints continued.
However, already 25 days the world judge made a decision not in favour of "Rosbalt": the chief editor Nikolai Ulyanov was accused of violating the Code of Administrative Crimes and was punished by 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each roll.
Obviously, this has predestined the outcome of the hearing in Mosgorsud - if we give up the thought that the outcome could be predestined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to recognize the Rosbalt registration certificate as invalid, actually depriving the agency of the status of the media.
It can’t be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by the Deputies of the State Duma (the application on behalf of the head of the Roskomnadzor Alexander Jarov on 10 October signed by 26 Deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the KPRF).
The unlawful closure of the publication was declared by the head of the Union of journalists of Russia, Vevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the chairman of the Presidential Council on Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the management of the Roskomnadzor even provided him some guarantees that the matter will not come to the withdrawal of the license.
The court on "Rosbalt" showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be the media in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroys chemical equipment
Syria has destroyed all the claimed chemical weapons production capacities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons recognised.
This first stage of disarmament Damascus completed a day before the established deadline.
By November 1, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities intended to prepare combat poisoning for use.
The destruction of the reservoirs of poisoning substances or their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014.
According to the OCHO representative, the poisoning substances are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the US.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time – to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons – and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production powers will now be carefully monitored in order to prevent their repair.
The next wave is mid-November: at this time, the OECD and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy the already available reserves of poisonous substances.
A lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly checked by the Western intelligence services.
They are prepared to advise the inspectors for new facilities to check if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not fully revealed.
The US believes that the attack was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is a matter of the hands of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or put all the power to produce missiles, poisoning gases and fluids and to fill the missiles with these substances.
Now that this phase has passed, the next step must be the destruction of the already available chemical weapons in the Syrian army.
It is believed that this arsenal may contain more than 1000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisoning, skin-myrtle gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
To destroy it, it is necessary for the OECD and the Syrian authorities to first agree on a schedule of action – it takes two weeks to do so.
OZHO’s head of field operations, Jerry Smith, told BBC that his inspectors “personally observed the destruction of equipment.”
“They now have no possibility to carry out further production or mixing of chemical weapons,” he said.
The inspectors visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and checked that the missile and poisoning plants were either destroyed or destroyed.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out inspection there, the document says, but the equipment from there was transferred and verified by OCHO specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "specially difficult", as work had to be done under the conditions of continuing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the OCHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, the time to celebrate this was not yet found in the inspectors - they were too busy with work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the U.S. spy "goed unlikely far"
John Kerry demonstrated a mild tactics to protect U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases U.S. spying “goed unsuitable far.”
The Secretary of State also acknowledged he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, that he was “on the autopilot” during the appearance of Edward Snowden’s loud disclosures about the NSA’s spy activity.
These information leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on a video on the open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually perceived some things happening on the autopilot because such a possibility has already existed – both during World War II, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, September 11.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying went too far, but stressed that no rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone unappropriately far.
And the president is full of determination to light this issue and to explain it to the people, and now he is conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse against innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the ANB acted with good incentives and that his monitoring operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to explode themselves.
There is a radical extremism in the world, unconscious and full determination to kill people, explode people, and attack governments.
And if you were able to catch it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented aircraft crashes, buildings explosions and the killing of people because we were able to know about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to help solve issues related to alleged U.S. spying abroad and convince Europeans about the need to continue joint anti-terrorist actions with the U.S., Senate subcommittee chairman for European Affairs said Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he talked with members of the European Parliament and other persons this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to disappointment in connection with the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of U.S. national security, it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters with regard to our joint anti-terrorist efforts,” Mr. Murphy, who is the first term in office and is the chairman of the Senate’s subcommittee for international relations for European affairs, said in an interview with Washington.
“And I’m going to Europe to let them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
The news that the NSA has collected millions of records of telephone conversations in Europe has deteriorated relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflect the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies gathered and which they shared with the U.S.
In other disclosures, Snowden’s documents show that the NSA was monitoring the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phone of about 34 other world leaders.
National intelligence director James Clapper defended spy activities against allies as necessary and said it was a normal case on both sides.
In the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office is organizing a visit of Congress members, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes that members of both parties and both chambers will be part of the delegation.
The names of the other participating legislators will be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program is still in the development phase.
While Murphy said that the goal of the trip is to promote the improvement of relationships, he said that some degree of “hardness from the best incentives” will also be manifested.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programs they have used for many years.
“While we can change our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is expected to go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to solve the problems of hostility towards the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
New public surveillance committees will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new compositions of public observation committees (UNC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbies will increase their influence.
Public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of imprisonment.
The affairs of Sergey Magnitsky and Leonid Rozozjaev, the annoyances in the Copy colony - it is through the UNC that the majority of the resonance incidents are announced behind the grid.
For the control of the UNC, there is a struggle between human rights defenders and the lobbyists of the forces.
At the meeting of the OP Working Group on the formation of the UNC I proposed to make the criterion of selection experience of human rights activities.
“He was not accepted, and the lists were formed, without developing criteria,” Valery Borschev tells.
Borschev is the current chairman of the Moscow Observatory Commission and the Association of Independent Observators – the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders engaged in prison issues.
As a deputy of the State Duma from "Apple", he developed a law regulating the activities of the UNC.
The OP Council should vote for the UNC in 43 regions of the country.
More than 1,800 vacant seats are claimed by less than a thousand aspirants, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions were unable to be organized because of the absence of candidates.
The OP promises to organize donations for vacant places.
The UNC of Moscow is one of the few committees with the competition, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 will be 40 participants.
According to Borchev, in the current composition of the capital commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 forces, and in the version, which is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to enter the capital commission.
However, the representative of the "Battle Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin can enter the new composition again.
He has been a member of the UNC for three years, but has never visited the prisoners.
Borschev believes that the forces, by appointing their Chairman of the UNC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
According to them, the promotion of the forces is coordinated by the member of the UNC Anton Tsvetkov, head of the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defences the interests of the forces departments.
“I don’t eat babies for lunch,” said RBC Daily Anton Cvetkov.
He denies that he lobbies the promotion of any lists and says he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opponents.
According to Cvetkov, he was not even interested in which list are now voting in the OP.
The publication of Borchev information he considers a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk UNC.
Her former leaders will be removed due to the last year’s Copay tensions.
The public house concluded that the management of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the UNC Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to forces.
From the new lists, the local commission’s humanitarian chairman “propalled”, but one of his opponents appeared, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
The lists of Moscow and Rostov committees Borchev considers "the place for Copaysk."
The revelations of Hope Tolokonnikova did not affect the UNC Mordovia, which is considered "powerful": only one human rights defender wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council Nikolai Svanidze told RBC Daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is angry by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the board.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted for, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Coordinated the preparation of the lists of the UNC Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Gryb, who is also a collaborator of the Scientific Research Institute of the FSIN.
Grib told RBC Daily that he does not consider it appropriate to divide candidates into human rights defenders and forces and does not agree that the chairs of the committees have sufficient powers to prevent the work of its members.
Grip does not take to predict the results of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a amended option will be issued for voting in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for false claim that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to a sentence and was released under guarantee.
Steve Rochel Bampford was originally convicted on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court in filing a false lawsuit after the Thai police that a local taxi driver committed an attack on Sunday night on June 10, while two other men arrested her.
However, video surveillance cameras later revealed that she successfully returned to her hotel after breaking her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police had interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted that she had made the story.
Before the court, she was kept in local police chambers.
Bampford was sentenced to a 15-day imprisonment in the detention center of general prisoners in Phuket, rather than a female adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for her daughter.
Tanks told Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely worried” about the well-being of her daughter and waited for her return to Australia.
“It’s obvious that it’s been an anxious time, but we hope she’ll come back home as soon as possible,” Tank said.
Bampford appealed against his sentence and was released with a 50,000-bath guarantee.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her holiday in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand's legal sources that Bamford is currently presenting a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to the fact that the court will extend her sentence to a period of up to two years and force her to spend a period in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian tour agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, which will lead to a justification sentence.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Elticheva", translated into French.
Remember, this is his novel that has been the finalist of four awards: "Clar Polana", "Russian Bucker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the Government of the Russian Federation Prize in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undoubted leader in the present generation of thirty and forty-year-old prosaics.
Almost every publication of his hard, built on the modern life material of stories and stories causes hot disputes among critics of various directions.
It can be claimed that the jointly gathered articles about the prose and publicism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the discussions on the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, the talk is mostly about the fact that its participants understand under the word "literature", how they see the present and the future not only of our vocabulary, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include most articles and reviews from regional media and blogging.
Analysis and review articles are generally given in the abbreviation in the sections "Absacks..."
