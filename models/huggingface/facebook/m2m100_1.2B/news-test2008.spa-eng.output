European inflation slides into food
The accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the vertiginous rise in food prices.
The increase in prices in November was higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, recording - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent, the Union Statistics Office based in Luxembourg announced.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest rate, under the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would provoke an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the 22nd trap: "it is necessary to negotiate" on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, beat the twelve-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation has risen in the eurozone as a result of high food and energy prices.
Wheat quotations increased by 88 percent and soybean quotations reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more was paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching already last month the black gold almost $100 a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from 2.1 percent today to 2.5 percent, while for 2009 it will decrease to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent in the next three to four months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, during the year 2008 the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for early December the support of the Young Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level — 13 percent — in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the secure voters of the parties – due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters – would mean a support of more than two-thirds (an 71 percent) versus a support of a fifth for the socialists (an 20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary seat: their support within the total population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low point – it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who judged the country’s economic situation bad, while another 46 percent believes the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As for the coming year, the majority of the population has a deteriorating situation and only one-tenth expect an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the Prime Minister was performing his duties rather badly than well.
13% of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38% of respondents.
54 percent of the population do not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would participate and another 20 percent said it is likely to participate.
In a comparative way, only 55 percent of the population would participate in "a general election to be held this Sunday" and another 15 percent believes its participation is likely.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is Auchan, Tesco has fifty-folded its prices
The Budaörs gold trade triangle hypermarketsined the average price level rise of 16 percent, with the difference that this year VAT has not been raised.
Posts by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold commercial triangle the daily Napi’s usual Christmas basket, but in all hypermarkets a growth was recorded far above 1,000 HUF.
As in December of last year prices in food supermarkets had already "shown" so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below 9,000 HUF, today they can’t do it even for 10,000.
Napi’s basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest-value basket was 10 573 HUF.
(In the year 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in the filet of duckfish, the nut and the seed of amapola.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found one kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not lower the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with a two-litre redemptive bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi’s basket, Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi’s basket.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket last year with that of the cheapest basket this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest last year and the most expensive this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year in prices the increase in VAT was felt.
Just this process destroyed trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied to each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that matches the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of Napi’s basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which was higher by 1720 HUF than the value registered in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
Such extremes did not occur this year, as the highest price so far has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price growth was recorded in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets the price of consumer goods grew more than 30 percent.
(H, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some foods of the first necessity recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to Napi’s basket, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst of cases, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, which can impose drastic price increases even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain about the gold commercial triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large amounts, carrying the preserved foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues were formed in the three stores in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that within the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
Many hospitals use disinfectants.
This year, several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene conditions in hospitals, the clogging of the beds and the overload of staff do not favor the control of infections, says the head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago a MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
One injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of the contagion with MRSA and since then it has not been possible to perform an important surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacterium in his body.
As of December 10, this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents have been recorded in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been recorded with certainty, of the rest there is no information.
Nearly two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-produced infections (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is applied overly or unnecessarily to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are transformed into bacteria very resistant to antibiotics and quickly contain in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicemia, primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened bodies, in elderly people or in people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
Infection should not be confused with epidemic, MRSA is only absent – Tibor Nyulasi said – where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, nursing staff treat them in rubber gloves and masks and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are examined in advance to verify the presence of MRSA in their bodies, but infection can not even be avoided in all cases.
It’s not fashionable to take samples.
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor for the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and old-age homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their bodies.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to the public light when visible MRSA infections are already occurring in the patient - said the chief medical department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict orders for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for treating infections and pathological frames.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in the case of ambulant patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Avoid using disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, handwashing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but also in this sense considerable flaws are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplets and by direct contact between people, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the hospital rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced – added Karolina Böröcz – that in the less favorable economic situations hospitals are saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood for infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are met, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is an enormous expense for the National Insurance Fund, so it is fighted in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (among them MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the commander of the police of the XXII district has been made.
It is possible to rule out the possibility that the resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday struck and killed a passenger, was driving drunk or stunned, Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Capital, said on Friday after preparing the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the primary alcoholemia control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then-chief of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle in the Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district struck a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give up the passage when bending.)
The passenger died after being hospitalized.
As a result of the incident, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because the case moved him a lot.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
400 million euros for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit-limit agreements worth a total of €400 million to finance infrastructure in the education, transport and environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of 300 million euros to finance in the Hungarian budget the transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of the Cohesion Funds, of which the parties had previously signed a loan agreement for a value of 100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The €150 million loan agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of €300 million for this goal of Hungary, on the use of the remaining €150 million will be decided later, at the extension of the loan contract.
The parties signed a contract for €50 million for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the Debrecen University’s innovation and research project.
During the talks they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that when Hungary finalised with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will again address the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth €8.4 billion.
The interest on the credits is adjusted to the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a commission for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all of Europe is directed to that previously little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buy in the even cheaper EU market, which will burn up quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred destination for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
The capital Sofia can also be attractive, with commercial and office spaces promising a quick recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers on Black Sea beaches and ski havens.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups – says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old homes in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important.
Chalet buyers are the second category (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital properties is constantly rising, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent.
The rise in property prices significantly exceeds the growth in wages.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, meetings at the level of experts will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts after the emissions reduction period, established in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Currently there are lively discussions on the particular between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to reach an agreement that, compared to the situation of 1990, by 2020, the emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another big topic of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to provide material and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by a board of directors composed of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Fund for the Environment (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
6 percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Hydrology Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
He stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, with respect to the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit to decrease even by 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to undertake commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states committed to comply with an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent from the period 1985-87, which our country will meet, the Ministry of Environment said in a press release.
It is much that is at stake in Bali, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because otherwise, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed for after 2012.In this case, the reduction commitments assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, whose need was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the UN dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2°C of Earth’s average temperature could not be prevented, a fact that scientists say would have inconsequential and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British military units on a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAD) first took advantage of the services of YouTube: special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban, the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are monitored in the Kandahar General Operations Corps, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the Air Force soldiers that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defense registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and published videos of actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos with recruitment targets, but according to the Defense Ministry they also serve to present to the public the true goal of the British army’s presence abroad.
This type of propaganda virtually costs nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - but inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
Americans are making a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recklessly edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, officers speak as much as possible of losses, without presenting however the bloody part of the battles.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the Iraq and Afghanistan battlefields, but the British army has only recently been taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with the free-to-download shooting video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the ministries' Christmas party
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so you enjoy power.
Offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
On the Christmas of the Orphans the sons of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and on the Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers currently performing missions abroad will be invited.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the holiday atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Foment Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the other portfolios' holidays
The MET party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and the six hundred ministry workers are expected to attend approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the portfolio party a Christmas atmosphere will reign, artists will also act and there will be a tombola draw.
The ANF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice Administration (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that employees of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without costume.
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucía on December 7.
The CNAJ of them paid nothing for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s words of greeting and after the dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question of [origo] they: to attend the ball it was not mandatory to wear a suit or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister Monica Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as by the press department - will drink only coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, instead, will simply brush with his colleagues in the Ministry’s classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a Christmas party in its own hall of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget reception will be paid with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year’s reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a short greeting speech by the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments to [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio could not report on the budget of the Ministry’s Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party that will be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The giant strike forces are gathering.
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday – the day the final vote on the public health law will be held – the unemployment will begin.
This will cause great difficulties in transportation, as railway traffic will be completely stopped and up to 13 a.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transportation Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League unions will report on the details of their Monday strike that they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
There will also be a strike commission of the LIGA and the National Syndicate of Machinists that will coordinate the actions on Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating trade unions will strike indefinitely if an agreement with the government is not reached.
This means that – on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law – they did not report on the end date of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the National Assembly’s Monday agenda, it’s also possible that the public health bill will only be voted in the early hours of the night, or at least around midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant transport difficulties: railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning a part of Budapest's collective transport may be stopped and more than half of the interurban bus transport of Volan companies.
Simultaneously, in numerous points of the country there will be closure of half of the roads.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions have announced their strike for an indefinite period, others for a definite period.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railways and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel in the trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 13 o’clock, the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 o’clock, the LIGA Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry Unions will hold a four-hour strike, the Educators’ Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Educators’ Union of 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will go on a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Health and Social Sector Workers’ Union (SDTSSS) that forms part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, for the case of advanced pensions the possibility that occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country increases the risk for the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysing Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from various points of view.
The company's "risk warning" states: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur."
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is probably the provocation of an event of this character – added the representative of the research institute.
They asserted that all this was due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: “The protagonists of public life ceded the public debate of the Gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Gypsy and Hungarians.”
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict outbreaks – they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country".
We are reminded that: from the fall of 2006 the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary has received increasing publicity and momentum, and that since the summer of 2007 there have been numerous organizations in the country that define themselves as "associations of national self-defense".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state," they add.
They stated: all this is produced in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and political parties.
Because highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the perspective of neighborhood relations.
In recent months, in numerous neighboring states the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way to the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive Roma riots that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense”.
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state has remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, the increased risk of ethnic clashes indicates that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that Hungarian Gypsies will also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense – you can read in the Political Capital’s warning about the risks.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, told the news agency: “Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform the public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
It is not always written with red numbers.
In Hungary, the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around holidays - which next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Neither in the United States nor in the United States are celebrations unified.
Hungarian laws make a distinction between national holiday, state holiday and public holidays.
The holidays are mainly related to religious and historical feasts.
Let us celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year, is a holiday – the latter above all so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
During the whole year we have eleven festivals written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and on 23 October, day commemorative of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May the feast of work, on 1 and 2 November we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day festivals the Passover of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often made bridge when before or after the holiday there is a single working day.
In exchange for the weekends so extended, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the party.
This legal norm is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory, however, for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterrupted even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically stops life in the country, since according to experiences, most people "making bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our festivals will coincide with mid-weekends or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in the working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be modified around the work party so that then, for four days in a row, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be working day, so that Friday, May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the 23 October feast: on Saturday, October 18, you will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year during the year-end party you can rest, since from December 24 there will be no work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six small dissuasives to bitter the lives of your colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, sound messages we never receive, innocent lies that pass without realizing: all of them are part of our everyday workplace folklore.
You have to decide whether you adapt to small inconveniences or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
and advice.
Sorry, I forgot to warn you that you have been sought out from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That’s why you didn’t go on a date.
At best, you feel sorry and try to fix the issue, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
The problem is often solved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to bitter explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more annoying than when you want to pick up a document, an office utility or your phone and you don’t find them.
Remember yesterday you put the recording machine on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on one of your colleagues’ tables?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for subtracting their things.
Do not pick up deck or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Are you joking about your colleagues’ personal life?
There is no good way to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t give everyone the information you have about your colleagues’ private lives!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Enter into yourself what you have heard, and do not laugh at your colleague in his absence, even if others also know the things about him.
Do you leave for illness unjustifiably?
When you call the office by phone and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your work, your unbearable tasks, your work by term.
Do not bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicate to them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Tarareos, laughs, phone calls
Are you engaged in your work, but are you suddenly getting ridiculed by your colleagues?
Have you unwittingly heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your tarareos, singing, loud conversations (less when you do them over their head), slanders, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent loudly.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something on time, you’ve forgotten to send an important letter or message!
Don’t mention the chaos eventually reigning in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the mistake!
Ask how you can repair your lack.
Do you feel at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: habit very comfortable for home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Do not be upset, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so demands!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the audience
The car moves slowly in the usual blockade of the morning.
A strange compass sounds on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Increase the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and the previous tones are added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel reproduced Zagar's song Wings of Love.
The national musical life did not malcribe us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks totally different this blockbuster when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little are changing the image and although again the garage-style rock is fashionable, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has demonstrated: there are new things under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the ensemble of Yonderboi until he started his independent career because both can not be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, dance electronic music and pop, he tried to triumph, when he was asked for film soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Season.
The wider public knew the ensemble that at first acted only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album edited in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, able to sell also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they wear this label or not.
The group reacted as they should react: they prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
This title was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer’s old set.
It’s a good reference to the airy, the flying, but in addition to the airy of music, now appeared – in accordance with the spirit and trend of the time – the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenary György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
In the album is included a true hit channel mr2 Petõfi that recently broadcasts from morning to night popular music.This broadcaster brought to the ears of the radio station the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order.)
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new hit, the question arises: what are you performing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a selected audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of casts in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can emerge from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
There not only the fifteen and twenty-year-olds attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we never composed music for the market.
We don’t make music for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the audience, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and did his career rather west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to that of him.
We rather work in team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our work to the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our career in their group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2’s hit list Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard Zagar’s name for the first time in connection with this song.
Have you consciously opened up with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose big hits and sell with these hits our album.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgia of the album and the heavier themes.
HVG.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly – what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a choir in the Gospel style.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good-voiced soloists from our own national musical stage.
Thus was created that six-woman choir – that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh – which was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material from the album, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically at the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very enthusiastic then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice it’t have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the album it looks like the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and not more strongly than the music, so the music not only accompanies their songs.
They are also on the stage at the bottom.
And intentionally ?
B.Zs: They are in the bottom just because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute solist roles.
The song also verses about it, that we forget for a while our ego, who who from where it came and where it goes, let us then let those wings, the wings of love raise us.
I would have wanted to get others to feel the euphoric mood we felt when this song was born.
HVG.hu: Which job did you do the most?
Zs.B.: In musical composition, in fact, no, but when it comes to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray’s Dilemma in which I’m playing on a concert piano or the Rock’n’Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn’t want the groove to work and then, little by little everything came to its place like a puzzle.
Q: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and because I’ve already “left” the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous stock broker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A dishonest man.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French giant banker of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
It lost about 5 billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and,, with good abilities.
He instructed long ago, unlike all the major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character," he told his superiors, who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses, according to French media outlets, such as Le Monde, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than €1.6 billion thanks to his.
Not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said in his replies.
Just in the summer, it managed to earn during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already arrived at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.600 million euros.
"When I already earned my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify it," Kerviel confesses and adds, that he has left nothing for himself, at all.
During the entire interrogation he declared that he had falsified the records in such a way that their discovery was not reached.
He even came to deceive the bosses, even when the Eurex Exchange began to be interested in their business.
Risk becomes profit
Are you afraid it will be discovered?
Rather not no.
"I thought I had earned $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did he get so much willpower to take such a risk?
In my position, work had to be done gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant broker at the stock exchange and in 2005 he became a broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they looked at me cautiously.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first big success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this meant a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you.
“This is like a snowball,” the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
“While I earned money, they closed their eyes.”
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
They lost a billion euros in one day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all trace.
When I got to work on Monday, I wasn’t working at the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of its fault.
How did they locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The rider who doesn’t have a vacation is a rider who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his record,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the potential to get 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs from which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes will provide approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech companies will receive approximately 100 billion SEK from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Program is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.800 million crowns.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
In terms of the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly arrived countries that use them least.
Ex-President of Nicaragua sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday sentenced the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, to 20 years in prison, who was convicted in 2003 for the fraud of $100 billion (almost $1.8 billion).
Despite this, a time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest at his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is unclear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 will be back between reels.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will rather depend on the prison agents if they let German finish his punishment at home or if they return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German constantly transferred money from the government to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictional and the account belonged, in reality, to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 election.
This is how the budget was approved.
It is so.
The state budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first elaborated by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government confidence vote, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view though the most influential, passed the new law quietly.
This is a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and start of the budget, you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The state budgets of the last social-democratic governments suffered from three shortcomings that for this year of 2008 is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the mandators that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first deficit.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the biggest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees and bank credits, often issued, meaninglessly, obligations with which they indebted their municipalities disproportionately.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts through the mass sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
Currently, this resource is not available.
If we only look at the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to put order in the state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to debt.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, economized much more reasonably than our republic.
This is a disgrace, especially in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have in vain been inflated with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform do not change then it will be the end really of any policy in this country and, who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will turn into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That’s why this year’s budget can’t be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending spending from the presidents.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
We do not want the politicians who rule to become only officials, so we must be patient and give this weak government coalition, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and taxes, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be received through bidding.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to bid, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, this is the first time central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group in his report to customers.
“This coordinated action by central banks likely reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks should really be afraid of what awaits them when they decided to take this step,” said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems of accessing loans and will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with different impacts on global growth.
The central banks so decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, a London interbank rate that is used for borrowing money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money even when the U.S., Canada, and UK central banks lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move taken by central banks contributes to sparking the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists’ debates are incredible
Global climate change affects especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism arose now with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There debates are barely structured, they are artificial fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that this is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy for discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, “I often only find myself with the caricature of my ideas.”
Those interested can now be informed about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closing, he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not so big and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
In addition, as an experienced man with totalitarianisms, he considers it unacceptable to impose untested opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that he is not against “reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental militants who do not consider the relationship between costs and benefits.”
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people have failed to change their driving license
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and therefore failed to change their old driver’s license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new license.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid license.
According to traffic, the license has not changed mainly those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of carnés, the metropolitan offices are full of requests and interest in the new carnet has increased.
The city council estimates around 2,000 daily customers.
In the queues wait for half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet obtained the new license.
The issuance of a new card lasts 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the carnet in a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver will have to pay 50 cents.
Drivers who are obligated to change their license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go to the roads without the valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
The police may remedy the infringement with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine could be imposed on the person who does not go anywhere.
It could cost up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry called on the offices to moderate fines of up to 1,000 crowns, at most.
According to Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, the 1,000-couron fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, a driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have.
Those who do not want to drive should provide a driving license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, carnets issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licenses.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the licence issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's complicit detectives
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided to reduce the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives from the Prague Anti-Organized Crime Department were initially sentenced to between 14 and 12 years.
The decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance first.
In other cases, he was sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You cannot receive more.
In January, the district court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the upper court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accusations of the accused were rejected by the investigation because of invented causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped criminal group members to avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The charges refer to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of abusing power as public agents and without a gun permit.
In the home record, police found pistols, ammunition with steel nucleus, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the accusation, stole them tens of millions of crowns.
Except for a dozen men in this process, the court has already found Berdych and other accused guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring of other trials, and in some causes have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have so far avoided the trial, are in jail in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the Czech authorities.
One account for changing a few children: 12 million
For the change of children in the maternity house, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the Třebič hospital 12 million crowns in compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, is not in principle in agreement with Veleba’s proposal.
"Such a request we do not approve, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We will see if it has a rescue value.
We remain in the opinion that they will be hundreds of thousands for all,” Dostál said.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloň family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating the compensation for the specialist’s report, only that it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was best endured by the men although they fought with complaints about the change of the girls.
Women are getting worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba added.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by the nurses at the Třebič maternity house last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový in Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation expenses for the mistake committed at the Třebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reservation fund and extraordinary can ask for help from the administrator.
The court has so far recognized a proportionally low compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinary one million crowns.
Polívka lost the Kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Valaquia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear to the oral audience today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably has not ended and his client will appeal.
"The case is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone comes to the image of the actor and comedian.
Harabiš has the same idea.
“We have about 10 years of work behind us.
Search for money and invention of activities,” he said.
For him, the cause of the plight lies in the money.
“After years I realized that the project is successful and that it could also get something.
They want to live like parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Valaquia brand was first used by Polívka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about directing him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
Some years later, Harabiš was asked to publish the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comic origin it resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš created the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use her name and signature on passports and even offered its holders discounts to visitors to her farm and attendees to her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who have fully devoted themselves to it.
The collaboration, among today's decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment began conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the forever elected."
The main role in the kingdom, by the mediation of Harabiš derived from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his company that has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring into the litigation, the tournament for the throne with their princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out.
He did not want to disclose any more data or dates.
“We have no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king’s way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected at a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can come forward,” Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I never liked the Peugeotu 206.
Its running features were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and to me, I only have to think better.
When I tried the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the head space on the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I go through the inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only disadvantage is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value the invention of design even though the car already looks pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backbones.
Also, unlike the 206 model, the side direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the car have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned shortage of space in the head.
Baggage in the suitcase
But the main thing in this vehicle is its suitcase.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the drop-down rear gate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can extend to the point of attaching heavy objects.
Let’s stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in the basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav’s model, we find out that the Peugeot is behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child’s car, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that remains quite flat after dropping the backbones of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection lighting on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a power of 88 kW.
And to say the truth, this is how it should look like a 1600 that would underestimate the family five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the Škoda era of then that looked like the exhaust pipe was tapped by a cloth, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection lighting of 1400 for 329.900 crowns, still can.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Just that we would still have airbags on the headsets, automatic air conditioning, automatic cleaners, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but it has the team’s add-ons in the Fabia and it’s going to get a pretty similar number.
Now it remains to be decided which of the two marks.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools attend children from Eastern Europe and therefore, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and clashes between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In his defense, he said the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
Police were also forced to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls gave him racist insults and threw him stones.
“When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to leave, he made us throw apples and pears, and then dropped his pants and showed us his back," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the emigrants from eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are registered 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palm trees and all included with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island you can find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything that had crime in the U.S. (and therefore, prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba like drugs, gambling and prostitution.
His guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high buildings emerged, wide avenues were run by cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a fortune in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bowl signed the stars of the world of the spectacle and politicians from all over America.
And today ?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already of the cult of the 1950s to this day continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have oxidized among these wet and salty winds.
Even when Havana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating significantly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and is highly valued by rail enthusiasts.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brother models that there are elsewhere in the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Per, just remember that in the already-cited Hemingway fortune there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone land.
Mogots, pylons of limestone rock and rocks of sharp elevations in the falls of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimated thanks to which rocks form that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest-quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the Havana pures factories you can find your final product.
Per someone finds it interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinity
Old Abolengo city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth turned into beauty with the buildings in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so remote that there was still no road in the 50s of the past century that united it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth seeing interesting places in the surrounding area such as Ancon Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the morning.
Barracuda
A small town in the western extreme of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly this opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that come there from Guantanamo must pass by high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in reality it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, puros, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Santería, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all this could fill many pages.
However, as they say, it’s better to see it someday.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the mission’s progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not resulting as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to be more active, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid as a priority.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own,” Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
The ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels, according to U.S. military data, is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent acts grew by 27 percent compared to last year, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of which are in the south.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We’ll have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we’ll them,” Gates said.
This was stated by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months prevails the controversy of whether all allies do the most in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized.
“The Germans have a relative number of substitutes in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun called the German soldiers vaguely this week.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are engaged in playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt to reach $1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech citizen the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt in September amounted to 842,7 billion crowns.
This year, the government planned to borrow 159.200 million crowns.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152,8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the development of the state budget economy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose at the end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
In the nine months of this year it increased by 40.200 million crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt for early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state borrowed more than 111 million crowns.
“For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year, we could cross the trillion crown limit until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns,” said David Marek, an economist at Patria Finance.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, says: “We could spend the billion during the year 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it was seen that the situation on the political scene changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
Doubts are growing
The state debt creates debt in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
State debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, government bonds, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s internal debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
Foreign debt has so far risen from 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803,3 billion yuan since June was reduced by 13,7 billion yuan.
The average state debt period increased by 6.5 years.
“The total annual debt from the first to third quarter creates 13 percent, which is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the government’s payment and debt management strategy for the year 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to borrow 159.200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with approximately 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns for financing state liabilities and 1.8 billion crowns in payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
He compared today in front of a court in Jartum to have given a name to a peluch bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
She was accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name of Muhammad to a peluch bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was passible of a punishment.
This 54-year-old British school teacher at the Unity High School in Jartum, Sudan, was detained at her home on Sunday and charged with terrorism against Islam and sedition, under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story dates back to the month of September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class’s peluche bear.
"Eight names come out of children's mouths, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting a religious belief, “I’m sorry only that I asked the children to vote for a name,” he said, “it’s just an innocent mistake.”
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as “very attentive to her students” and “never speaking of religion in class.”
The name Mohamed is also the second most spoken name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached on the future status of the province during the last session of negotiations in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, the failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said during a news conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was “at stake”, its American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "evident tensions exist."
End of the mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go to Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was commissioned a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence to Kosovo, insist on a pursuit of negotiations beyond this top date.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
After eight years of the UN administration of Kosovo, the Westerners consider that independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to unilaterally proclaim it if the Security Council does not resolve in its favor.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Baden hotel where these "last-chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his pessars.
But he added that the autonomous plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations".
“Dominant effect”
Serbian President Boris Tadic has, on his part, considered a compromise always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province’s independence.
Belgrade says it fears a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the 1990s independence wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
“The European Parliament will have the last word.”
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations have lasted for two years.
They should end as they started: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made “in concertation” with the West.
Bush launches deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he met on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations toward the peace itinerary they agreed on in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues, without exception, including the central issues."
This designation covers the three main problems of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
As Olmert returned, he pledged that the negotiations will be "direct and continuous" and will make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush fixed at the end of 2008 the deadline for the launch of his “vision of two states” Palestinian and Israeli coexisting.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment in this direction from Bush’s side before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud said in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in this type of events, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the General Inspection of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17, rue Luisa-Miguel, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but in a patrol, and he was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a turning lighthouse," a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, “unhomologated, i.e. unauthorized to drive on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, was circulating “at all gas”.
"He struck the police car on the left side, after a breach of the pass to the right," the police said.
Alcohol controls on the occupants of the vehicle were negative.
The state of the car (the unfounded front, shattered umbrellas, slashed parachutes) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary murder and denial of aid" to the IGPN, joined with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this minimotocicleta came relatively quickly to his left".
Yesterday, a sort of slot, undoubtedly caused by the scratching of the footwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck the time for the police car to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical examination.
Both victims' bodies were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated across Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove "all serious failure" concerning this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, about which one has to be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that followed the accident.
It is one of the windows that shows the scene.
“We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to resuscitate them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a completely disgraceful policeman, who cuddled.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that the people present from the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police departed".
They also practiced heart massage, in vain.
“I will not assume that the police services did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young people were rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was declared two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, 2,000 lawyers protesting the measures taken under the state of emergency have been wounded by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter reacted with stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste to whom they swore before Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise is no longer true"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly referred to the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to decide in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on October 6, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the faults of the Supreme Court," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "values no more" after the instauration of the state of emergency, Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant information minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies are unforeseen.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are unforeseen, a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) reveals, forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception allowed, however, a better “domination of fertility,” according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less per month for a couple of every five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repairs on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his International Space Station crew colleagues will need more than seven hours of work in space to perform the spectacular repair of a cracked solar panel that is indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated records due to its duration, its removal from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "chapuceated" by astronauts to make the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery launcher, a thick cylindrical piece that would soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a type of landing platform for laboratory modules.
You must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity generation module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacing it, the crew began reorganizing the module’s solar panels, which have a length of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which unfold like acordeons, has been damaged in just over a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who at first had to make a control exit from the Discovery launchers, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it’s Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to the end of the 30 meters long remotely driven arm of the launcher added to the station to make the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
High, resilient, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been charged with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed types of “tablets” in the damaged area.
He was helped by the second "spacewalker" who had stayed near the air shutdown and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey minibaston wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "chapuceed" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a midday rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher for their return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in the stock exchange
The EADS stock is currently down sharply at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aviation and defense group has announced it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4 percent to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast of operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the engine development of the A400M, which conditioned the aircraft’s inaugural flight.
The cost to mitigate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the European manufacturer EADS's parent company announced.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that EADS’ operating result failed at 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another program, the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned for a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The Status Quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the outcome of the polls: Russians will massively opt for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration to stability, even to authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is addressing voters a television message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory turns out to be crushing.
Yesterday, the president didn’t let anything clear up by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new burden on the West accused of interference – his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want honourable, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign crushed by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there has never been "so dirty elections, even at the time of Yeltsin."
After the repression of last weekend’s demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unexpected legislative elections there are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for a third consecutive term.
No successor emerged.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
The leader of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful party United Russia who would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, from St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society lagged in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic uproar,” estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “deliberately renounce the personal responsibility” of those who briefly testified after the breakup of the USSR.
“Why to reflect?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite thinks of preserving the statu quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why to reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential character, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far consultable only for a “humanitarian” purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or its right-wingers.
The eleven states in charge of its management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all states has ended, the opening is effective from yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of the forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory labor and, eventually, to provide them with a proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade reaches approximately 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are hoping to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union’s foreign ministers had in April given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free-trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact will greatly dope both economies” and “India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services," Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential."The European Union and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about alleviating the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a £10 billion offer to the base index of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period starting on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market transaction,” it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market as of December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the Bank of England BoE puts on the market liquidities for five weeks in an open market operation.
This is usually done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it is "prepared to take further measures to keep the indexes" of interbank loans on a daily basis with its base index.
The interbank index per day was on Wednesday of 5,829%.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts marketed by the Bank of England were combined to a significant penalty index that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound relative to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of PS's propositions on purchasing power
The UMP group and the Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles in the Socialist purchasing power bill, which equals a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist “niche” (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS’s national office, including an increase of 50% of the surplus wage for employment, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP (internal tax on oil products), a transport check or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that led to sometimes live exchanges between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s television intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the rectificative finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, neither more nor less, the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August at a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Another time known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts annually about 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as our marketplace and we were working with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city center of Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional site that, lately, will take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after being unmarked in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both of these events take place in urban environments.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are performed rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a country festival in the European way and urban in the American way.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the deal, but says “they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, we hope, will have a long life.”
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is “very large,” such as that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been released to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator is opposed to that.
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate – “politically difficult” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the “runaway productions.”
Is it difficult to compete with the “Governor”?
“We have to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find the conditions in Montreal are favorable, go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The race to the festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is, however, the promotion of the cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them courage and make sure that filmmakers make interviews.
The Dark Age took a good picture at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be end-of-year rally on the stock exchange? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks before the closing of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year, experts do not know exactly what this will be.
Banif believes that “from the statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, even more because, in the current context, uncertainties hide in the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not supporters of the stock exchange taking the run in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values both in long and short sections".
For this reason, they believe that the stock market will have a lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility “especially because the impact of the likely decline in the Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions.”
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say there will be a rally.
“It’s not the thing for many joys,” the expert assures.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the highs marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15.945,7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be slightly different this year as he believes the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a reboot of the index that could be pushed depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
Analysts believe they are positive.
Analysts are in agreement when choosing the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that “this year touches the big values.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some manufacturers "because when the date arrives, the electric sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the rises will come from the hand of the banking and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC to follow their same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technology will also do very well although there is not much representation in the Spanish market in this case.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a low month only twice.
The authentic year-end rally was lived in 2003, an exercise in which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the pinchback of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered by 28.17%, December recorded a rise of 6.68%.
It will be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (at the moment the Ibex rises 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 pm, and open on Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to expand the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to make the move.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to point or not to this initiative that seconds the trade hours.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and shops from the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open across Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new opening but remodeling the already existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial zones, adapting them to the profile presented by customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
Commercial banking manager, Ángel Rivera, says this restructuring does not mean a big investment, although a greater hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide hours, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax locations they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
For now, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We have achieved it.”
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
“It’s what hurts me, not because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve fallen less,” he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, “we have fallen less.”
Telecinco ended the day with an increase of 2.54%.
That gain puts its loss in what we have in the past year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday ceded a 1.52% and accumulates a drop of 40,5% since January, costs half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other communications companies quoted amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million Prisa (editor of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this announced data were made real, the television channel would register this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover from 965.4 million in the year 2006.
For its part, Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out it hasined so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is too early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in partnership with its Mediaset matrix.
“We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given value with the 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market shows at these times of some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
This is due to the expected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s earnings forecast by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
Three opinions
1st
Ibersecurities recommends buying both securities based primarily on their high dividend profitability and sustainable long-term potential.
2nd
Caja Madrid: See better Telecinco (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'multiples attractive' and business rise.
Three
JPMorgan: recommends underweighting in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by the Congress of the amendments incorporated to the project in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and consensus the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, means the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Law also obliges investment services companies to disclose information on the market on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management and requires them to carry a record of all the transactions they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage by the Congressional Economy Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it is highlighted that debts titled are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of U.S. high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, it took advantage of the transposition of the directive to legally delimit the functions that diplomats in Economics and Business can develop 30 years after the Royal Decree approved in 1977 that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for another account, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of product marketing and customer acquisition to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonised IPC increases by five-tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to offer data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various methods of statistical modeling to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only orientative, so it does not have to necessarily coincide with the definitive data, which will be announced next December 14.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the rise in 4.1% of the IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time augurished that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of the Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation difference of Spain with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same of the last years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
“We expected a figure around 4%,” the Minister of Economy recognised in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to raise $42 billion from Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen more than 50 percent to £12 billion since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it had record deposits above £25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of the hundred percent of that money that the Government offered and will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trading brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get those remaining 18 billion pounds to reach the target of 30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to its purpose.
Northern Rock has named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as its favorite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot that has been unfolded this week.
In addition, one of the council’s secretaries and the municipal police chief have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then mayor of the municipality, and who, according to sources of research consulted by the SER, could be the head of this plot.
Officers continue to register the municipal dependencies and the Urbanism council and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the letter of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, was charged at the beginning of this week.
As the SER yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore out of place, was stopped by leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions of Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of a urban convention with a Galician construction company to recalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono accepts to head the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in a press conference by the secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting held this afternoon in the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he pointed out that "yes seems" that the Mancheguese politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace as president of Congress Manuel Marín, who made public on November 15 his decision not to present himself to the upcoming general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to devote to fighting climate change in the university.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting for him to return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, just like citizens know who will be the vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or scream" and to make "it look more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunately that the only local in Madrid where you can't talk with tranquility and with ease is the Congress, the President of the Government on a certain occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good doing" and has not wanted to be seen already occupying his position to not fall into what, according to him, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement has subjected to unmerciful persecution both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is forced to show iron coherence.
And a leader of the movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has decisively contributed to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in what sectors it has occurred and why your government, the government of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he explains to the Spaniards with the utmost clarity what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
There has not been, nor will there be, any such explanation.
It is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of and individuals.
Even the penny of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not intend that we travel by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and local police chief arrested in Totana for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the municipality and a hostel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have today.
The edil was arrested at his home and was transferred to the Consistory, in whose dependencies he is at this time along with numerous agents, who have also come to the City Council of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalibration of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable so that the Galician company Nuaria built 4,000 houses, after payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other people were not detained but are charged in the summary, which instructs the No. 1 Court of Totana.
The first three detainees have been brought to court today.
According to the sources, the previous governor of Totana and today parliamentary autonomous PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current girlfriend of the former governor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the group mentioned, and through which the bribery would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the detentions, practiced eleven records, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were reclassified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Viguese parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in Finland’s most important newspaper (by the way head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
“The content of Philosophy’s signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela’s school.
The culprit of the deaths, a bachelor’s student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Counselor of Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy at institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of crimes on Internet downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime with a sentence of six months to one year.
In contrast, if you steal discs in the store for a value of less than 400 euros, it is considered simply a lack (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the penalty imposed on the discharge (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the unload (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous riot is punished with a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. Distribution of copyright-protected films without authorization is more punishable than distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone is getting his hand, a very long hand.

My primary physician gave me one of his articles on rare research titled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.’
That is, that the feelings that the monthly salary of employees generates depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been conducted using magnetic resonance tomography at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognitive Imaging group at the Life & Brain Institute in Germany, “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and their partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when they both hit they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was higher.
I don’t know if it requires so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agridulce taste, because the main responsible for the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed -, former general Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still freed.
His names are on that list of which takes its title the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not premiered in Spain) that, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the criminals fleeing and pressure the governments involved to narrow the siege.
Which insurance is suitable for me?
The car insurance, which covers the driver before possible accidents, represents an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the licence, the civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of the car, among others.
Having a car is only the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in case of accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the car, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely to suffer an accident, the higher the amount to pay.
It is for that reason that both the older 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of accidentality due to their prudence.
In addition, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some type of crash.
As the frequency increases, the chances increase.
There are many variables that insurance companies have in mind when determining the premium price.
This is why the driver must study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages when it comes to contracting insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the licence.
Although the ideal thing to be well insured is an all-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk franchise, so that they get the coverage of an all-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would require the customer to pay a part of the amount of the accident.
"The portion of the amount of the accident that the customer brings will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," said Luis Noguera, the highest responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is assured of protection against damages caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
and a counsel.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the cost of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that base fee.
The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the profit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to increase the bonuses,” Noguera said.
After the age of 25, it is easier for drivers to contract insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to contract a whole risk with franchise.
“Normally, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when taking advantage of an accident, and even when driving,” says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the newcomer’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as their economic situation allows it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of accidentality, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one to all risk with franchise (can be this of 300 euros), or, when you have a high level of bonification, one to third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a greater amount of franchise,” said Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is recommended to have an all-risk insurance with franchise (this being 150 euros), or one to third extended when you have a high level of bonification.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that most suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic are looking for a point in Milan that is worth the octaves.
Milan and Celtic meet on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to judge their ranking.
The Italians add ten points and have already certified in the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives the Benfica, which has four, does not advance him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the entire sixth day ends, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuted on the 13th day in the semi-finals in search of a place for the 16th final.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in the Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected outcome, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and a better crossing in eighth would be ensured.
Gordon Strachan's team could even have a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the milanists will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who are confident to get into eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutive, after they were precisely defeated in that round last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the going.
Expecting the victory of the ‘rossoneri’ will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the triumph, in the event that he loses the Celtic, both to get into eighth and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being the last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 spectators attend Spice Girls' first concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place stadium that the group's meeting is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people exhausted their tickets to witness the concert that included a video in which the story of the group that made furor at the end of the 1990s is.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects their main hits as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls came out on the stage with bracelets that had been given to them by the spouse of ‘Posh Spice’, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd overwhelming the GM Place, despite Victoria’s nerves forbidding him days earlier.
On the eve of the show's start, Victoria Beckham said the British star "hasn't seen our dressing room, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure in 1998 "for the differences between us" provoked the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
“I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m happy to have made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have been fixed and we love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, they were awaited by an army of nurses.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
It will be held in Madrid on December 23.
Further concerns about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s oil exports to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every flight between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom has said it will charge more to Ukraine, as it has pledged to pay 50% extra in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine would pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut gas supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s gas supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply with Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "will have to test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchman said.
The recommendation from auditor-general Robert Black came after it was established that a foreign doctor was related to the June airport attack in Glasgow.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS does not have an exact idea of how much foreign personnel it has.
However, his report noted other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample from five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the amount of foreign personnel hired outside the European Economic Area following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed into the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused in connection with the alleged car bomb attacks in the UK.
NHS hopes to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish health board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The general auditor’s report recommends, among other measures, that the boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal checks in many countries outside of Britain.
"Al we found some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff.”
BMA Scotland president Dr. Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it’s not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the general auditor warned that the number could be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely met.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing foreigners’ pre-employment policy and guidelines at the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was very interested in this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations in the reports and that this will be reflected in the updating of pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – which they had planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And the Bond protagonist, Daniel Craig won the varieties award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film – in black and white – featuring soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was produced for just £3,000.
But the winner was also Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s album Joshua Tree, who won two awards – Best Director and Best Debutant Director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony - such as Julien Temple's film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the prize for best actor for his role as the driver of a London Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The Five-Year-Old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa’s supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 terrorist cell militants who planned an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The world’s largest oil supplier’s state television said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have been mounting a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on a oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia set up a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launcher expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said militants had planned to smuggle eight missiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudi travelers to Iraq from joining al-Qaeda as militants to fight against allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunni.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by the calls of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government — targeted government-associated foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose goal was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unbelievers and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Climate of Venus may give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a Earth twin than previously observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: “It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus started as Earth, possibly with an habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police seize ‘enriched uranium’
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It remains open
Mitt Romney says it’s not worthy that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions in video and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the Republican party debate on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to go up the dial when they listened to ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed peak approvals when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest words of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pioneer in crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation as he was gentle with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing the illegal to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility to obtain citizenship).
Lesser candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the issue.
Neither has the word of being nominated, but both remain in the race because both alerted on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least on immigration, and in general, the candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fears of China’s toxic toys and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics emerged.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether diving should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all expectations, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too clever to be a candidate in the elections.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee rises in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
They both came out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not come to an agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The laborers
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not interesting.
They don’t seem to have sold influences, nor are there exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor are there extra marital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour government party, of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using fake names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister eluded calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence stating that polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative gap.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time employment.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown goes irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after being unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their unbelief when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press seeks bad news; and the government puts itself on the defensive and does not focus.
On one side, Brown’s position is difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to renounce Tony Blair, he was his upper lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the authority registration tax, are related to the decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Erari.
And even when it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s downtime — or “pocket for partners,” political party funding research — voters can assume that if it’s.
However, Mr. Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The boards are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has been killed, nor has anyone been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but it is not his decision.
The anti-anonymity laws for big political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s deal, and that it wasn’t illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraising chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown hasn’t been involved so far: there’s nothing to suggest that he was aware of these acts, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in decision-making for a family affair, an investigation commission on the matter – led, to a great extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent, independent head for the Public Life Standards Committee, as he hasn’t had one for six months, and he must also push for a genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard labor cooperation with the Tories, and a renunciation to the special financial situation with the unions – bitter measures for a party like Mr. Brown.
But he has to face some party facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Shark cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s natural for dorsal alettes to swim excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their gaze on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis contains other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortised or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million in its U.S. consumer financing business, in part due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is too early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American People’s Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represented a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of delay) would be growing again, or it could happen that conditions for lenders were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts emission volumes for the year 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market exist: consumers like to load debts on credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than assets, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in the lender’s creditor capacity.
They can even work to advance the broadcasters.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, payment of card debt rises on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions of mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset overpayment.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief finance officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a contraction of credit pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We need to keep an eye on these dorsals.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility in fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the end of a flooding investigation launched after the Enron collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were that they had warned Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charges against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleged that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the craftsman of a myriad of Enron fraud, which helped its fall spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary interest to zero, but the three British knew it would rise.
A company under Kopper's control bought bank interest from the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two charges of conspiracy in the Enron collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide millions of debt or make its failing look successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market securities and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were charged last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But nobody asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of Gulfstream’s cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer orgia held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from crafted caoba yachts to diamond-incorporated car bars, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche on the stand next to his.”
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.
Fuel supplied by the rise of oil, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same thing in 1890, when some talented Americans came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their portion of the cake.
Somewhere else in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, second-grade riches include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-tanks.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jewellery.
She attends the trade fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon costumes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a network carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that blends brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum feathers, Mövenpick ice cream, swimming pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, the Russians are more interested in ‘bling-bling’.
In fact, sellers said that the richest Russians (10 to 15 years old, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people – cash millionaires, billionaire emissaries or tourists – fill the halls every day.
Some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of the King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cachemire and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car bars in the shape of chain bracelets, for Rolls Royce Phantom, for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with beams embedded in Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels of ostrich leather or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, will not necessarily drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
“He’ll keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars.”
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase “Russian billionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone cabins filled with batches of fake one-million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking pile of money, asking their friends to take photos with their mobile phones while resting on lots of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karryev.
Chapuza Surgery Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the “A little healthier” restaurant and saw an ambulance climbing through White Cape Cod, two doors below on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly a police car appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance get up,” Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, said on Wednesday.
“That was when I knew someone had died.”
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the head of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at Av. West Scott's 212 house.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo’s death, but are waiting for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available until a few weeks.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenaceful,” Mr. McCarthy said about Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my guardian.”
She protected me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and who left behind two children, aged 14 and 11, and a daughters.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Walsh said.
“This is an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not say whether Ms. Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
The researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door in Mrs. Castro’s home, where a marshmallow rosary is located in the front of the house, and a dalmates ladra in the back.
A blue drum labelled “ethyl vanilline” – used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes – was located on the car door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bicycles hanging on crochets on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It is embarrassing.”
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock exchange
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after markets expected the Federal Reserve to soothe credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which rose with reassuring comments from the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
The stock markets relaxed in London, New York and across Europe after Ben Bernanke’s number two chairman, Donald Kohn, declared that policymakers should be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to the continued tension in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid rising credit exchange samples, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October.”
If the uptrend persists, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into the U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as house sales that hit record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset losses from its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those jobs are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at closing to 13.289.40, while the S&P 500 wider index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the close to 6.306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6 percent, and the French CAC40 was above 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the re-emergence of credit tensions in the markets was highlighted after a strong demand for a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the London stock markets, tightened the credit and three-month "Libor" loan rates among British banks, meant the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England tries the lawsuits of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important compared to the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the national team that is on loan – with that particular title at least – is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, England’s director, is beginning to fill up with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part-time.
He who doesn’t get the sixth place will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and the sport too.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for ability.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does it?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should tell what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain’s eye at the same time of taking a “wicket” and a battler to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison claims to “fit and bowls” like the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more from these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become an important player, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia, it can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today’s session at the Asgiriya stadium, will follow their instincts of conservation and favor Shah’s greater experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early 88 in Bombay, 32 centuries of first class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent backgrounds against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two rounds in May against West Indies in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, it seemed to have taken from his “batting” something of it than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living in swords.
He gets caught up for nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he rolled his vehicle on a show for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to say to him with excitement, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, because he beat with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Per that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean that Shah doesn’t stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it’s he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of Syrian and Jordanian refugees who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and what is safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shia militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered a momentary cessation of its troops.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and a professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want the Iraqis working in his country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped pull al-Qaeda out of its bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my and my colleagues’ support.”
“That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops consolidated groups of “concerned citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned due to visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian squads of death.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis in order to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunni have been driven out of Shiite zones and vice versa, relaxing tensions.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will cause sectarian tensions to rise again and the struggle to begin.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only an educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlandese that we are not French” – that was the ironic motto about themselves of the smallest federal state for its fifty-year anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre education system that in a study by the German Institute of Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
Thus, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighboring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career here with two or three degrees.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than average in higher schools.
“In the Sarre, the system of vocational education is taken advantage of,” says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people undertake their bachelor’s degree in the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very broad.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical professional training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Sarre Ministry of Education forced higher schools to make more publicity for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms in general education schools,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, this project has no cost.
Comparison with upcoming studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students with delay in school development dropped from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the disgust of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could good results.
Despite the fact that the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez is changing time.
Venezuela will soon have a different time zone than the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez changed the time in the South American country, delaying the clock for half an hour.
Chávez is now a comedian in Spain.
As by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass to at least four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed on its day the obligation to the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to the hostage-taking action.
The leftist nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity doesn’t allow me to do so,” says Chavez, who is propelling a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country should decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, their power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw Chávez’s mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez criticized Uribe's decision as offending Venezuela.
There is a lot of talk about Chávez.
A new tone of calling causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you keep quiet?", is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who felt upset by the continuous interruptions by the leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong climate.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase of value added tax and the tightening of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research told Bild.
The new unemployment insurance charges can also be paid to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% by moving from one year to another, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the labor office doesn’t have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level in 13 years.
When compared to last year, prices are rising by 3%.
Venus is the twin brother of Earth.
Despite the fact that its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been proposed until now.The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and turmoil at the poles, the same that appear also in winter on Earth.
Three decades ago, researchers had the suspicion that rays could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. on Venus the rays quiet from an altitude of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to Urey-Miller's famous model of the origin of life, rays caused life on Earth: storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, in turn, gave rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it is not so: if there were life there, that would have to be in one of the earliest states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface temperatures reign of 500 ° C, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
“Possibly, Venus is a ‘diabolical’ twin of Earth, but it’s still a twin,” Russell said.
The main goal of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for the research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles in "Nature", according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more characteristics in common with Earth than we had thought,” ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds on the North Pole, the researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by clouds that revolves faster.
This phenomenon resembles wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet, also called the Dawn Star or Vespertine Star, orbits the Sun for 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars, is not very similar to Earth, scientists rely on the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had clustered that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case, we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the Dalai Lama’s reception by Angela Merkel (Democratic Christian Union Party) in September.
"While I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute importance to me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor has not taken the distance from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust for the reception of the Dalai Lama and because of it was attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperant foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellor caused major misunderstandings in China-Germany relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to news sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to welcome the Tibetan religious leader in its official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama demonstrated that he was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that riots like those in France will occur.
Fights with police on the streets, shootings, car burns: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur, as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that everything be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
Barricades were made, the Vandals fired rifles at the police: after severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of Internal Affairs Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Democratic Christian Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We must also make sure that our country’s social problems do not take the form of violence.”
“We have to take it seriously,” he said in the newspaper Neue Presse, published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference, all this is already yielding its first fruits.”
It is still too early to say the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youths starred in severe riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 is above average.
There should be more professional training jobs.
Kolat emphasizes: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in the families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: “But in spite of everything, we have to be careful.”
We need to give young people the opportunity to get a job or vocational training faster.”
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew over the territory.
Authorities three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of 1,000 police officers has been taking care of the security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Interior Minister, announced that police would take rigorous measures until necessary.
On Monday night, about 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riots began with a traffic accident on Sunday, in which two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor’s office, the young man’s death was not the fault of the police.
The Kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, demonstrates that the coalition in terms of content has reached its final point and that there is nothing else to expect from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the lower house, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
As for the reproach made to him for having repeatedly devoted himself to foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptive phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and so he showed that he did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the lower house it was declared very clearly to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There was no sense of interest or feelings for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high-level policy that flees foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: climate change prevention: she praised herself very much for the decisions made at Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these climate targets should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the leader of the Democratic Christian Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
They are engaged in expressions so that an impulse comes to people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are little-value appearances.
Child poverty and worries about low-wage workers?
The only thing he is dedicated to is to talk about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It’s amazing how many times you’re mistaken when it comes to supplementing for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to stumble “as if it had been in an unknown territory,” when it was more specific information.
The Attack Section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, fought in a heated debate of Republican presidential precandidates on YouTube and now should fear only one candidate from the outside.
Tensions between the candidates were evident from the outset.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he had turned New York into “a haven for illegal immigrants.”
He, for his part, replied with serious reproaches: "I would say that his own home was a "port" for the illegal." Giuliani replies to the former Massachusetts governor saying that he was who employed the illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans has no clear favourite, the eight presidential precandidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, played by internet users who were uploaded to YouTube, do not have much content either.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," was John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from veterans of the Vietnam War, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulating his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that meanwhile the campaign’s most important topics are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied tax hikes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favourites are.
"At that time I made a mistake," Romney said, apologizing to the people and the television audience for advocating abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf has ruled without uniform.
A day after his resignation as chief of the army, the Pakistani president took the oath as president.
This is the end of the eight-year military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf has sworn in for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as chief of the army to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he came to power with an unbroken military coup, the former general governs the state for the first time as a civil head.
With his resignation as chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state’s Attorney General, after the oath Musharraf will soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the West.
Since the state of emergency was proclaimed in the Supreme Court, there have been many lawyers supportive of Musharraf.Last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the Northern Watyristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a remaster, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written at the band's best time.
At that time, they were very popular in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has its box, its cables and above all its buttons in front of it.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It doesn’t seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the Harmonia band was back to make music.
What has to be rebellious here is the following: the questions with precision have shown that the band’s name rebounded in people’s minds, but it wasn’t so special that after 32 years the audience wondered so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to the members of the Cologne Can 2003 band for their lifetime work, the surprising faces of German pop artists could be seen in the hall.
And when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and in those times I did not a great effect on the public, however, it was obtained later thanks to the others.
Some time ago, Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the Berliner Schaubuehne basement.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu! band, he managed to improve the fame of this German band that at those times was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in the Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist’s life full of surprises.
According to them, one day Ottenstein’s Harmonia singing association banner appeared on the rubbish, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Living as an artist is not just about knowing yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording participated almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do from time to time trials.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up entangled in esoteric themes and secured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since had more success than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album at Griessmer, that’s something to thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set the goal of cultivating this German own contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, the Neu! band was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was funded by public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all Krautrock’s influences on the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: “This music is the only sure music, to it belongs the future.”
There are photos where Harmony appears with producers in a estate.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatus they had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is what it should be.
Three people who go deeper into the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere it is coughed, whispered and in a good moment of emphasis it is sung "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a term of English origin.
It was never rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever cries “68!” here is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
On the stage, it reflects very well on what is already obvious.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
That can break one’s nerves or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere is more cynical.
The two films “The Hunting Party” and “Moerderischer Frieden” are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
Both were not very convinced.
Either the concepts are fixed too much on action and shooting, or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can not help in this case either.
At the beginning there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally we had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because nobody wanted to see him after his pleasant and insignificant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument for watching the movie “The Hunting Party – When a Hunter Becomes What He Pursues” (Why Today Film Titles Have to Be So Long and Foolish?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: at the bottom, his role as a war reporter is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him.
“The Hunting Party,” despite this triumph, along with “Moerderischer Frieden” which is the German production and will also be released this week, prove to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a situation of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there really never was a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about U.S. wartime reporters going to detect a Serbian war criminal called “Zorro,” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time results in a journey of madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning we are introduced to Simon Hunt, to whom he does not allow to be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script also predicts a love adventure with a Bosnian Muslim who will kill later.
Then “The Hunting Party” is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed accomplish what they could not accomplish for five years NATO, the CIA and all the heads-hunting world, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to avenge in a just way.
It is so bad, that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on the crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and Mladić are still free, and highlights that Americans and French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the big wrinkles on his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like “The Hunting Party” there are also these demons but they demonstrate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not just the genre of war films in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascoes.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always one rule applies: when a star goes through a crisis region or through the mines, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arguette, “On the Other Side of All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Bloody Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good film about the Holocaust, such as The Schindler's List.
Classics such as the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that’s why every mass murder (Massenmord) is presented directly on two TVs at home.
And that’s because screenwriters don’t have the slightest restraint (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
You don’t have to be a good person to make a movie.
Maybe you have to be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel “Lemprière Dictionary” and the war in the Balkans, he replied: “That’s only because some things never change.”
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered, and in Yugoslavia there will always be war.
Von Beust received negative criticism of the Olympics as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and economics for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust reminds that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday the resignation was “not good for the economic location.”
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the political and sports momentum could not beined at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "referring to another time".
On Wednesday, mayor Ole von Beustined his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in hosting the Summer Olympics would not take place until at least the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides," von Beust says in the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich’s application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance.”
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
"It's too early to let go of the opportunity, if at this time the plans are ruined," said HSB director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A resignation from the application is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the General Meeting of the German Public Higher School Sports Federation (ADH).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for 2015 Universities not as "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher School Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of such precious time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, MPs from the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated Olympia planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics provoked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They are not wooden boxes.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs over Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo-Box "type" on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brill-Boxes, the Stockholm Modern Museet museum conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brill-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Modern Museet museum, are fake, and a hundred of the other "Stockholm-type" ones, which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes in red, blue and white, with the same sample that had soap powder cartons "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Museum Moderna Museet hundreds of Brilliance-carton boxes were exhibited.These were not made by Warhol (due to the costs), but were brought directly from the "Brilliance" carton factory.
It was not about works of art, but about examples (which were only a few objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a Bright-box of wood, but they were not exhibited in the Museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as original of the "Brill-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions, some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him were produced and exposed.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives at the Modern Museet Museum, investigated six museum-owned bright-boxes and also three Swedish-owned private boxes that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990s copies shows that painting was applied with a roll without directly printing the tight plates.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Bright-Box list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museet museum and adds that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York does not come to any conclusion, the Modern Museet will classify these six boxes as the copies/exhibition objects.”
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these “serious accusations” that they are soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebels surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had struck a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers have been stuck in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, were tried on Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended up in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military policemen who had to watch him had passed into his ranks and followed his riot.
They entered the "Península" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are tired,” Trillanes said.
“We invite people to go to our ranks.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously headed the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
Major government critics called for a massive demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months, his government has been criticized for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company that the average price for one share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.5% of the capital.
There were many speculations about the company’s absorption.
There are also options for increasing the financial part in Versatel.
United Internet that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (Digital Subscriber Line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about the entry into the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution holds the securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day made participation with almost 10 percent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital expansion measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on commercialisation cooperations for DSL-products.
“Let’s strengthen our collaboration,” said a spokesman for United Internet.
The two companies founded a joint venture, MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, make 18.49 percent participate in Freenet.
That meant that both companies retained all options, especially participation in Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now, United Internet and Drillisch owned a direct 6,01 percent stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
