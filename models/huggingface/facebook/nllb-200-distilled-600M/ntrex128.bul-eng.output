Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they look like muppets.
Part of the members of the Assembly are dismayed by the proposal to change their name to CHUP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could become a laughing stock.
One Labour member said his group was concerned that the new name was being "Tup and Wullb".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one Plaid member, the whole group is unhappy and has offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party has indicated that his group is not biased towards the name change, but notes that the new name CUP (in English  MWP) has a certain verbal resemblance to mumpet.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drawing up the draft law to change the name, has made the following statement: It is clear that the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are referred to will be taken by the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which found wide support for the Assembly to be called the 'Parliament of Wales'.
As regards the position of its members, the Commission prefers members of the Welsh Parliament, for short, the CPSU, but the CPSU variant has received the most support after public consultation.
Members of the Assembly have offered alternatives, but reaching a consensus will obviously be a headache for Chairwoman Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit her amendment bill in a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly shall have the final vote on their names when they come to discuss the bill.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has an administrative region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name of the country, has said he will not read the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the country is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing against the backdrop of the churches' hardship in Harlem.
"If we look at it from a historical perspective, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams shares.
Today they're both gone.
Adams says the bar's disappearance is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways", he adds.
The bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where everyone meets regularly.
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of the assets will not come as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later will be in the same position.
The man adds that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks where people live who don't help the survival of the rest of the neighborhood's shrines.
The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not very likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.
Both churches were built by white herdsmen before Harlem became a black neighborhood of the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist flock moved in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, which is the main shopping street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan for its restoration, where they ordered the bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the Poor Bells.
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical tool.
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world that was used by a black musician  Dioniscio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the Riverside church  18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether mentions that he was never replaced by St. Martin.
What's been going on in St. Martin's over the past few weeks has been a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
From the vestiaria, which is the governing body of the pastoral body, consisting of secular leaders, they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese was inclined to transfer the costs to the vestiaria, even though it had no role in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy was injured by a shark on lobster hunting in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamle told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went in with a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought the child had caught a lizard and was excited, then realized how he was screaming, "Shut me up!"
He bit me!
Hamel says that when he reached the boy, he realized that the entire area of his wrist had been torn.
"I called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" adds Hamel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It's still unclear what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a threatened species.
Gillis adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of her body.
The authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Sumi in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Gillis notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them pose no threat to humans.
Sainsbury is planning an offensive on the British cosmetics market.
Sainsbury is facing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening up jewelry stalls at its premises where customers will be serviced by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive on the UK cosmetics market, which is valued at Â£2.8 billion and continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods are declining, the largest ever stalls for cosmetics will be located in 11 stores across the country, and, if successful, similar stores will be opened in other locations.
The investment turnaround in the ornamental industry is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space on the roofs previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it'll double the number of cosmetics on the market to 3,000, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space, similar to the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique range of makeup so that most products can be used by vegans, something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance shop will test discount programs at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will open in Seeley Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online marketing and the shifting focus on buying smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, has shared that the facilities will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to battle off discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury has Argos facilities in hundreds of stores and has also opened Habitats facilities since buying both chains two years ago  which the company claims has increased sales of foodstuffs and made the gains even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to redecorate its facilities for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals has failed.
Sainsbury had a joint venture with Boots in the early part of the new century, but the partnership ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's grocery stores.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281-unit pharmaceutical business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for Â£125 million three years ago.
It is therefore claimed that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, made the following statement: "We have transformed the look and feel of our jewelry stalls to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training for our colleagues who would offer professional advice on the ground.
Our range of brands is designed to satisfy every taste and every need in a captivating location, making us an attractive destination for cosmetics that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby's rejection of an Â£11 million deal.
Dragons star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a Â£11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoby doesn't have time for the Truly brand of household appliances and accessories.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Poltrou's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Peter Jones to giggle after pulling out of their profitable lifestyle product brand business at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts worth up to Â£1.5 million meant there would be no more time for his brand of household goods and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Poltrou, and rumors suggest it has doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated at Â£11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head to one of her vacation properties.
One of the sources shared the following: Truly was definitely Holly's top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment that would secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the bar totally unprepared.
No one thought it could happen on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse at the Marlow headquarters that's full of products waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the host of 'Today's Morning', one of the UK's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and could also lead to a delay in the launch of the brand.
Last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for the past ten years.
Willoughby herself co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, with Jones, 52, joining as the company's chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S' brand ambassador and will also replace Anne McParlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings".
Heavy negotiations leading to the breakdown of relations
He jokes about the criticism he would receive from news channels for making a comment that some would consider unfit for the president and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump back down so much?
Trump responded in his funny, news-like way.
I haven't given up on anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as a major step towards eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons.
But negotiations to remove this weapon are stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea saw no reciprocal attitude from the US towards its first steps on the path to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful", he noted.
We were headed for war with this country.
Millions of people would die.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship.
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results  halting missile tests, releasing hostages and returning the bodies of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiating with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate an island and kill hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be initiated.
Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unambiguous view that international assistance is not needed, which makes things a bit challenging, Ms Sumbong said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to go to Palo, it is still unclear whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The National Disaster Agency spokesman, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were currently assessing the situation in Palau to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country still remains unprepared for these kinds of natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Achech, they are not common sightings on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palo may have contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transportation between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to service earthquake victims has recently made its way to Palo, but it will be at least three days before it can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's backward infrastructure the focus of his election campaign by investing a large amount of money in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds is constantly haunting his office, as Joko goes back to the press next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure stemming from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with cats, bow and arrow, and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Stridge brought in a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Jerdon Shakire about 27-28 yards from Chelsea's door, as his team was down 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot, then fired a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed for the upper right corner of the net.
She's moved the drowning Cape Arisabalaga and is stranded in the net.
"I tried to take a good position to get the ball because players like Chuck are always looking for a pass in the front position, so I just tried to buy as much time as possible for a good shot at the door", Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the attacking Kante, I pushed my ball and I just shot without much thought.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the 25th minute after a goal by Belgian star Eden Azar.
The attacker of the Csines gave a five to Matteo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to halfway to Liverpool.
Kovacic switched double-supply in the center.
He then fired a quick pass, which led Azar to a clean position in the penalty area.
Azar ran over the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be the Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, Supopo agency spokesman Purvo Nughroho told a news conference.
The city of PalÃº, with a population of over 380,000, is plagued by the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was discovered this morning in Burkhead, Merseyside.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds at John Street's Grayson Mouse, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for assistance from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I urge anyone who has been near John Street in Burkhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have taken something with their board cameras, to contact us as they may have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Burkhead and that she was found on private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who think the woman is their friend arrived at the scene and asked where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Moose tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
One of the police officers told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, crying.
She keeps saying it's so awful.
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the cordon while another van was left outside.
There are police stationed in the cordon, watching the apartment block.
All persons with information are requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell becomes the newest memorial to be built through the rewrite of history.
Its ban would be poetic justice for his almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's proposal as nonsense and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said the following: "It was inevitable in this current debate to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the Palace of Westminster to become a target.
The iconic battle of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent performance of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more so in the 19th century than he is today, to be the defender of parliament against external pressure, which, of course, in his case is the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable figure who represents one side of the division that has occurred.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of commendation and praise.
Pig-killer wounds deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood near a haystack at the market in Liopanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig herd was preparing to inject vaccines into its pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xinhin, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, also slamming the door to the next door door open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the barn with a bloody statue.
Forensic expertise has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer deadly, the report reports.
"My cousin's arms were bloodied and disfigured", cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News, said.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else while the police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It's also reported that Yuan's family and the marketplace management are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was critically injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a snack.
They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect, concludes the man.
The weakened Rose will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
Weather forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause floodwaters in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 mph, which is a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At this time, over the Pacific Ocean, the syncline begins to form, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching sinkline will create frequent heavy rainfall in the southwest.
At local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, debris flows and probable desert landslides.
The deep tropical moisture will bring 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour in certain areas, particularly parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash flooding in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful of miles in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will cause dust to rise and strong winds to blow.
The approaching syncline will cause heavy rains in parts of the southern California coast.
It's possible to get over half an inch of rain, which will lead to small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before rainfall reaches a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October could bring major temperature fluctuations to the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics stay warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm early October, with temperatures of about 80 degrees Celsius expected from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the audition for Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the captivating witnessing of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaisey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political confrontation continued, with the networks suspending their regular backlash programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that requires the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had been drinking her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely adamant that nothing like this has ever happened.
It's probably even more than Nielsen reported, with 20.4 million viewers watching the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate data available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also traditionally has trouble measuring the number of people watching from their workplaces.
By comparison, we're talking about an audience that's about the size of a football championship game or a Hollywood awards show.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the first of all networks to average 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's audition, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in the Friday drama.
After a moderate Republican came out of his office with a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded him on Friday screaming at protesters as he tried to grab an elevator for a Judiciary Committee meeting.
During the whole bullying for a few minutes, he never looked up from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's representing the truth to the state?
You have power while many women are completely helpless, the attacks continued.
Flake replied that they had already left his office with a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he announced that he would speak further during the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks provided live coverage a few hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake has said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which the Democrats in the opposition are insisting on.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
After talking to Counsel and a few senators, Flake made a decision.
His election was definitely of vital importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has directed the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for political play with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her previously published on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady's Game Plan for Brexit", suggesting that collecting UK tariffs on the EU and vice versa is "absolutely absurd".
The shooting of Wade Sims: Police arrested suspect Dixon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police are arresting a suspect in the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
DiTion Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, with police reporting that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police have recovered the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS WAFB's office reports.
After Simpson was questioned, police announced that he confessed to the fatal shooting of Wade.
His bail is set at $350,000, Advocate notifies.
The East Baton Rouge Medical Corps released a preliminary report Friday, citing a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The administration is grateful to the Louisiana State Police's fugitive search division, the Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police Department and the local residents for the assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for the timely justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was in shock and disillusioned after Wade's death.
Wade said it's something that's been bothering people all along.
A volcano spreads ash over Mexico City
The ash ejected from the Popocatepetal volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded in the past 24 hours.
The center has observed multiple tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Hoquimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined the opposition demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to secede Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists who were not allowed by the gendarmerie began to froze the peacekeepers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later that day, other clashes with police broke out, with police using their clubs to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while those who declared for the preservation of the country's integrity returned with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, 14 people received medical treatment for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the region seeking independence even a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority voted for independence, although the turnout was low as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the region's polling stations in a series of violent clashes.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to block a demonstration in support of the National Police.
However, the demonstration took place, but she was forced to go a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer holds hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a state of stagnation, the man added.
Despite the notable, even small, victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence Catalan political parties are facing difficulties this year as many of their most prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or are being arrested pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puyug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that it's getting more and more tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders arrested pending a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
He claims that my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and repressions we are witnessing by the Spanish government.
Londoners: Arrested men after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings has announced that there was damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was shot with a shotgun.
Menga's goal brings a 1-0 win to Livingston over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory.
The newcomer to the Livingston Premier League surprised Rangers and brought only the second loss to Steven Gerrard in his first 18 games as manager of the 'Aibrox' club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team tied for second in the Hibernia standings.
Gerard's team is without a win on foreign soil in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday they face leader Hartz, who is eight points behind in the standings.
But before that, the Rangers were hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is on a six-game losing streak, and manager Holt hasn't tasted the loss since Kenny Miller took over last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the unwarranted guests.
Holt's team had to lead the score long before he scored a goal, and his direct style of play made it extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his punch went away, then Alan Litgow shot past the beam, after Craig Halcutta returned the ball with his head to him.
The homeowners let the Rangers play ball, knowing they could seriously make it difficult for guests from static positions.
And that's how I got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining and taking out Meng, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
By this point, the Rangers had dominated the ball more, but they faced the home side's unstoppable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to interfere.
This style of play continued through the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
The Rangers goalkeeper saved Scott Pittman with a leg shot, and a blow to Little's head passed through the door after another static position for Livingston.
Livingston's penal colony was raining centuries, but they were easily cleaned up, and the referee twice disregarded the guests' claims of a hole-in-one first after a one-on-one match between Halket and reserve Glen Middleton, and then when doubts were raised about a hand-play.
Fenomenal by Livingston  analysis
Allard Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team is just playing superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and lineup have hardly changed since the team returned to the Premier League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halket was incredible, organizing the defense in a superior way while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell under constant pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's guidance, they've demonstrated some great things, but in this case, they were far below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, only once they managed to break the home defense  this loss should wake up the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
Friendship is cooling down because of issues affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but nevertheless, many supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's own policies and the decision by the German government to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the devastation caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Rider rests after a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but nevertheless the cyclist died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died after being hit by a hit-and-run driver on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police have announced that their staff is working to identify the man, and will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were wounded in riot
Six prison guards were wounded in a riot at a high-security male prison, the Bureau of Prisons reports.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at around 09:30 am British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Special agents from the Tordano unit have been called to deal with eight prisoners, as the riot itself is confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor facial injuries and received on-site medical attention.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained staff have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards have received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we make it very clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police, with the possibility of further sentences.
Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after a prisoner was attacked, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to handle a violent riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although drought-prone areas may benefit)
Arizona is rarely hit by a tropical storm, but it is highly likely that this will happen early next week as the weakened, weakened, Rose hurricane travels through the desert of the southwest, carrying with it the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already established flash flood advisory posts on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain on late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rainfall possible in some places.
For those who are not at risk of flash flooding, the rain caused by the Rose may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some rainfall is likely to be helpful, as the southwest is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Seasons Monitoring Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, the second-worst category, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which on Sunday morning still boasts a maximum sustained wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach land near Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall over part of Mexico can be severe and can lead to significant flooding.
Summary rainfall is expected to be up to 6 inches from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches, weather.com reports.
It will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The primary risk of or consequences of the Rose is extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", warns the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to result in life-threatening flash floods and waste-carrying streams in deserts as well as wetlands in mountain terrain.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He's been admitted to a hospital where his condition remains stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have captured what happened to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been plagued by the viciousness and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the Democratic Party's insidious and outrageous tactics", Trump announced at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has declared that Kavanaugh has suffered from the mischief and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blaisey Ford's accusation of sexual assault decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the indictment hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favor of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a great reputation for public service", the president told a gathering of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly viewed Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
Even though I'm not a candidate, I'm actually involved, too, Trump continued.
That's why I'm running around and fighting for good candidates.
Trump noted that the Democrats have set themselves a mission to prevent and hinder.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, as reported to CNN by a senior Republican Party aide.
Hundreds are killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the death toll rising
At least 384 people have died after many were swept away by the coastline's gentle giant waves when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palou on Friday when at sunset the coast was washed by waves up to six meters (18 feet) high, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami peaked after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, causing many to become victims of the disaster", said Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The water had dragged cars, trees, entire houses, hit everything in its path", Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
"Some people climbed trees and thus managed to escape the water", he added.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palo Alto.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, demolished and worn bridges, and a water-surrounded mosque.
Secondary earthquakes continued to roar the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Application and Assessment Agency (BPPT) has released a statement that the energy released by the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb dropped during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nuggroho described the damage as "enormous" and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the ruined buildings, the spokesman added, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nuggroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palou, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
He also added that communications were completely cut off and there was no information from Donggala.
The Red Cross, meanwhile, said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers had already made their way to the affected areas.
It's a tragedy, but it can get even worse.
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for not reporting the devastating Palo Tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media show a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a huge water wall collapses on the shore and carries away both cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the video in time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage, which cut off communications around Palo and thus made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees are still desperate for food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is visiting the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala managed to reach Palou safely, where they found refuge in the braided sheds hanging in their office yard, they passed through a series of scenes of devastation, says Mr. Dosemba.
They told me they'd seen countless houses destroyed.
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the rescue and recovery efforts of emergency teams, some complain that experienced foreign rescuers are prevented from reaching Palou.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, sending personnel and supplies from abroad can only be initiated if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The threat is still at a regional level", said Auliya Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government declared it a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared it.
As the second night after the earthquake and tsunami falls on Palo, the friends and families of those still missing continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived the natural disaster.
A little boy was pulled from the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championships, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the field of paraplanetism, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa reached the paraplanerism community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palo who were participating in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue markings, however, the only response to his messages was the only gray one.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered", he added.
Thieves charge $26,750 while loading an ATM in Newport, Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who loaded a ATM in Newport on Levi's, a press release from the Newport Police Department said.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement park and was preparing to load it with cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man ran behind Brink's back and stole the purse of money.
Witnesses have spotted multiple suspects fleeing the scene, the report continues, but police have not indicated the number of those involved in the theft.
Anyone with any information on the identity of the suspects should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changing his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Along with announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who has dropped out for emotional reasons, the show's creator tells us.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious meaning to him.
I believe e is the most commonly used word in the Bible where it means ti or you, West shared earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
That way I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's gone from Kanye, which means just one person, to Ye, which is a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
The rapper is one of many celebrities in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and nicknames, including Puff Daddy, Pi DiDdy or DiDdy, but this year he announced his preference for the aliases Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's former associates, Jay Z, also appeared in a variant with or without a column and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico vows not to use the military against civilians.
Newly elected Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody student repressions.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President LÃ³pez Obrador promised never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people as left-wing student movements spread slowly through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The President also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for AI development.
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the AI front, the United States should double its research budget in this area, says AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loy, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various branches of the US government made statements on the topic of AI, although the US generally has no official strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be the No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
Doubling the AI development budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and are yet to make further breakthroughs in AI, Lee said.
Doubling funding could also double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough coming from the US, as Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie, Melon Lee worked on an AI system that beat America's most successful game-changer, then served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee credits the federal government with previous technology competitions, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics competition, and asks when the next one will be, which will help identify the new visionaries.
"Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding", Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations", the man claims.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes to immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its AI program.
"I think AI doctors should be automatically offered green cards", the man says.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation AI in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in AI development.
Meanwhile, the US legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission on AI, has not seen any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday whether the name of the country should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where a region called Macedonia exists, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents claims against its territorial integrity and therefore vetoes its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Georgy Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum himself, while at the same time a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the referendum will succeed in reaching the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The question in the bulletins is: Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the post-grossing Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my voice to the future of the country, to young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olga Georgijeva, 79, a Skopje citizen.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they will take the result of it into account to such an extent that the vote already has decisive weight.
To change the name of the state, two thirds of the parliamentarians must vote.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gyosse Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov in 54 prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of tents, which were blown up by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads proudly raised, not through the servant door", Kavadarkov said.
Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the investment needed by Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is above 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will be with us, as over 80% of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The State also stated that the positive outcome would lead to a more secure future for our people.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a survey that showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum  which is under active pressure.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the entire defence of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defence and brought Manchester City a 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outran three defenders from Brighton before he sprinted the ball into the empty space forward.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He slipped past one of the defendants, then left the rest of the gang at the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he turned left towards Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball back to Aguero with a touch, who with a right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
Aguero is struggling with some injuries to his legs, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We planned to play him for about 55 to 60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal right then and there.
But it was Sterling who secured the first advance of the Skylines in this match of the English Premier League.
He was discharged in the 29th minute.
In the naked Aguero situation, he got a pass deep in Brighton's half.
He immediately fired a left-flank pass to Liroy SanÃ©.
Sanne's forward with the ball, then he finds Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The Skyline attacker was able to spot him up close, just before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies.
Since the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, it doesn't make much sense for another game of a title-winning starting pitcher.
And yet, always ambitious, Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies if the game is meaningful to the Rockies, who lead by one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies have guaranteed at least a wild card berth in the game after a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but it's still not certain they'll win their first division title.
"Although we're not fighting for anything ourselves, we want to end the season with a good game in Denver where the audience and the other team will give their best to win perhaps the most important game of the year for them.
Why would I want to miss a game like this?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but they're supposed to let Scherzer in if the game is decisive.
For Scherzer, this would be his 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he's practicing on Thursday and he'll have his normal time off until Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is getting supporters in West Virginia.
President Caso hinted at the situation with his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
By November, everything we've achieved will be at risk.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the greatest moments in history. I also say that even though I'm not a candidate, I'm actually involved, which is why I'm fighting hard for the right candidates.
And then you see this horrible, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you are witnesses of their ruthlessness, of their malice.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to beat to get hold of power and government, because they're only interested in power and government, and we're not going to give them that.
The Democrats, according to the president, set a goal of preventing and obstructing.
"What we've all seen in the last four days", he continued, "is that the Democrats are angry, ugly, mean and unfaithful".
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud outcry from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting. It was really bad gesture.
Labour is not a big deal anymore.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I'm just the last Labour MP to be told he's not welcome just because I'm being candid.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship is criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with during the time of his predecessors.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and beneficial.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of a more moderate and shifted policy have long been forgotten, if ever on the agenda.
It was becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party leadership liked it.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I used to work for who I thought shared similar political views began to expect me to take a turn and take positions I would never agree with  be it on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I make public statements  no matter what I actually say  there's a whole outrageous barrage on social media where they call for a retaliation, a rejection of moderate politics, statements that I don't belong to Labour.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I even got more luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me are at least mostly political.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of these colleagues who face sexist or racist subversion every day without fear of it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widely known, and with every sign of mistrust or change in election rules it becomes increasingly narrow-minded.
Over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice to keep my head down, not to talk so much, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thatcher's government, which through its neglect led to the literal collapse of my excellent school, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state moves towards Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political dismissal will prevent me from acting in the way I consider best to protect your interests.
Chrisley Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
The undefeated Air led the standings.
The two late-stage assists may have slightly altered the final score, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to win this incredibly interesting Tennent League match.
The team is already leading the standings and only one of the ten teams has a losing record so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved crucial in a game that coach Peter Murphy and his team can be very pleased with.
I'm happy because our other teams have tested quite seriously in the last few games, and we're still undefeated, Murphy noted.
Robin Christy from Melrose said, "Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their position better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute ace, followed by a successful extra-time stroke by Frazier Climax, led Air ahead in the score, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to overturn the score after Jason Bagot executed an extra-time stroke.
Climone increased the penalty kick lead for Air just before halftime, scoring an essay after a solo act, and then making the extra kick, making the score 17-5 for Air at break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra-stroke by Bagot, cut the lead by just five points.
The game was suspended for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was moved to the carrier, and after the match was resumed, Air increased their advance after Stafford McDowall's essay and a successful extra strike by Climax.
The acting Air Force captain Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by putting strong pressure and executing an essay by Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed extra strike.
However, the hosts regained their spirit, and when Straun Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking ClimÃ³ off the ball, from the subsequent penalty shoot-out, McPherson executed an essay using the forward offensive line of Air.
Klymo made the extra shot, and soon did it again after Kyle Rowe caught a kicked ball from David Armstrong and took wing Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth home run.
The Still Game star seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Keernan seems to have turned to a more direct and warm industry after it was revealed that he was appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he also wrote and starred in alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final one for the show, and it looks like Keernan is already planning his life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Keernan had planned to join Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
The sea is ours: the sea that has no way out Bolivia hopes that the sea will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are constantly patrolling the Oxygenated Sealift Command at La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag above the public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: "The sea is ours on the right.
It's our duty to get it back.
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet handed to Chile after a bloody 19th-century conflict is still alive  and the call to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
In fact, that hope is now strongest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"The power is in Bolivia, there is a sense of vigor and unity everywhere, and the country is expecting a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadala.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will back Bolivia's demand and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is set to run for re-election next year, also put a lot of stakes on Monday's court decision.
"We're all close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean", Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of a court ruling in favor of Bolivia is quite small, and that even if it ruled in favor of Bolivia, that wouldn't change the reality.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to seize the territory of Chile and has decided not to determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's ruling is only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case is not complicated, replies Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt it.
The problem of access to the ocean was raised by the current government of Bolivia, says Zarate.
Then he hinted that Morales' warlike rhetoric had been erased and the little goodwill of Chile remained.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point resume negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to have a normal dialogue after what happened.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
He said Bolivia will have the incredible opportunity on Monday to open the door to a new era in its relations with Chile and the chance to end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides.
Calzadala also rejected the idea that Morales, who continues to be one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the problem of ocean access as a political bait.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to leave the Pacific Ocean, he added.
Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome our past problems
North Korea says it won't continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never commit to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech on Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the meeting of the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming fruitless diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean Kim Yong-un.
Ri called the idea that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is unwilling to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the path to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about abandoning an arsenal they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange for the preparation of a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion news in Paris reveals the latest scream of massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block out the sunlight, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which were smashing the fashion podium during Paris Fashion Week.
A lot of the unpractical hats caused a wave on Instagram over the summer, with designers sending their eye-catching creations to the fashion community.
Valentino's stunning proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide periphery that literally swallowed up the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry-decorated dune, a witch hat, and even pineapple, but they're not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also introduced a selection of weird masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were not as much a reminder of high fashion as they were of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs looked like a full-size scuba diving kit with snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a melted funnel of ice cream.
If you're attracted to this type of fashion trends, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the giant hats will soon be sold at the fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come just after the two-foot-wide straw hat that was seen on the heads of everyone from Rihanna to Emily Rataykovsky.
The cult of the highly impractical hat that took over social media led to another huge design for the fashion podium  straw beach bag, almost as big as the one wearing a swimsuit.
The orange-colored raffin bag, with raffin rind and a white leather handle, was Jacquemus's all-time favorite item in the La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer. After the designer made such a big impression, it's going to be hard to ignore the demand for wholesale accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with another excellent performance of test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Association (SCIS), aim to provide the best possible standard for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their place in a global world.
As an education sector that can create and implement personal curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, your words can reach them.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
And from the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are the top-performing languages for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved a high A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils have achieved A in Chinese, with the same score being achieved by 72% of those studying German, 69% of those teaching French and 63% of those studying Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages are given the same treatment as natural and mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical) in and beyond the programmes of independent schools.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Employment and Labour Skills Commission showed that 17% of the reasons why employers find it difficult to find employees indicated insufficient language skills.
Therefore, learning foreign languages is becoming increasingly compulsory in order to prepare young people for future careers.
More and more jobs require foreign language proficiency, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if a person mastered a foreign language, he would have a real advantage in the future, since he possessed such a skill that lasted a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person on the same page as the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4000 UK adult citizens in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language whose level of proficiency reaches a double digit rate of 15%.
That's why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
The ability to speak several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different in terms of the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are experts in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At present, there is no denying that in a global business environment languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which must be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should really be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, together with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Association.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the fans who are excited to see LeBron James' first game against the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be taking part in the team's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play in the match yet.
"He'll be on the field between one and 48 minutes", Walton announced on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau posted on Twitter that James will probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers' preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare for the new season", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies that include stops in familiar locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the confirmation vote for his election to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump aims to support the upcoming midterm election as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in November's ballot.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below via the live YouTube feed.
Trump is likely to review this week's Supreme Court nominee hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, which have been tense over allegations of immoral sexual conduct, holding the Senate confirmation vote for a week until an FBI investigation is underway.
The main purpose of this series of rallies, however, is to help the Republicans gain momentum in the November election.
So President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallies next week are meant to mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we're starting a campaign season full of commitments", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, declining to be named.
The rally tonight, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring attention to Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, where he won by more than 40% in 2016, will be held on Saturday.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in sociological research.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA will fight to the finish, keeping their hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three straight no-nonsense sessions, Sunday afternoon's games may have brought what Ryder Cup needs.
The change in the edge in sports is a rather subjective concept, but players believe in it unreservedly, even more so in competitions like this one.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led by six points, and now it's only four, so I guess we've gained some momentum", Jordan Spite said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with only 12 points left to allocate.
But as Spit says, the Americans have a lot to show for it, and their fans should not be disappointed judging by the sportsmanship of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four possible points.
Spit is showing great form from the beginning to the end of every hole and is the true leader of his team.
The fans' cheers grew stronger as he advanced to the round, in which with a precise strike he evened the score in the fourth game after Thomas and the team were two strokes behind after the first two holes.
His strike, which won the 15-hole game, was met with a strong reaction of enthusiasm, which led us to believe that not everything was really lost for the American team.
"It's important to stop thinking about anything else and focus on your own game", says Spit.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
A strange but fascinating couple from Europe, they've won four out of four and they seem to be doing everything right.
They were the only couple that didn't make a goddess on a Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't make a goddess on a Saturday morning, or a Friday afternoon or a morning.
These successive successes, as well as the seemingly energetic flow of energy between them and the enthusiastic fans, have cemented the belief that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari who will bring the potential victory of Europe as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the stories of European fame proved a bit premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning football games while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
The gods and the two devils of the first nine holes got the Spanish and Swedes into trouble they couldn't handle.
But in Sunday's games, there's no way anyone else can solve your problems.
Forball and Forwards matches are extremely interesting to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can change at any given moment.
The Europeans were playing better as a team and so they had a significant lead before the last day, but this session of four-game matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the end, something that many people, especially in the United States, were very doubtful about.
Europe leads by 106 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the United States by 106 after the four-man and four-man format matches on Saturday.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against the unbeaten Tiger Woods, which increased their assets in the Le Golf National to four points.
In an attempt to reclaim the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas BjÃ¶rn's European team dominated the morning foursquare against the Americans who made mistakes after mistakes, and in the end Europe won the series 3-1 victory.
The United States showed more resistance in the Fourth of July games, where they won two games, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European rookie to score four straight points, and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood", after this sensational weekend became only the second couple to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid unopposed in four bowl games, they were highly motivated to beat the broken Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambeau with an even more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally showed glimpses of his genius, but so far he has 19 losses from 29 games in the football and football games, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who was given a break for the morning Foursquare match, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the Foursquare match in a 2&1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coppa, respectively, number one and number three in the world.
However, the European team failed to enjoy a perfectly pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas have restored American hopes by scoring two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult 2-1 win over the Spaniards John Ram and Jan Polter in the Foursquare games, and later came back to beat Polter and Rory MacIlroy 4&3 in the Foursquare games, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team come back from a four-point deficit before singles, and according to the regulations, Furyk's team will retain the trophy even if they are tied.
However, since they have been up for two consecutive days, their chances of returning on Sunday seem to be low.
North Korea says there's no way to disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the World Organization's annual general meeting, Ri Yong-ho said that significant goodwill measures have been taken over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, destroying the nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not trust our own national security, and under no circumstances will we be able to unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri expressed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a "non-nuclear disarmament approach" in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking stepwise measures, his statement seemed meaningful because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the Korean Peninsula's nuclear disarmament, and Trump gave assurances about North Korea's security.
North Korea has been pushing for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for easing the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States is insisting that we first eliminate nuclear weapons and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposing the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don't know us.
The problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust".
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party to the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea, not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stagnation.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on the US mainland was inevitable after the angry President Trump called Kim Jong-il a suicide missile.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with total destruction, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea eliminates nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making gangster requests.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat a growing culture of all-night learning with caffeine.
A teacher found that students at the world's number one university often don't even think about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he talked about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And finally one girl came to me and said, "Why am I being told this so now, in my senior year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic achievement and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One part shows a room in a dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers, and books to be explained the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
Another part of the participants discussed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know just as you have the right to know the health effects of your choice to smoke, added Prof. Keisler.
The culture of pride in "learning all night long" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be the students' secret weapon in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says, even to avoid overload, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode that keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keisler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread it all over the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Keisler recommends that students consider setting bed and wake alarms and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: Goal by Menga knocked Gerard's team down
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's joke broke the unthinkable team of Steven Gerrard and brought a 1-0 win to Livingston.
The Aybrokes wanted to record their first win as a guest of victory in February with 4-1 over St Johnston, but Gary Holt's side scored only Gerard's second defeat in his 18 matches as manager, leaving his side eight points short of the departing Harts, the Ladbrokes' top league champions.
The manga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers' lack of constructive ideas at no point seemed close to a draw.
After the game, the Rangers have slipped to sixth place, and Livingston is already third, just behind the second Hibernia by a goal difference.
There may be additional problems for the Rangers, as sideman Calum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was obviously thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livingston one-shot lead that scored against Harts last week, and he should be pleased with the way his aggressive team matched all the opponents' actions.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rare cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to score in the second minute when Menga took out a touchdown on Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the halfback missed a good opportunity.
Later, Keegan Jacobs' center from Foul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow diverted the ball away from the rear of the beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't produce anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a 15th-minute punch when he faced Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only gave two accurate shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly managed to easily hit Lassan Kullibali's head and the weak shot of Ovi Edjalia.
Although Livi's 34th minute hit was surprising given the ball, it was well deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with deep centeredness on Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed it to Menga, who was easy to implement.
Gerard responded to the break by replacing Coolidge with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately resulted in a result when the wing was given to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the strike.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a home-court style of play, with Litgow and Halket continually pushing forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor managed to take a hit on Jacobs, and on the next corner, Litgow shot his head past the beam.
Rangers backup Glenn Middleton asked for a punch at the end of the game after a one-on-one with Jacobs, but Thompson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The inventor of the gauge counter
Page from our Sunday Morning diary: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROWN... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science ever since, the gauge counter became a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, was released.
Man: What, for God's sake, is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and it's used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
It sure does matter right now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to see other people's cells.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to see and kill foreign cells.
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and inject it back into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine that trains her immune system to recognize foreign cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear in over 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then inject them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kenny West delivered a speech in support of Trump wearing a hat that read "Let's Make America Great Again" on his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing a meaningless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for President in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the tagline "Let's Make America Great Again", he turned against the Democrats and voiced his support for Trump.
I often talk to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sexual Violence Appeals by Christine Blazey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had backstage issues with his hat.
I was tortured behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat".
They've been torturing me!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see the ship sinking?" "Tell me he's going to wear Superman's suit because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
The comments caused at least two public outcry and the SNL team members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of them telling: "The entire studio shut down".
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has puzzled many with the song "I Love It" dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: Blessed are you who have made the right choice".
However, the host of the talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just being himself, and that's great.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I think welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and is now officially known as Kenny West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and the music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the DA.
The star of "Ignorance and the Throne" Keith Harington is against toxic masculinity.
Keith Harington is best known for his role as the sword-swinging John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series The Office of the Unknown Soldier, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the stereotype of a matcho hero, saying that showing such roles on screen often leads young people to think they have to be "serious" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed something was wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels "very convinced" that this problem needs to be solved.
"At the moment I personally am firmly convinced what did we mistake for masculinity?" he said.
What do we teach young men about the problem we see now?
Keith believes television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many masculine characters.
He continued, "What is it that is born and what is it that is taught?
What is taught by television and the street that makes boys feel they need to become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, claiming that he had "terminated the battlefields and horses".
From November, Keith will be starring in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that's how he gave me my future family and set my life forward", he said.
Rose plays Egrit, the girl who Keith's character John Snow falls in love with, in the fantasy series, Emmy Award-winning.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and spina bifida.
According to the health services, more than 820,000 people in the country have been affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases are caused by sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in LGBT communities is widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies any leak of Republican Senate data, denouncing dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, U.S. House member Maxine Waters condemned allegations that a member of her team posted personal information to three Republican state senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and sites on the far right.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person at the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual conduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The member of my team  whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims  is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flicher.
"There is anger in this denial", wrote Flicher.
That suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be provocative.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism by Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"In fact, if it's true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office has filed a complaint with the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, and that they are held legally liable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team".
Johnny English's revue is exploding again. The weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson.
It's now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every new British-made film, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy spy franchise for Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will self-deprecation and the mimicry that tell us how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English with his eyes closed and his human face has the right to renew things a second time. His name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comic work for movie fans who don't speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering brilliance, owns a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a lot of the man who contributed a note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
It was also originally based on the chaotic traveler and international man Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
In the last Johnny English movie, there's a couple of good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and for a short while the feathers were jammed in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather weak and oddly excess, especially when serious movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible include a dose of comedy.
The humor seems to be more about children than adults, and I don't think Johnny English's crazy accidents are innovative and focused, because Actinson's lack of play reminds me of Mr. Bean.
The usual premise is that Britain is facing serious problems.
A cyber hacker hacked into the British super secret spy network and revealed the identities of all operational agents to the horror of the agent on duty.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a bloated and vengeful figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her she needs to call in some retired agent, since all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently a teacher at a glamour center, but who illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is called to White Hall for emergency instruction and reunits with his longtime assistant, Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, married to a submarine commander, a fun role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret service and face the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: dressed as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of the Volta; and English provokes a real anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to inspect the interior of the Volta house.
All the jokes are definitely from the previous movie, but since they're so cute and violent, there's a lot more content here for kids.
It's a very mediocre production.
Like in other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: Can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies they've developed a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that British people should work four hours a week but get paid five.
The party claims that it wants company bosses to give workers the savings made by revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them one more day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would save the party's economic agenda and plans to shake the country up for the benefit of the working class.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen immediately, but the four-day workweek is an endeavour that fits into the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers and the overall industrial strategy of the Party.
The Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, at the moment this aspiration is not being accepted by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's politics, it is not considered.
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to reveal his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the non-executive directors and consultants in utilities.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose a lien on the basis of the alleged infringements.
It also confirmed plans to bring workers to the boards of companies and to set up privatisation funds to transfer 10% of the net capital of private companies to employees who can earn annual dividends of up to Â£500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could cause some of the Republican Party senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes Correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after the matter, and after the matter was told, and said to him, Didst thou do this?
He was determined, firm, and unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change that, it takes a shocking accusation", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett categorically denied it, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive ensemble of performers and carries out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people to the great parade in Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also learn about the true purpose of the event -- eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or activities such as volunteering, sending a non-e-mail to a world leader, calling a phone or otherwise contacting to help raise awareness about their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is a global citizen 12 years before he reaches his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to take action or is it just another case of so-called "clichÃ©" people think they're doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters, which are pushing for many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Group has also reported that the Group's activities have been linked to a number of other activities, including the promotion of the development of the European Union's financial markets.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the UK's 'Food Power', a partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to help children reach their full potential, which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a historic record", said the Food Power Ambassador Tracy Ullman to a live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, 'The Power of Nutrition', which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the WFP's website asking why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global citizen replied: It's going to be a long and difficult road we're going to fail sometimes and we're going to fail again.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Mona are just some of the performers at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use naval forces to block and obstruct energy exports.
Washington could, if necessary, use its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria  specifically where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said.
The official said there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market", he said.
Zink addressed the attendees at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that presents itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is more or less fuel stimulation and replacement", he said, while identifying Russia as a "one-stop shop" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration has a task of boosting liquefied natural gas exports to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the unsuitable Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is making Berlin a hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion pipeline of North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at running for president in 2020, says the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take a serious look at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
It's time for women to come into Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top, she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I'll be taking my candidacy seriously.
Warren expressed his judgment of President Donald Trump during the city council meeting, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried deeply about my soul like Donald Trump is worried about our democracy", she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a sociological survey conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents themselves do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the likely Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic Party officials discussed regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out the PTSD of Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the September video.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after he's returned is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with", she told a crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called his arrest a "slow in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that they were returning slightly changed, stubborn, coming back and wondering if they would receive the respect that they and their brothers in arms have given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Vasaila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasaila Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a judicial challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a petition of goodwill in Washington, D.C. in support of asylum seekers and challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been released.
She claims that her partner and the sons of her gang's violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
State lawyers who assist Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed immigrants who are fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Russin said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of the facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle, the goodwill report says.
Furthermore, the lawyers argue in the report that policies that deny immigrants entry are detrimental to the US economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief, Sessions said in his policy communication of 11 July.
The refuge was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even not all the serious ones, that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo Alto as deaths double during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, reassuring her sick boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palo.
Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save some of their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Duffy Harris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, were placed outside Army Hospital in Palo Alto, where patients are being treated outdoors for ongoing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers feeling the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was stuck in the broken wall, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he came to town with his family to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "tornishing" propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump cited a paid publication of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US congressional elections highlighted what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to run commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they are equalizing import tariffs between states.
According to experts from the US and China, at the beginning of the trade war, tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a commentary in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, is now doubling the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's respected tradition of free speech and press by launching paid advertising in the Des Moines Register, writes Branstad.
In contrast, at the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you'll find limited speeches and you won't see a real reflection of the mixed opinions the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory given that the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party, he writes.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article, although it did not specify exactly who.
With the Kavanaugh massacre, Republicans are turning down female voters for midterm elections, analysts warn.
As many high-ranking Republicans stand by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over several sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, specifically from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around the ceiling are extremely strong and most Republicans have already indicated they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be turned back, Grant Raher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute appeal for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, nor November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be turned off", said news reporter Steve Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say the problem is already serious; it's true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that a retaliatory response could follow if Republicans insist on confirming her candidacy.
"It's become a big mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it's about how Republicans handle this and how they deal with it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided on who to trust following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more inclined toward the latter.
A new YouGov sociological survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
And 38 percent say they believe Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's plea, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of intoxication when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals while they were at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is starting a venture that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was global dominance.
"We have to do it now", he said of the venture.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own online personal data repository, or POD.
It contains lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are all available in any browser, and at the same time, it's all of them at the same time.
The unique feature of an online personal data repository is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "authorization of personal data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers who have signed a contract to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they're going to make a complete change when all their business models are completely updated overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide energy for commerce and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a major influence in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: in memory of the Victorian-era First World War priest
It marks 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in World War I combat.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was extremely symbolic that the monument would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's medal-winning work.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin in very thick fog and heavy fire from artillery and artillery.
He later attacked the line of fire and with incredible bravery led the regiment forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of his unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble.
He and his brother Dr. James Van wore a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was a great honor to be part of the parade and added that the true hero's virtue is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people.
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine you're sitting around all night watching the full Bellator 206 and you can't witness the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 matches, including six from the main card, and was to be broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6pm, just as Geoghard Mussey and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after waking up early, especially because of the fight.
Fan described the switch to the children's animated film as some kind of sick joke on Twitter.
The government has ruled that at 6pm this content is not appropriate, so the programme has been replaced by a children's programme, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, in response to a question about the broadcast.
Peppa the pig, yeah.
Bellator President Scott Cocker said they would work on planning the meetings to engage UK viewers in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetition, we can solve the problem", said Cocker.
But it's six in the morning on a Sunday and we can't plan things so that here the event is on a Sunday and there it's on a Monday.
We're working on it, though.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that. It was government.
I can promise you, next time, that won't happen.
We're going to stick to five games instead of six  as we usually do.
This is an unpleasant situation.
Tom Daly felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic water polo player Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality  but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn't realize that everyone was like me.
In an interview for the first issue of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he talks about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he started to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been hospitalized for a few months.
When he was on the first Laverne Daley show, he said he felt less than anyone else growing up because it was socially unacceptable to like both girls and boys.
He said, "Until now, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was a man, he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy to be able to live openly, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire hope for others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, surprised him.
Daly married Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, but he claims the age difference was never a problem.
When you go through so much when you're so young, he first participated in the Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "It's hard to find anyone your age who's had similar ups and downs".
They became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says his whole worldview has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I'm only interested in winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics.
"I couldn't tell him to be with me, Dad, or in the front row", he said.
I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that moment, when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he wasn't invulnerable, he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that my whole life I dreamed of jumping at the Olympics in front of an audience at home.
It also inspired his choice of the first song Proud by Heather Small which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him feel good.

The lost Michelson uniform remains on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he's gonna have to get back in shape if he doesn't want his record tied to a failure.
Mickelson, who has taken part in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was left on the bench by captain Jim Furick for the four-man and four-man matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a key figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time major champion spent his day as a fan and training his strikes from a distance in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old, who was never among the best right-handed players at the peak of his career, is not in optimal shape for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong hit.
And if the pitch itself isn't sufficiently disturbing, in Game 9 on Sunday, Mickelson will face off against the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleathwood and is aiming to win all four of his games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 singles, get off to a strong start, it could turn out that Mickelson's game is absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly have said anything much differently.
"He totally understood his role today, he put his back on me, he hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's confident in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and he's given as much as he has in the past and this week.
I probably never imagined him playing just two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just so happened, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will be breaking Nick Faldot record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could end his career at Ryder Cup, which never came close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and is a great guy for any team", he explained.
I think the younger players have been having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, is aware that the great advance may soon be melted down.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great lead he has gained before the last day of the Ryder Cup singles matches can easily be erased.
The Danish made his debut in the Valderrama in 1997, when the team captained by Seve Balisteros led by five points ahead of the Americans, but right on the final right was almost overtaken and barely managed to hold on to the victory by 141â2-131â2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline where we lost and at Valderrama we won, but very hard, Bjorn said after the 2018 European team won by 53 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading by 106 at Le Golf National:.
So history needs to show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
Nothing's done until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try and win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I keep saying that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we also know our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.
Pleased with the players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never rush into the festivities.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come out in the foreground, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're out alone, then you're putting your full potential as a golfer to the test.
That's the message that needs to be delivered to the players: tomorrow you have to give your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he too must give up to the end.
Unlike BjÃ¶rn, rival captain Jim Furyk would want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exception of only Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these big reverses on the last day. He was part of the Brooklyn triumph. And then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the Miracle of Medinah.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd better make the same good start you saw at Brooklyn and Medina.
When the advantage moves from one direction to the other, these mid-matches are played under enormous pressure.
So we formed our own team and distributed our boys as we wanted to try and do the impossible tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose these players in this order because I think that gives us the best chance of success", BjÃ¶rn said of his choice of singles.
Germany has again delayed the launch of a new warship.
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War warships, but this will not happen until at least the following year due to poor systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand's new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
Understandably, they will have a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods  The latest frigates must be able to use up to two years before returning to the harbours of homework.
The continuing delays mean, however, that the advanced warships  which are rumored to allow Germany to show strength overseas  will be old by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The accidental F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of significant software and hardware defects that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruisers will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors  only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the possibility for the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project  including crew training  also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering â¬3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion)  from the initial â¬2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the fleet was actually running out of ships capable of carrying out missions.
The official said the problem had grown bigger over time as the old ships were decommissioned but not provided with new ones.
He complained that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret lives of the bats.
A new study conducted at a mansion in the Scottish Highlands aims to determine how flies use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common sticks and brown arrowhead water lilies at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations in the mansion to track the activity of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the records will determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and the species that emit them.
A map of their habitat and a report will be drawn up to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dwyer, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to the flies and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The population of flies in Scotland and the UK as a whole has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
Population risks may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and certain chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, flies are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 historic gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only special fleas reserve in Scotland at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galway, which is home to eight out of Scotland's ten species of fleas.
The mansion manager, David Thompson, says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a great ground for flies", he noted.
We have old buildings, very old trees and a finished suitable habitat.
But there's a lot more about flies that we don't know, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
It stresses the importance of checking for flies before property maintenance activities are carried out, as the unintentional destruction of a shelter is likely to kill up to 400 female and young flies and to destroy an entire local population.
Flies are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish fly conservation official, encourages the community to help.
She said, "I still have a lot to learn about our flies and about many of our animal species, because we just don't know what happens to their populations".
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations and his lawyers will sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the allegations of rape against him as fake news, saying that people want to be famous using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American actress Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid her $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram video, addressing his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were posted, 33-year-old Ronaldo branded the post as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no, no, what are you doing?
What they said about me today was fake news, the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
They want to be known by using my name.
That's normal. I'm not going to lie.
They want to make a name for themselves on my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they call "unacceptable publication of suspicions about his personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek damages for moral damages in an amount that is consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident in question is alleged to have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the soccer player's room where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a good guy at 99 percent, but in this case he just gave up on the 99 percent.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt terrified of revenge and worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement because she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Prix for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret losing carmakers
Britain will regret forever losing its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", he said.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of the delay at the border in the case of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnaston  where the Auris and Avensis  are made last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, says they're closing their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in cases of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the 'time-of-the-fact' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border issues, which industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota would be unable to wait more than a day to complete their inventory at the factory in Darbyshire, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's strategic plan for future relations with the EU was precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize that opportunity", he told BBC Radio's 4's Today programme.
Following the claims not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but in the longer term they warn that the additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has been at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of Unite in the factory, said that its members are increasingly worried: "From experience I believe that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have laid out a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's fight continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has fueled rumors for months about Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he was resigning.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was testified to by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "It's not a date yet, it might be this week, but seeing all the other things happening at the Supreme Court, I think it might be postponed to next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference from the White House on September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked me why.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences were not due to a dislike for the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although she shared: "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior".
Then she hinted that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President has more questions and answers than any president before him, she said, adding, without citing evidence:We have checked these statistics.
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often, and you've seen us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and it's going to replace the press conferences once you get the chance to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times bizarre behavior in front of the press.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister for Health addressed EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service in writing to express the Government's gratitude and desire to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the costs of the procedures established for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: 'Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I value the contributions of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, to the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's meeting when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened just before midseason.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just passed out there", said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel fed Abercrombie with oxygen to the sidewalk before he was placed on a carrier and taken to the locker room for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had just come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details yet about the nature/seriity of the injury and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore on a college scholarship, is in his first season at Tennessee State since transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on the purchase of real estate in the UK
Under new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on UK property purchases, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the arms tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise over Â£120 million a year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty on real estate in the UK, with the additional proceeds going to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will support government efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The additional  which is in addition to the current excise duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for secondary dwellings and property purchased for the purpose of giving , may amount to up to 3%.
The Treasury expects revenue to rise by up to Â£120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for first-time homebuyers to enter the property market.
Many of the wealthy areas  especially in the capital  have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the crest tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping high property prices by plundering land but not using it, and he asked Mrs May to drop the quotas on affordable housing to fix the shame of Britain's housing.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including a rental control and an end to evictions without blame.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream of making the lives of every new generation better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not normal for non-British people and foreign companies to buy homes as easily as hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the discomfort of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said that his biggest ambition in his career is to be the senior coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot has taken up the challenge of reviving the North East England club, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points clear of the top flight.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after last season he brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a match for the B team and that was it, Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland's Hampden, which as a kid I watched with my dad, so I've always been attracted to the national team.
But this opportunity would only open if I had success at club level.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers include names such as Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former coach of Aloa Athletic said he was not worried about being the heir to such established names at such a famous club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success right now will be measured by a positive answer to the question Can I get this club back to the top flight?
Because by structure, base and conditions, he's definitely at the top of the league, he said.
It won't be easy to get back to the top of football, but I'll admit I've only made it here if I can get the team back there.
Ross has only been a manager for three years, after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alois avoid relegation to the Third Division and turned St Mirren from a relegated team into a championship winner the following season.
Ross shares that he feels more comfortable now than he did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
I was really at the crossroads, he remembers the time he took Aloa.
I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, even before I was an active player.
Sounds weird, because I was doing well, making good money, and having some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and strain at work, but I just feel like being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I really do, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals a study.
The summer heat has increased the incomes of British pubs struggling to survive, but it has created more strain on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting, which compiled the statistics, said: "Due to the long sunny weather and longer than England's expected World Cup attendance, in July a similar pattern followed as in June, when pubs saw a 2.8 percent increase, but restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and bars have been the best performers in their growth compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The food pubs were also hit by the sun, but not as badly as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages jumped 6.6 percent per month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of the RSM Leisure and Entertainment Analysts, shared: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home services sector.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year can be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the food service managers, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired rest.
Overall sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK pub, bar and restaurant sales analyst, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over Â£9 billion and is a proven industry benchmark.
One in five children hides a secret social media account from their parents
One in five children  some as young as 11  has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study revealed
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in fake Insta pages
News has raised fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a basic profile that showed their parents
One in five kids -- some one in 11 -- creates a social media profile that keeps a secret from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Insta accounts  link to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual material is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean primary profile that they showed their parents, but they also had secret profiles.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenage boy who encouraged others to rape him.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Elide Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Elid Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics Scotland as a non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most accomplished athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has described this move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Elyde enjoys great respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its appeal", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I really hope to be able to contribute and help promote sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost the ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I recovered and to what extent.
It was a tiring job, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
Advertising for a breastfeeding pump that compares mothers to cows divided opinions online
A breastfeeding pump company shared online opinions with an advertisement that compared breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of the world's first expected wearable silent breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie has launched a music video commercial to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives breastfeeding women to express themselves.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cow's den filled with hay against the background of a song with lyrics that include: "Yes, I'm drowning, but you don't see any tail".
The song goes on: "Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, breastfeed my friends".
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many claiming to belittle the dairy industry's horrors.
A very stupid decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth, someone wrote.

Another comment: It's understandable that it's traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them for breastfeeding pump advertising for mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added, "So much inadequate advertising".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song was "extremely funny".
I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The draining made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little bit of a rat, but I accept it for what it is.
This product is brilliant, someone wrote.
Another comment: This is a ridiculous ad aimed at mothers who are relaxing (often at their jobs or in the bathroom) and feel like they're crying.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discrete pumps placed in their bras.
The campaign concept is based on the idea that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, with no wires or tubes, and is quietly assembled in a breastfeeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside until they're full.
Anna Balarin, partner and Creative Director at Mother, comments: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the breastfeeding and the dairy cows, we wanted to focus attention on breastfeeding and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Martha Yakubovsky, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who fear risking staying in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other family adults would be required to provide fingerprints, which would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who wanted to be guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Nearly 80% of persons who are guardians or family members of guardians reside illegally in the country, with a large proportion of them being foreign criminals.
So we'll continue to pursue these people", Albanes said.
In an effort to speed up the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to officials at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference call rather than in person to present their legal status case to an immigration judge.
Those who are determined to be unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape, according to shelter officials and reports that have been leaked from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing at large facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving the children to the city of Pallatkov, without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, could aggravate the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria is demanding the immediate withdrawal of the occupation forces of the United States, France and Turkey.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mu'alem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that appropriate action would be taken against them.
They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally, he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the war on terror was nearing its end in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleared of both terrorist organizations and any illegal presence of foreigners.
The United States has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria who primarily train and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian forces, the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As regards the refugees, Muallem said the conditions were tolerable and could be returned, accusing some Western countries of spreading unfounded fears that urge refugees to stay out.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help with these returns", he said.
They are turning into a political issue, something that is entirely a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for Syria's recovery until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib allows for progress in political dialogues.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Mu'alem stressed, however, that the agreement has clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action will be directed at the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front, who will be destroyed.
UN Ambassador Stafan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, soon to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to the review of the members of the current constitution and warning that there should be no interference.
Why would Trump win a second term?
That's the logic behind Trump's re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal audiences probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!
There's no sign of viewer fatigue at this time.
Since 2014, the prime time rating has doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show tops the cable ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big-news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", says Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama "The Last Candidate", which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skwall, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Scowell told me he told her "Because it makes me laugh".
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Rowe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the good state of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to six hours of watching a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who used "profound historical information" as the source for his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's $15,000-priced cockpit jacket of shrimp leather (a "pull of arrogance" according to the Washington Post), and Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I especially will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make you feel like you're part of a reality show is give you a little bit each night", said Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pawn Stars, "in terms of changing cast and daily rotations (joining the National Football League, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I contacted Mr. Flyce this week, he was on the north shore of Kauai, sunny, 80 degrees, but he was locked in his home watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
I remember once we were doing all those silly shows and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization", Mr. Flies told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but they were right.

Investments are pouring into the most contentious race in the early election for a congressional seat.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is getting a stream of money from the reorganization of congressional districts, and from there, two winners for the same seat.
The recently redistributed Pittsburgh suburb district is named for Conservative Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb is facing another winner, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is significantly behind the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial dispute between the major party funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated March by-election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The position has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for its support for China, then withdrew.
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, over recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, Department spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only imposed on El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. drug aid for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its unemployment and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic well-being, which serves as a continuation of a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent an influx of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, the top authorities had made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will attend the conference scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the administration's emphasis on the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further strict announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who have agreed to remain anonymous and who have agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is currently substantial evidence in the public record.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our election.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body just as he prepares to face the electorate, and perhaps a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, nor is that of his kind in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, provided the West had backed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to escape the last years of the slaughter.
The course of history depends on such pivotal moments, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing several similar pivotal moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since that newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly write the president and speculated that he was not fit for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein has declared the story in The Times to be inaccurate.
What would we do if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh, requested by the FBI, was not complete or fair or if it was approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote in the early congressional elections if it forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of it.
But I believe we're not gonna fail because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table, carrying a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., and is the author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorance of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna confrontation.
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to advance from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorance from playing his first game of the season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a springboard for greater achievements.
"We've won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent", the 31-year-old shared.
We entered the game hoping we could win something and we left with a point.
We might even win at the end of the game, but overall, the draw looks fair.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
We've been looking forward to Thursday, another big night of our European games.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job last meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our audience we can do our best and get a good result.
Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team's good and the boys are having a lot of fun, and the training is really helpful.
I hope we can do our best to forget last season and achieve the desired results.
Women worry about their retirement savings
Although the participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few discussed it with family members.
About half of Nationwide's survey respondents say they have discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent have spoken to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven't taken steps to have this conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you have expressed your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family how and where you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions when choosing a long-term care financial institution may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the start.
Appoint a health care officer so that you have a specific trustee to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of an authorising officer for financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please provide these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but who the doctors will be", Martin asks.
What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, the aid organisations cannot obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palau that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palo Alto since the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palo and Donggala, which are located on Sulawesi Island:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach strip on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongla is a regency that stretches for more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) along the Sulawesi coast.
Regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Moravia, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palo and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Donggala.
Tsunamis also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on December 26 off the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A rabbit with a magnitude of 6.8 struck Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a 10-meter tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remember the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly from the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Trac Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Paylin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paylin is being held in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty, certainly, when he was asked to plead, the media reports.
Paylin is facing a three-time Class A misdemeanor, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and fined $250,000.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotic drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of People Killed
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media is rolling videos showing the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palo Alto when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saypov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people. A rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saypov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck at Home Depot to carry out the October bombing on a bike lane near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, gasping pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent in connection with the death penalty petition filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court filing, both charges could end in death.
Seven weeks after the attack, an expanded federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of racket-related murder commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a count of assault and destruction of a motor vehicle.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "horrible, cruel and perverse".
Saypov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas ClÃ©ves, An-Lori Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Earley, Ernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panukok, the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saypov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saypov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked his hospital room to display the ISIS flag, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge, which consists of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were obviously disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty verdict and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all those affected", Patton said.
Saypov's defense team has previously requested the prosecutor's office not to seek a death sentence.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize the People's Army today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should feel pressure as one of Theresa May's own party members suggested he lead the EU negotiations.
Peter Bon, the Conservative MP, said in Birmingham in March that Britain would have left by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to reconcile the deeply divided ranks of the party was highlighted by conservatives who supported staying who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his compromise plan Chequers, despite attacks from Brexit supporters, those who support staying and from the EU.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and urge Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and chaos.
Mr. Bon told the protesters with the slogan "Exit means exit" in Solihull that he wanted Chequers thrown.
He stressed that Mr Faraj should have been involved on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd have left by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan".
He declared his opposition to the EU, saying: 'We did not fight world wars to be serfs.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bon rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative spokeswoman Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular with our party and our activists who actually took to the streets and really helped us get elected.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.
In an open letter to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their positions when they keep their promises".
Mr Faraj told the rally that politicians should be under pressure if they want to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class", he said.
They're trying to change Brexit and we're here today to say we're not gonna let that get away with it.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, the remaining supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags with the words "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group launched this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues of the party's app when he opened up at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that we can deploy all the IT systems and all the technology in Canada and more, and more, for seamless border crossing, for free borderless trade in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren said he'd seriously consider running for president.
State Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic representative spoke about her future during a Western Massachusetts city council meeting on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Dyle, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She's at the center of speculation that she could take over Trump's job in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the city hall since Trump took office.
One of the presenters asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes women at the top.
He's under arrest for the death of Sims from LSU.
Baton Rouge, LA, police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a news conference at 11:00 a.m. eastern time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man who appears in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early Friday morning.
Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by the Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, to having a gun and to having shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is being held in custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6'6" youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, La., Sims appeared in 32 games with 10 starts as a starter last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped him beat Sebastian Fettel
Ever since Valter Botas took the lead over Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it's become clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team will play a significant role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously strained Hamilton while defending his position in the first two corners, thus allowing Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel made a pit stop first and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to his exit from the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and followed Fettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a bold maneuver and driving from tire to tire, forcing the Ferrari driver reluctantly to release the inside of the track to avoid a penalty with extra time after having already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double defensive maneuver on the third turn.
Back on his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
He then even led for a rather long period of the race, as he decided to change tyres later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually outrun Kimi Raikkonen in the battle for fourth place.
He finally entered the pit stop in round 44, but failed to score enough in the next eight rounds and eventually Rykonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me race him.
The team did an extraordinary job to win the first two podium seats, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her allegation that she did not distribute the letter from Christine Blazey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were angry and disgusting and dishonest.
What can happen and the good thing that's happened these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and bad and disgusting and dishonest, he said.
When you look at the press and the circulation, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
You know what?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread it?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I haven't been spreading.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread, he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September, but Feinstein denies that the distribution occurred from her office.
"I have not covered up Ford's claims, I have not spread her story", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep a secret and I kept a secret, as she wanted.
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally Saturday night: "I'll tell you that was a very bad body language.
She may not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's plaintiff accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president stressed that the Democrats were using the claims for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
Look at the dishonesty, the shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to regain power and control, the president said, according to Mediaite.
The Dundee Stars are 5-3 with the Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars are back for their Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday, beating Dundee 5-3 in a rematch on Saturday.
The Giants led early in the game with two goals after beating Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowielier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kawhi tied for the hosts before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Boucher tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals confirmed their win.
This is the third Elite League win for Adam Kieff's boys who came out of the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between the two rivals this season, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
The strike that Dwyer opened the scoring came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul assisting, and then David Rutherford doubled the lead, assisting Bowie four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan put the hosts back in the game at 1:10 p.m., before Matt Markart helped tie the game with Kawhi at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to lead the Giants before the first break, scoring the second goal of the night late in the first half.
The homeowners regrouped and Buschar again tied the odds with a powerful knock on the door at 27:37.
Kawhi and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee his first lead of the game late in the second half, as he gave his best and cemented the team's victory with a fifth goal in the middle but last half.
The Giants, who have lost their last four games of a combined five, are hosting Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant died to make sure hundreds of people aboard a plane could escape the earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers on board managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are still unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
The strong secondary earthquakes continued to hit the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Pallu.
Although his colleagues ran to save his life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly-quickly-quaking control tower at Muteara Sisi Al-Jufri airport.
He remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he decided he was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Control spokesman Johannes Sirate, Indonesia, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palo.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to Donggala, Sigi and Butong cities was restricted.
"We expect the death toll to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people cannot be reached", said Sutopo spokesman Purvo Nugarho.
Waves reaching six meters devastated Palo, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There are looting everywhere in the minamarket.
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's a tragedy already, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and addressed the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by the earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that a man has been missing since a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been reported missing after earlier stating that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon, it has been prohibited to contact a male passenger.
The airline added that it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their efforts to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, authorities announced that seven people were admitted to hospital.
The airline said all six passengers remained in hospital Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American Bill Jens, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane came in very low.
"This is incredibly beautiful", says Jane.
Jane's story is that he and the others managed to slide through the deep to the shallow water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says that sailors repairing a nearby dock also helped with the rescue operation by using a floating boat to get people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Safe Aviation Network indicate that over the past two decades 111 people have died on flights with airlines registered to PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any case.
Analyst's showing the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution closed its presentation of the case this Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice has testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones indicating that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy is that Telis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett pointed out that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
He's erased her from his life, Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip hop trio wants to provoke negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip-hop has deviated from its origins of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and promote conscious hip-hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are being revived in the UK through acts like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nanny suing a couple after being fired for a racist message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a misrepresented message from her mother who complains she's the average black woman.
The couple denies being racist, calling the demands blackmail.
Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman, a mother of two, was stunned to learn that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
A young, ordinary black woman, texting her husband's name by Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and she did it twice.
After realizing her mistake, the embarrassed Mrs. Plasco-Flacksman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid a day's wages and then sent home in a taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for the firing, asking for $350 a day for the six-month contract she was originally hired for, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, you know, you shouldn't do that", she told the Post on Friday, adding that she was sure it was discrimination.
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that terminating Morris' employment was the sensible move, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, said Post's husband Joel Plasto.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it.
Comparing the request to a blackmail, Plasto claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
That's not very nice, the investment banker added.
While the case is still pending, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, denouncing their behavior and logic.
The publishers of the Paddington were worried that readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, tells of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes who reads a book for the first time before it's published.
Now that we know about Paddington's huge success, it's a lot of fun.
She shared that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little bear-toy, would have felt optimistic about the book's eventual rejection, adding that he is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book with mixed feelings after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as an important member of our family, she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a rather modest man and not a self-assuming man", she said.
But since Paddington felt so real, it's like having a child who's accomplished something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your thing.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"He kept calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn't expect to survive", Mrs. Ednan-Laperois shared.
And then Nad called me to say she was gonna die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She left a while ago, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have tightened up.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz, who still mourns the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what a trial she was going through.
"No one understood", she shares.
I'd bowed my head and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this pervasive sense of compassion for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her.
Women mourning put up cards to prevent suicide from a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent more suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are putting up on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she shares.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Liddy, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lights up every room.
But he quit his job before he left, and he found himself in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis shared: "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences.
Mrs. Davis creates these cards so people know that they have someone to go to and talk to, even if that's a friend.
Don't keep silent. You have to talk.
Mrs. Humphries, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, loses Mark, her life partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn't share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else, she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He got to the bottom of Christmas when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look at them, or anything.
She shared that it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: "It opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must move forward and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question after the FBI begins an investigation.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants  investigation with a limited duration and scope  maybe we could unite our efforts, Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would dissolve despite the reinforced over-party blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is about the moment itself.
The early election is only five weeks away, on November 6th. If the Republicans don't perform as well as expected, their attempts to elect their representative to the state's highest court will be seriously hurt.
George W. Bush calls on senators to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and with his help meets his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
There's going to be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 Senate votes that will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees is falling under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker claims the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beyong Sug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Refugee Affairs, said that there were 1127 refugees last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, were key factors.
There's been no official comment from Pyongyang.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually become citizens of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stagnation of nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work on a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to first unilaterally disarm ourselves", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for a Supreme Court position.
Congressional Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted this way, they would have called her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and feeling off when discussing his family and his student years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on the person" organized by liberals who were unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unable to serve on the Supreme Court because it was clear he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he persecutes the Clinton family and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
I'll put it this way. If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to enter the Supreme Court, but the court he's in now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Rowe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and expect us to say, "Is it great?"
Women need to be in control, too.
That's a well-founded criticism, after months and years of raging anger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Staynam told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I got a huge help from a woman who was a CEO somewhere, who shared that she cried when she was angry, but she developed her own technique, which when she got angry and cried, she told her interlocutor, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then it just goes on.
I thought that was brilliant.
Tears are allowed in the expression of anger, in part because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of my previous work, in an office mostly with men, is that once, as I was frowning with inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck, a frozen manager, whom I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did it to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me 30 years later, laughing.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was for another one to show up.
Someone called the situation "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since she's late for the campaign, she's lagging behind in fundraising and decides she won't stay in the race if she doesn't manage to raise $2 million.
The battle is pre-condemned to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters who give $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with feelings  gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and to be able to address the voters rather than the delegates, and anger at sexism that she became angry.
"One might think I had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalls the media reaction.
"One might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
She's crying?
How the US-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were daunting, and while the battle is still gaining momentum, a break between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has issued his first warning this year, taxing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion in production, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time Beijing returned with countervailing new tariffs of five to ten percent of US goods worth 60 billion US dollars.
China has vowed to respond to every blow to the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is not expected to ignore that anytime soon.
To make Washington give up is to yield to demands, but to bring a head down in public before Washington would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political solution in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow for Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria has declared its readiness for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in rebuilding the war-torn country that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem stressed that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to restore areas devastated by terrorists to their normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in rebuilding the devastated state.
But he stressed that no conditional support or aid would be accepted from countries that have funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
So the US has six straight losses on European soil and hasn't won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the tournament championship after the team led by Danish captain Thomas BjÃ¶rn reached the necessary 14.5 points to secure victory over the United States.
The US star, Phil Mickelson, who performed poorly for most of the tournament, threw his first hit on the 16th hole (with a par 3) into the water, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari performed well in all rounds, becoming one of only four players in the history of the tournament to reach a 5-0-0 record since the competition was held in its current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5&4 to the lowest-placed player in the European team  TorbjÃ¶rn Olesen from Denmark.
World champion Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, for whom this is probably the last Ryder Cup appearance.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most points in the tournament of all time, raising his asset to 25.5 points this year.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can lift the cup again.
The team is the most important thing, and I'm happy to have been able to help, said the excited Garcia after winning Europe.
He's passing the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and his overall Ryder Cup record is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, a score that only Jack Nicklaus can beat.
The U.S. team was struggling all weekend except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we were pressing the European team.
There was a fight.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
We're gonna regroup, discuss important issues with the Professional Golfers Association of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're just going to look ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't help but take your hat off to the opponent.
We were just up.
Red tide news: Concentration is decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Committee shows a substantial decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions for slowing growth in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties  this indicates a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide's exaggerated flowering waters stretch for about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
Sections of algae can be seen 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they're less than last week.
Red tide is also seen in Pasco County.
Over the past week, there have been reports of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or slightly inland in Pinellas County, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsborough County, prerequisites for high concentrations in Manatee County, prerequisites for high concentrations on the coast or inland in Sarasota County, prerequisites for moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, prerequisites for high concentrations on the coast or inland in Librey County, and low concentrations in Cooley County.
There are still reports of airway inflammation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of airway inflammation in Northwest Florida in the past week.
