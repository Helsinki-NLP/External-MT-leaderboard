Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about looking like Moffat.
There is some debate among MPs over the proposal to change their titles to MWPs (MPs of Wales).
This was due to plans to change the name of the parliament to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this could lead to a mockery.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the term "Twp" was a synonym for "Twp".
For readers outside Wales: in Wales twp means fool and pwp means dirty.
A member of parliament from the Pled party stated that he was not happy overall and suggested alternative terms.
The Conservative Party of Wales stated that its party had a "free mind" about the name change, but stressed that it was a short-lived change from MWP to Moopet.
In this sense, the Welsh letter w is similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire letter u.
The House Committee, which is currently preparing a draft law on the name change, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what the members of the House refer to is naturally an important matter for the members themselves.
The Welsh Government's 2017 resolution gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that included broad support for the parliamentary term of the Parliament of Wales.
As for the MP title, the Commission wanted the title of WMPs, but the MWP option had broad public consultation support.
Apparently the members of the House of Commons offer alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus is a headache for Speaker Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to the House of Commons within weeks.
The Act on Amendments includes other changes to the way Parliament works, including provisions on the removal of parliamentary powers and the drafting of a committee system.
Members of Parliament will vote in the final vote on the title to be applied when debating the law.
Some Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was planned after decades of efforts to resolve the dispute with Greece, which has a separate province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Giorgio Ivanov, opposed the referendum on renaming, saying he did not consider voting.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is only the cost of EU and NATO membership.
With the efforts of the churches in Harlem, the bells of St. Martin's are silenced.
"Historically, the old men I spoke to say there was a pub and a church around every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there are none".
He said the disappearance of the pubs was understandable.
He stated that these days "people are becoming social in different ways".
"Cottages are no longer co-location living rooms where people go regularly".
Regarding churches, he was concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets would not last as long as leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return to where they started".
He added that churches would be replaced by rescue buildings with shared apartments so that people would live there who do not help with the remnants of churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, and thus the day will come when all these churches are completely closed because it seems unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches", he said.
Both churches were built by white churchgoers, before Harlem became a large black city in 1870 - a decade after the city's large community, St. Martin's.
The original white settlers left the Methodist Church in the 1930s.
And they called a black man who sat by the house of worship, and they called his name.
ST Martin was ousted by a black coach led by Rev. John Harvard Johnson, who led a retail strike on Route 125, the main vendor road in Harlem; a person who opposed the hiring or promotion of blacks.
In 1939 a fire severely damaged the building, but members of the local Johnson-Father church decided to rebuild the building, so they used the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and successor at St. Martin's, honored Carillon with the term "the poor man's backs".
The scholar who called Carillon in July called it another term: "cultural heritage" and "historical homelessness".
Tiffany Angie, an expert at the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first stage carillon played by a black musician, Dionysius E. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether stated that S.T. Martin would not replace him.
What has been played out in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complex narrative of architects and contractors, some of whom have been introduced by non-clergy church leaders and others by the episcopal realm.
The church assembly halls  the governing bodies of the church, which consist of non-clergy leaders  wrote to the church assembly halls in July, concerned that the church would "be in a position to expand along the coasts", even though the church assembly halls did not play a role in the leases of architects and contracts that the church territory sent them.
Some members of the church complained about the lack of transparency in the church's territory.
A shark in California injured a 13-year-old child while diving for a labster
According to authorities, a shark injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving at a labster in California on the opening day of the labster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the Bacon Beach in Incinitas.
Chad Hamil told KSWB TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving since about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when they heard a child screaming for help, and they rushed to him with a group of divers to get him out of the water.
Hamil stated that at first he thought it was just an excitement to get a lapster, but then he "realized that the baby was screaming", "I was trapped!
I have been taken captive!"
The whole door was open", said Hamil, who suddenly realized she had taken the baby.
And I called out to them, and they came out of the water; and she said, Behold, a shark is in the water.
The boy was taken to the Radio Children's Hospital in San Diego and placed on the critical list.
The nature of the attacking shark was unknown.
The Rescue Guards, Captain Larry Gillis, told reporters at a press conference that a shark had arrived a few weeks earlier but did not appear to be a dangerous shark.
Gillis added that the victim survived the injuries sustained in the high-half-lying areas.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Isinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Gillies stated that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sensorys is planning to put pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sensorys is competing with Boots, SuperDrag and Debinhams by creating interior corridors for a makeup store run by expert colleagues.
As part of a push to the UK £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which is growing amid falling sales of cosmetics and home goods, cosmetics corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be adapted to more stores next year.
Cosmetic investments are made in a situation where supermarkets are following suit to use the empty front door locks that were once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sensorys said it would double its cosmetics volume for the first time by offering 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and PawPaw.
L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will also occupy a lot of space in comparison to branded departments similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
Supermarket is also reactivating the small store line design so that most products for vegetarians are convenient and are increasingly sought after by newcomers.
Furthermore, fragrance retailers from Fergrance Shop are testing patents at two Sensorys stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, while the second in Silly Oak, Birmingham will open later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to low-quality food from local convenience stores means that supermarkets will have to spend more effort to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Copp, CEO of Sensoress, said stores will increasingly look like state-owned stores as supermarket chains struggle to compete against discount holders like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and no food.
Sensorys is placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of residences since it bought both stores two years ago, which it says has increased sales and made the business more profitable.
Previous efforts by Supermarket to refurbish the cosmetics and pharmaceutical sectors failed.
Sensorys tried a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but their partnership ended after a dispute over how to split capital from chemical stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sensorbury sold its 281 pharmacies to Silicon Valley, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded portfolio of facial cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Miles-Hicks, Cessonsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, commented: "We have changed our perspective and feel about cosmetic corridors to make the environment better for our customers.
We also invested in our specialised trainees who are available to provide advice.
Our line of brands are designed to meet all needs and attractive environments and comfortable locations means that we are now a compelling destination for cosmetics that challenge the old ways of selling".
Peter Jones's "disappearance" after Hallie Willowbaugh pulled out of the £11 million deal
Peter Jones star Dragos Den has announced his departure from the £11 million home appliance brand after the departure of TV executive Hallie Willowboy to focus on a contract with Marks, Spencer and TV I, "Flashed".
Willowboy does not have time for the brand of trowel wear and home furnishings.
The business of these two partners was similar to the company's Guppe Guinette Palletto brand.
This morning, Turn 37 announced on Instagram that it was going out.
Hallie Willowby has angered the star of Dragos Den by leaving the profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her big contracts with Marks and Spencer and TV I, Peter Jones.
Sources say that when Golden Girls TV admitted during a test session on Tuesday at the head office of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new deal worth £1.5 million meant she didn't have enough time to hand over the clothing and homeware brand to Trolli, making Jones "disappeared".
The same business was the brand of the company Guppe Gwyneth Paltrow, which doubled Willowby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
As Willowby 37 announced his departure from Trolley on Instagram, Jones quickly left the UK for a holiday in one of his homes.
A source stated: "So far, trolling has been one of the top priorities of Halley.
This probably set a long-term future for him that would await him in the next few decades.
His decision to leave has shocked everyone who worked with him.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday was about to begin.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlowe's central office that are ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of this morning's turning point, the person who is among the UK's biggest investors, has been significantly affected by the company's massive investment in products ranging from candles to dresses and homewares worth millions of dollars and further delays in its start-up.
And it can mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willowboy, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
In 2016, Willowboy founded Trolley with Cap and 52-year-old Jones joined in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin Television Productions.
Willowby is set to become a representative of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm a Celebrity on TV I.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his trade".
"We fell in love with each other".
He joked about criticism from the news media that some might consider it "inappropriate for the presidency" and his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump jokingly voiced the "newscaster".
"I have left nothing behind".
Kim expressed interest in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which was welcomed by Trump as a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But nuclear disarmament talks have been stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ryang Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Monday that North Korea had not seen a "reciprocal response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he stated that the United States would continue to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump had a very optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
"If we went to war with North Korea,
Millions were killed.
Now we have these great relationships".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, ended rocket tests, helped release hostages and allowed the remaining American crew to return home.
And he defended his unusual approach to conversations related to Kim's relationship.
It's easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into the enclosed space, we're going to have about 200 people there", Trump said, referring directly to the crowd.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island and left hundreds dead
After the Lumbok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was unemployed, the state of national crisis, which calls for the acceleration of international aid, has not been declared.
"Unfortunately, in most cases, the people have been very clear about not needing international assistance, which is a bit challenging", Ms. Sambang said.
While the Institute of Child Protection is organizing a team to travel to Palo, there is no certainty whether foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr. Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Crisis Administration, said Indonesian officials were investigating the situation in Palau to allow international agencies to cooperate in relief efforts.
Given the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they do not have a common field of view across the coastline.
Although there was a warning, the absence of an alarm clock in Palo Alto is likely to have caused casualties.
At the most opportune times, travel between Indonesia and some of its islands can be challenging.
Natural disasters complicate the logistics process.
A planetary hospital on board the ship, which was based in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, is moving to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster site.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on rebuilding destroyed infrastructure and allocated the funds to roads and railroads.
But the budget deficit disrupted Mr. Joko's administration even as he faced re-election next year.
Mr. Jokowi continues to face pressures from persistent sectarian differences in Indonesia, as followers of the Muslim majority follow traditional scary readings.
Christian and Muslim mobs on the roads used sautars, arrows, and other light weapons to kill more than 1,000 people and displaced tens of thousands more.
See: Daniel Sturridge scored the equalization of the Premier League against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by one point in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Zidran Sugar by 0-1 when he was about 30 yards behind Chelsea's goal.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting the goal.
With this attack, the ball was thrown higher than the penalty area and then turned to the right and up the net.
Eventually, the ball fell over the top of the kipa arizaballaga, which was leaping, and then entered the net.
"It was just an attempt to get the ball in that position, and the players were always as busy as possible, so I just tried to take the initiative as much as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant coming in and he just made a call before he thought much about it".
Chelsea took the first 0-1 lead in halftime after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eidine Hazard.
In the process, the blue-footed forward passed the ball backwards to Matthew Kvassik before moving into Liverpool's midfield near the centre of the field.
Kvassik took it to action and ran towards the halfway point.
He then threw the ball straight, which led the 1000s into the penalty area.
The thousandth of a second advanced from the defense and threw the ball into the vertical arrow with a single left foot kick while Allison Baker overtook Liverpool.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will play Videoton on Thursday at 3pm in the UEFA Europa League.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll increased to 832
According to the Crisis Administration statements on Sunday morning, the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
A large number of people were reportedly trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings due to a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and whose waves spread to 20 feet, the Sotopo Portogruho said at a news conference.
The city of Palo, with a population of 380,000, has collapsed with the remains of destroyed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation into the murder began this morning after a woman's body was discovered in Breckinid, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was discovered at 7.55am on Grayson Moose Road, John Road, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people of the area to testify to what they had seen and heard.
Discovery inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages and I urge all those who were near John Road in Breckinade and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have taken a camera-recorded image to contact us because they may have information that is very important to our investigation.
A police spokesman admitted that the woman whose body was discovered was a resident of Breckinid and was found inside a building.
After dinner today, some of the woman's friends arrived at the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
Police are investigating allegations that close relatives of the victim are being informed.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Moose was returning to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he came to know what had happened, he was silent.
Residents of the building were told that it would take hours for them to be allowed in.
A police officer was reportedly talking to a man who is believed to have been the scene of an accident throughout the area.
There was another woman with tears flowing in the scene.
He repeated, "It's terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police cars were stopped, one inside the seat belt and the other outside.
A number of officers were inside the security belt and were monitoring the apartment blocks.
All persons with information are requested to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers without identification by calling 111 555 0800 with log 247 on September 30.
Tandis Kramoul is the last memorial in parliament to be the target of the "rewrite of history" scandal.
His exile would be a just punishment in exchange for the destruction of the Taliban's cultural and religious heritage in England by his fanatical and fundamentalist followers.
But the Cramol Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cramol Society, said: "It was impolite in the ongoing debate over the disappearance of the pendants that perhaps one day the statue of Oliver Cramol would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cramwell did not order or carry out the break-up of the English Civil War.
In fact, Cramol's mistake is that he was a victim of the actions of his predecessors, such as Thomas in the last century.
A glorious retelling of William Hammock's Tornicroft's Cramole testifies to 19th-century views and is part of the narrative history of a personality that most believe to be worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps in the late 19th century, Cramole was seen by many as a parliamentary defender against foreign pressure, compared to today; and in his day he was certainly known as the king.
Whether this expression is fully valid is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
The important point is that the war of the mid-17th century marked successive developments in our nation, and Cramol is a distinctive individual who represents one side of the conflict.
His works are worthy of glory and honour, and his works are worthy of honor.
A pig bit a Chinese farmer and killed him.
According to local media reports, a farmer in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The South China Morning News reported on Sunday that the body of the man, whose nickname was "Yan", was found near a bullring in the market town of Leopanchiu, Guizhou State, with heavy bleeding and drowning.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai, China, a farmer was preparing to inject a vaccine into pigs in a herd of pigs.
Reports said she had arrived at the market with her son from the Greek state of Hellenic Arabia on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
And it came to pass in the morning, when his son-in-law saw the dead body of his son, that he saw the door of the gate open at the entrance of Towale.
He stated that there was a large male pig in the tail while its mouth was bloody.
According to the report, a medical trial confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds had torn the farmer's male to pieces and killed them.
The evening news newspaper Guyang quoted the man's cousin who nicknamed "Wu" as saying, "My cousin's legs were bloody and torn".
Security belts images show Yan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
Her body was discovered an hour later.
The beast that kills the man shall not be his son or his son.
Director Marquette told the Evening News that while police were gathering evidence at the scene, a farther pig was enclosed to prevent an animal from attacking others.
It was reported that Yan's family and Marquette's officials were negotiating a cash reward in exchange for his death.
Although such incidents are rare, there have been previously recorded instances of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, severely injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife scared the animal to run away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not generally aggressive but taste blood like "a mouse".
"They're just for fun.
They're little boys, they're very curious... they're not after you.
You have to respect them properly", he added.
The effects of the storm will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, the sea typhoon has weakened daily as it moves towards the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will cause heavy rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time on Saturday, Rosa had winds of 85 mph and was classified as a Category 1 storm, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a mid-wave in the Pacific Ocean will begin to form and flow eastward along the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will begin to press the extreme pressure of tropical moisture northward toward the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, parts of Mexico will receive 10 inches of rainfall.
Then, during the coming days, tropical moisture, interacting with nearby waves, will form extensive, heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, destructive landslides and possible landslides in deserts.
Extreme tropical humidity causes precipitation to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
About 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern regions, especially most of Arizona.
It is possible that due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall, rapidly worsening conditions can occur as flooding intensifies.
It would be highly unwise to walk out into the desert without caution in situations where there is a risk of tropical rain.
And the rain shall be like a sea of tumult, and the thunder shall be like a thunderstorm, and the winds of the earth shall be like a whirlwind.
Amid the nearby waves, heavy local rainfall will occur in some areas of the coast of Southern California.
There is a total possibility of more than half an inch of rainfall, which can cause dirt to flow and roads to become cloudy.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Late Sunday and early Monday before rain spreads late Monday and Tuesday, some tropical rain-dispersed eruptions begin to approach Arizona.
And it shall rain on the third day, and it shall be heavy rain on the fourth day, and it shall be heavy rain on the fourth day.
October will see extreme temperature fluctuations in the United States as the North Pole gets colder but tropical regions will remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to sudden changes in temperature over short periods of time.
On Sunday, a prominent example of sudden temperature differences will occur across the central United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will resume and rise.
Most of the central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to see a warm start with a range of 80 from the southern plains to the northeastern regions.
New York City will reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Throughout the first half of October in the eastern United States, our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance of higher-than-average temperatures.
More than 20 million people watched the court session of Bert Kavanagh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people witnessed the testimony of influencer Bert Kavanagh and a woman in the Supreme Court who accused her of sexual harassment, which apparently occurred in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political blockade continued with the interruption of the regular Friday program with a sudden last-minute change of situation: a draft agreement was submitted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was having an affair with her while drunk and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanagh said in her emotional testimony that she was 100 percent sure that this incident did not happen.
Nelson reported that it was likely viewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculates the average statistics of the viewing through CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
Other networks, including PBS, CPN and the commercial network Fox, which displayed it, had no data available.
And Nelson typically has trouble counting people he sees in offices.
If imagined, this would be similar to the attendance at a football final or an academic award ceremony.
Nielsen stated that Fox News, which analysts strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, was the leading channel with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day of the court session.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest continued to rise after the meeting.
In Friday's Majra, Fleck was the main character.
After the Republican midterms issued a statement saying he would vote in Kavanagh's favor, he was targeted by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he climbed into the courtroom to attend a committee meeting and protesters shouted at him.
He stood up for a few minutes and closed his eyes, severely affected by the accusations and CNN's live broadcast.
A woman shouted, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
Do ye think that he will tell the truth to the nation?
And it was said unto her, Thou art strong, but most women are not strong.
Flake said his office issued a statement and added that he would have more to say at the committee meeting before the roll was closed.
Hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to increase the voting power to a Senate majority for Kavanagh's nomination, cable and television broadcasts covered it live.
But Flick said he would only do so by agreeing that the FBI would address the charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority insists on.
Flick was relatively convinced by the comments of his friend, Senator Chris Connors of the Democratic Party.
Flick made the decision after talking to Knesset and later with a number of other senators.
Flick's choice was powerful, as it was clear that Republicans did not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has ordered an investigation into the allegations against Kavanagh by the FBI.
British Prime Minister accused critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the EU of "playing politics" and the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
Theresa May will continue to hold the British Prime Minister's meeting in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview in the same issue of the newspaper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson overturned his so-called Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other was "very ridiculous".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrested Daywin Simpson for suspected murder of an LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wade Sims on suspicion of murdering a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Officials posted a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his body during a civil war.
The CBS affiliate W.E.F.B. reported that police had found the glasses at the scene of the accident and admitted that they had discovered Simpson's DNA in it.
Police said after questioning Simpson that he confessed to the fatal shooting.
The defense lawyer said the amount was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Cemetery Department on Friday published an initial report stating that the cause of the murder was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police Force for tracking the fugitive offender, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and the local community for their cooperation in the investigation that led to the arrest of the offender.
LSU's sports director, Joy Aliva, thanked law enforcement for "seeking and enforcing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the deaths of Wade killed the teams of the Gatch and the Teaneaters.
"This is not something you always worry about", Wade said.
A volcano erupted over Mexico City
Ashes recovered from the Popocatpetal volcano have reached the southern neighbor of Mexico City.
After the volcano erupted from the crater, the National Center for Crisis Prevention warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano on Saturday and stabilized 183 emissions of gas and ash within 24 hours.
The center monitors multiple eclipses and vibrations.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash covered in windshields of cars in Mexico City, such as the Zuchimilco area.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that rocked central Mexico in September 2017, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The famous Don Guo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six were arrested on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-insurgency police and while thousands of people were taking part in protests against the first controversial anniversary of the secessionist vote.
The riot police threw masks, eggs and powdered powder at a group of independence activists, causing a black thunderstorm on the roads, which is usually a tourist attraction.
Late in the day, protesters also clashed with police, which led to police using hand tools to prevent clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Forget not, forgive not", in response to the cry of the pro-union protesters "Live the Spanish Wind".
According to local media reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after my referendum on October 1, which Madrid declared illegal but welcomed by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region's belief in independence continue to rise.
Voters voted for independence with a clear majority, although turnout was low and voters opposed the vote.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block voting in polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
Independence groups held a tent tent on Friday night to prevent protests in support of the National Police.
The protests continued but under pressure they were forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Thirmis, 68, an electrician who took part in the protests with his wife, said he no longer hopes for the chance of Catalonia's independence.
He added: "Last year we were at the best of times.
I saw my parents crying because they were happy to vote, but now we're confused".
Last December, despite managing a fateful and even minor victory in regional elections, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain their resolve with most of their known leaders either from voluntary exile or from detention pending trial for allegedly participating in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Pugh, a 42-year-old Egyptian who recorded protests supporting the police over the phone, said the clashes were being sparked by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting more and more confusing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Jancueras, one of the non-Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
He said, "Standing as a candidate in the European elections will be the best way to reverse the repressive democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government".
London Gate: Several men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly collided with a house in London.
The news of the incident was published on Thursday at 19:30 BST in Ballinaagur Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blimings stated that the gates and the building itself were destroyed.
Some parts of the motorway were also hit by archery.
A 0-1 draw by Minga against Rangers scored the winning goal for Livingston.
Minga's first goal in favor of Livingston kept the win.
Livingston, who had risen through the ranks, was rocked by a Rangers defeat, the team's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Iburux.
The Minga's goal kick established the distinction as the Warriors' side Halt finished second to the Hibernates.
The receiver remained undefeated for the championship this season and will face Leeds Hertz, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues to advance unabated in the division to six games under head coach Halt since he succeeded Kenny Miller last month, who is still set to suffer a defeat.
Livingston lost the chance to Blunt Visitor.
Halt's team had to progress well before they could score points, also with a management that created all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson crossed the obstacles but changed course along the goal, then Alan Litgo managed to manage his effort only in a marginal manner after slipping to prevent Craig Halckett from hitting the head on the goal.
The host team was satisfied with the Rangers' performance against them, although they knew they had the ability to capture the team in specific scenes.
This is where the fateful trick happened.
Rangers gave up one free-kick and Livingston was busy with the opening moves, with Diclan Gallagher and Robinson both trying to force a slow-kick and a point from the middle.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the standings but the main defense was unbeatable and goalkeeper Liam Keeley was certainly not concerned.
This situation continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos defended to avoid a goal kick.
The Scott Pittman forward was defended by Rangers goalkeepers Alan McGregor and Lithgow with a wide kick from the game.
The move continued steadily to Livingston Field, which was continually defended, although two penalties were rejected by reference after Halkitt's claim to Glen Middleton as a substitute, and one for Hindball.
"Fantastic" by Livingston
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony McCarthy Square
An extraordinary performance and result for Livingston.
For one man, these were great, and the climb continued to surpass expectations.
The way the players played and their performances changed little since returning to the top flight, but the most points were returned to Halt when he entered the field due to his motivation for the team.
He had several heroes.
Captain Halckett was excellent, managing a very regular defense while Minga had worried Connor Goldson and Joy Veral during the match.
Although Rangers lacked inner motivation.
They were so good when they were under the supervision of a recruit, they don't have those standards now.
They were without the final ball  They only opened the main wing once  and it was something like a wake-up call for the Rangers who found themselves in a safe place.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, with laughter and imagination.
This is the last day of President Erdoğan's visit to Germany, which aims to rebuild relations between NATO allies.
They were concerned about issues such as human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdoğan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new large mosque.
It hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens living outside Turkey.
Police prevented a large crowd of 25,000 from entering the mosque for security reasons, but a large majority of supporters gathered to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests were different from the one that reflected the split in which the German Turks welcomed the visitor as a hero and the other side called him an outlaw and a disgrace.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: Cyclist killed in a collision with a motorcycle
In London, a cyclist was killed in a car accident.
The incident occurred at 10:15 BST near the intersection of Bistwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The incident came months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on the Childers Road, about a mile away from the scene on Saturday.
The city police said their officers were identifying the man and informing his relatives.
The roadblock and bus routes were changed and riders were directed to motorcycles to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the riot
The prison administration said that six prison officials were wounded in the riots at the men's prison, which is under strict security measures.
The riot began around 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still ongoing.
Special forces from Tornado entered the scene to contain the riot, which included eight prisoners and a building wing.
The officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Special trained personnel have been deployed to prevent the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prison, and we firmly state that those responsible for the incident have been referred to the police and will be held in detention for longer".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was hospitalized after a prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, the riot police were asked to quell a violent riot in which workers were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Lake City with flooding (dry areas will be affected)
It is rare for a tropical storm to hit Arizona, but this is exactly what is likely to happen as soon as possible next week as the energy of the sea typhoon daily flows southwest along the desert, posing the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has now issued flood warning warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, which will extend to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Ottawa, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected to make its direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, which will be approached by rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix stated in a tweet that "since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or collapse status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane on the Arizona border about 40 miles away".
The latest National Hurricane Administration forecasts 2 to 4 inches of rainfall and up to 6 inches of rainfall in remote areas such as the Arizona Mohawk Mountains.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall is likely to be 1 to 2 inches and in remote areas, up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the daily rain will be a blessing for those who are in the area of drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern and because the Southeast is already experiencing a drought situation, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial.
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, only over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least one severe drought, the second longest category", weather.com reported.
The path of the storm Rosa leads to a landing along the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
It is moving northward at a speed of 12 miles per hour, with maximum winds of 85 mph and strongest on Sunday morning, 385 miles further south towards Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
In the Pacific Ocean, the storm has been hit by cold water and its strength is weakening.
Therefore, a severe thunderstorm is expected to hit Mexico in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico will pose a serious risk of flooding.
Weather.com reported that "a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possible rainfall of up to 10 inches".
After that, the tropical storm will move northward along Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then will make its way from Arizona to southern Outaouais late Tuesday night.
"The major anticipated hazards or impacts of the storm are heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flooding to occur, flowers and mud to flow in the deserts and mountains to fall in the mountain slopes.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenage boy was found injured at 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior area of Thires-Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where his health is "good".
Police in Avon and Somerset said that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
The officials have asked all those who have photographed the incident by telephone to testify.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been "taken from the post office and the rage" of the Democratic Party
Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, South Virginia, that "the vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and violent tactics".
Trump said Kavanagh had been "misused and angered" by the Democratic Party during his candidacy process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress and strongly and emotionally denied the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually abused her when she was a teenager decades ago.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American people saw talent, merit and courage" in Kavanagh that day.
Addressing a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia, he said, "The vote to approve Judge Kavanaugh's vote to approve one of the most hard-working legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a valuable public service record".
The President, while discussing the importance of the Republican rally in the midterm elections, made a marginal mention of Kavanagh's candidacy issue.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running for office, I'm actually running".
"That's why I fight for the right candidate everywhere".
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and deterrence".
A senior deputy to the GOP leadership board told CNN that the first key trial vote on Kavanagh's nomination is expected to be held in the Senate chamber by Friday.
Hundreds of people were killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, deaths are increasing
Officials said on Saturday that a massive wave that hit the coast and caused an earthquake and tsunami to hit Sulawesi island in Indonesia killed at least 384 people and left many dead.
On Friday, while hundreds of people were gathering at a festival in the city of Palo, a six-meter (18-foot) high wave hit the beach, causing darkness, dragging many to death lines and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Sotopo Pororo Nogrovo, spokesman for the Indonesian Natural Disaster Reduction Agency BNPB, said at a news conference in Jakarta that "when the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately escape, thus becoming victims".
"The tsunami was not alone, it carried cars, logs, houses and smashed everything on the ground", said Nogroho, adding that the tsunami was running at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) along the open ocean before hitting the coast.
And he said, Some of the people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami, and they were saved.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo Alto.
Space images published by the Natural Disasters Agency showed a large number of destroyed buildings and shops, bridges being torn down and destroyed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On the following Saturday, the seismic activity continued to shake the coastal city.
The earthquake pattern was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the force disseminated by the severe earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
He noted that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long narrow bay, has increased the volume of the tsunami.
Nogrovo described the destruction as "gross", stating that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of several victims were found trapped under the walls of the buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nogruho said that along the 300 kilometres (190 mi) coastline north of Palo, the area known as Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, there will be more casualties and damage.
Nogrovo stated that communications were "fully paralyzed and informative" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people were residing there, adding that staff and volunteers were being dispatched to the crisis areas.
"It's a tragedy right now, but it's going to get worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami that hit Palo, although officials said the waves reached within the time the warning was issued.
In a non-literal tape posted on social media, a man's voice was heard from the roof of a building, warning with a loud cry of a tsunami approaching people on the road below.
Within minutes, a dam collided with the beach and destroyed buildings and motorways.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the tape.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages and communications, which caused the authorities to have difficulty coordinating rescue efforts.
According to military officials, relief cargoes have begun to be sent from Jakarta and other cities, but rescued people are in dire need of food and other basic needs.
The airport of the famous city reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to meet on Sunday from the evacuation centers in Palo Alto.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rose to more than 800
This is terrible.
Mr. Doshiba said that while World Vision employees safely arrived in the city of Palo from Donggala, where they were busy installing tents on their office premises, they passed through the devastating scenes along the way.
He said, "They told me that they saw houses that were all destroyed".
That's very bad.
Although aid groups were taking steps to help with the problem, some complained that travel by foreign aid specialists to Palo was prevented.
According to Indonesian regulations, equipment financing and recruitment from abroad is only possible if the crisis site is declared a national crisis zone.
This has never happened before.
Olia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said, "This is still a state-level crisis".
"When the government says, 'Yes, this is a national crisis,' we can provide international assistance, but this legal situation has not yet emerged".
While the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami passed, the friends and family of the missing persons still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously able to change the unpleasant lines of the natural disaster story.
On Saturday, a four-year-old boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman with her mother's body lying next to her and trapped under the covers for two days.
Gindo Subanduno, coach of the Indonesian national chess team, trained two of the missing chess players for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were trapped at the hotel, including Mr. Mandangi, were his disciples.
"As a competitor in the chess section, I carry my emotions once", he said.
Mr. Gyndon recounted how he had been walking around the community of the Cheternball ride in the hours after the news of the hotel's demise was published, as he sent numerous messages to competitors at the Polo Beach Festival on WhatsApp.
However, the result of his messages was only a gray mark instead of a pair of blue ones.
He said, "I think it meant not sending messages".
Thieves stole $26,750 from a dam in Newport while re-depositing the ETM
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was storing ETMs at a landfill in Newport on Friday morning.
The driver of the motorcycle at the entertainment complex was vacating an ATM and was ready to add more money to it, Diet Denis McCarthy wrote in a newsletter.
While he was at work, another person "run behind the Brink employee" and stole a box of money he was carrying with him for delivery.
According to the news release, eyewitnesses identified several suspects who were fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Individuals with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 3680-292-859.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Yes
Kanye West rappers change his name to Ye
She tweeted on Saturday announcing the name change: "Officially being known as Kanye West".
West, 41, who had been a vocalist for some time, released his eighth album, titled Manicures, in June.
The change came in the wake of her appearance at a live concert Saturday night, which was to be her debut album, Yandee.
The show's creator stated that he would be replacing singer Ariana Cry, who cancelled it due to "emotional reasons".
Besides being the abbreviation of his current artistic name, West said recently that the word also had religious significance for him.
West Draville, speaking to the host of Big Boy Radio this year about the album's title, said, "I think 'you' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you.'"
"Well, I am you, I am us, this is us.
I have changed from a can to just a can to a can to reflect our good, bad, confusion and everything else.
This album is more a reflection of who we are".
He is one of several famous rappers to change his name.
Sen Combs was formerly known as Pop Daddie, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced the names of Lou and Brother Lou as his preferred name.
A former West colleague, Jaye-Zee also measured a choice for himself with a distance line and capital letters.
The Mexican government has pledged not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, pledged never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the military to suppress the people of Mexico".
Military forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people as leftist student movements were forming throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support the opening of more free public universities by providing government grants to Mexican youth who are studying.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving youth into criminal gangs.
The United States must double funding for AI
Kai-Fu-Li, an investor and AI expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that while China is becoming more active in AI, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field.
This was stated after various departments of the US government issued statements on AI, although the US generally lacks an official strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China last year introduced its plan: its goal is to reach the No. 1 position in AI inventions by 2030.
Lee said, "Doubling funding for AI research will be a good start, with great progress expected in AI, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States".
This week, Lee said in an interview with CNBC that doubling funding would double the chances of achieving the next big achievement in AI in the United States.
Lee, whose book "All the Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of SnowShine Venture and has invested in one of China's most popular AI companies, Face++.
He worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s that defeated Atletico, the highest-ranking American player, and later served as Microsoft's chief research officer and head of Google's China agency.
Lee praised the former U.S. government for technological competitions such as the Robotic Challenge of Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency and called for a new round to help identify future concepts.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's pushing scientific leaders away, it's the corporations", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other companies have recruited leading technology experts from universities to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policy will also help the United States to boost efforts on AI.
"I think the green card should be automatically given to people with a PhD in AI", he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its next-generation AI development plan.
Li said that the Chinese Natural Science Foundation, like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that distribute money to U.S. researchers, funds members of academic institutions, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint AI center to bring together partners from factories and scientific institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee on AI.
And last month, DARPA announced $2 million in investment for an initiative called AI Next.
In association with NSF, it currently invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislature, which was setting up a national security commission on artificial intelligence, has not taken action for months.
Some Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on changing the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve decades-long tensions with Greece that had hampered efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that its northern neighbor's name means claim to its territory and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the Arab League.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President George Ivano said he would not vote in the referendum and the campaign for sanctions has led to speculation as to whether the number of voters will meet the minimum 50% criterion for voter credibility.
The question on the polling page was: "Do you want NATO and Europe membership with a deal with Greece?"
Supporters of the renaming, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia's efforts to join the European Union and NATO are also worth paying for, a country that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country and the young people of Macedonia so that they can live independently under the umbrella of the EU because this means a safe life for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijuska of Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they accept the outcome of the vote to be final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority vote in parliament.
The government election commission said there were no irregular reports until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout in the poll was only 16%, compared with 34% in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66% of registered voters voted.
Jose Taniewski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the capital, said: "I'm here to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe".
30 September 2018 in Stromika, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaio, his wife Zurica and son Dusko used their vote in the Macedonian referendum on renaming the country, which will open the way to NATO and EU membership.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardaco was preparing a small stage and setting up the stands in front of the tent that had been installed by the referendum sanctioners.
Kavardaco said, "We are supporters of NATO and the European Union, but we want to be a member with a high profile, not serve through the gate".
"We are a poor country, but we have honor and honor.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other places like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian alliance".
Prime Minister Zaïo said that NATO membership would attract much-needed investment while the unemployment rate is over 20%.
After casting his vote, Zaïo said, "I believe a large majority will be supportive because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supportive of the EU and NATO".
He said a "yes" result would be "the shape of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum below the required number of votes.
The findings of another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57% of respondents decided to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To win the referendum, the number of participants must be 50 plus one percent of the vote.
The defeat in the referendum marks the first major blow to the policy of the West-Fanatic government since the takeover of power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero opens his way to goal for Manchester City from midfield
On Saturday at the Union Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly defended their title and won 0-2 against Manchester City.
In the 65th minute, Aguero made the move easily.
The Argentine goalkeeper earned a pass from the middle of the field at the start of the season.
He competed between three defenders for Brighton before breaking the free field.
And he saw the garment of Agvir, and it was surrounded by four green garments.
He ran for the penalty area corner several times before crossing a defender.
He then passed to Sterling on his left.
The England forward made his first penalty kick to return the ball to Aguero, and he hit the goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right foot towards the right wing.
City manager Pip Guardiola told reporters: "Aguirre is struggling with some of the issues he is facing".
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was our lucky fortune that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Sky the first points in a major league match.
The trick was made in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguero scored the ball for you inside the court.
He led a beautiful pass through the opposing team to Leverot San along the left wing.
Sun did some ball practice before heading to the vertical arrow of the gate.
The forward lineman of the blue skies touched the ball before slipping through the field.
City will play against Mussaf Hafenheim in the Champions League group stage on Saturday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Niker-Platz in Sinesheim, Germany.
Max Schreiser wants to go to the Rockets to hit the target.
While the National Curtain was removed from competition in the final game, there was little reason to have to start again.
But Scherzer, an all-time competitor, hopes to pitch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the final score is still available for the Rockies, who are in the lead of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League West.
On Friday night, the Rockies earned at least one warning card with a 2-5 win over the National Guard, but are still struggling to retain their first-class title.
"While we're not playing for any team, we'll at least be able to create a problem for the final period, knowing that Joe is busy here in Denver and the other team will probably play at the highest point I've seen in my rookie year.
Why wouldn't I compete?"
The National Guard is yet to announce its debut for Sunday, but reports suggest they preferred to allow the sherzer to launch in a similar situation.
Scherzer, who is scheduled to make his 34th start, hit hard on Thursday and will pitch with normal ease on Sunday.
This season, the right-hander from Washington, D.C., is 7-18 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia
While discussing the importance of Republicans' participation in the midterm elections, the President made a brief reference to the situation related to the Supreme Court's nomination of Bert Kavanagh.
"Everything we've done is in the month of November.
We are six weeks away from one of the most important elections of our time.
This is very important and very important. I am not running in elections, I am actually running, which is why I am running for prominent candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, and you see the mess and the ugliness.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they partner with in elections is just for power and control, what they want is power and control, we don't decide to give it to them".
He said Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and deterrence".
"And you've seen it over the past four days", he said, referring to Democrats as "disgusting, contemptible, ugly, and lying".
He was met with a loud voice by the audience, referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee while referring to Senator Danny Finstein, a Democrat.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you uncover the document?
Oh, what.
No, oh no, I'm waiting for one. It was actually the most unspoken language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a party.
This is unbearable to those who express their opinions.
When activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it was amazing.
After all, I was the last person in the line of Labour MPs in Parliament who didn't welcome us.
My fellow parliamentarian John Ryan was treated similarly because he also stood firmly against Judaism.
In my case, my censorship movements were criticized for their opposition to the Carbine Crime.
Crimean mocked former leaders for the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe and similar issues.
A statement on Friday for the East Nottingham Labour Party meeting said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During eight years of service as a member of the local Labour Party in Parliament, the GC's Friday night sessions were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this space is not available at most meetings and the commitment of the policy of "more kind and more honorable" has been forgotten by many and will never be recalled.
It is increasingly apparent that opposing views are not being taken up in the Labour Party and attended to views that are acceptable to the party leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom I previously thought we had similar political views, I was expected to change direction and take a position that I never agreed with  either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly  and it doesn't really matter what we say  their compatriots give incendiary speeches on social media and demand that the tension be de-escalate and the policy be central and tell me not to be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not alone in this experience.
In fact, I am happier than other peers because the opinions about me are more political.
I am amazed at the hard work and determination of my peers who are flooded with sexual and racial abuse every day, but never ashamed.
One of the most frustrating areas of contemporary politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Carbine last week called for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party and that with any "disbelief" move or change in election rules, the party will become more sad.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years, and I've been asked to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much and be "good".
But that's not what I came into politics for.
32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a school student, I was inspired to fight for better service to those who needed it most, either as a local councillor or as a government minister, regardless of the Thatcher government, which had literally caused the decline of my school's comprehensive curriculum.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham was at all confused about the political positions and areas of opposition to the current leadership.
To those who launched the movement on Friday, I would like to tell everyone that while the country is struggling to move towards Brexit, which will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I do not see any interest in devoting my time and energy to loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality, my message is not to my belief in Nottingham, but to my clients, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not. I am proud to serve you and I pledge that no threat to my election or political compromise will stop me from working in areas that I believe will be in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 17 - 38 Milos: Ayr failed unabated
The two recent attempts may have changed the final result in some way, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a win in this amazing and entertaining Tennis Championship of the Day.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the decathlon.
In the end, it was the superior defense that increased the chances that the main wing would do it, and coach Peter Murtzi was right to be happy.
"We were tested in this game, and we're not defeated yet, so I should be happy", he said.
Robin Christy Milross said, "The hope is to return to Ireland, they had a better chance than us".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt was foiled by the overwhelming Claimou, Ayr being the front but a yellow card was given to Scottish captain Rory Hoggs, who had retired for the game by the Warriors, allowing Mirlos to express the numbers and Jason Baggut taking an irreversible attempt.
He pulled out Clymo Ayr, who was suspended for a penalty kick, before the halftime, he scored and then began a slow attempt to score 5-17 at the break for Ayr.
But Mileros got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's effort was thwarted by Baggott, who reduced Levi to five points.
A long break was then announced for the injured Raverid Knott, who had been lying down, and from the start of the re-run the Wave-Ware crossed through the efforts of Stafford McDowell, who was defended by Clymo.
Captain Blair McPherson's supervising officer Ayr was given a yellow card and Milross again faced an unsuccessful attempt by Bruce Colwyn with an extra player at the end of a sudden push-up attack.
However, the main wing returned, and when Captain Hutchinson took the yellow card from the penalty line mark without hitting the ball due to a claymation block, McPherson crashed into the ground with the back of the forward forearm.
Klim began, while he did almost everything from the beginning again, after Kelly had marched on the David Armstrong penalty area and threw out the main line with the effort of Gregory Henry V.
Steel Game is preparing for his new career in the restaurant industry.
It seems that Steel Game star Ford Kieran took up the hospitality profession as the CEO of a licensed restaurant company after it was revealed.
The 56-year-old, who stars and writes in the BBC's popular show Jack Jarvis, starred alongside longtime comedian partner Greg Hempfield.
Both couples announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the final episode of the show, in which Keeran is portrayed as Craigling plotting his life after the series.
According to official lists of historians, he is the director of the Adriftam Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a Scottish Sun source noted that Keernan was seeking to partner in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
"The Sea of Us": Bolivia, stranded on land, hopes to open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors who were sailing with a ship with chains and ropes were centered at La Paz.
And on the roofs of the houses of the people there are blue-green flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are engraved with the motto: "The sea is legally ours".
Getting it back is a challenge".
Across Bolivia, the memory of Chile's loss of a coastline as a result of a bloody 19th-century war still exists.
These aspirations have probably been at their highest levels for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of debate.
A Bolivian diplomat, Roberto Calzadaela, said: "Bolivia has a determination to move, a spirit of unity and determination and naturally expects the outcome with a positive outlook.
Most Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, and hope that the court in The Hague will decide - after decades of irregular negotiations - in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia on the granting of an independent route to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's native and charismatic president, who is running a controversial re-election campaign next year, is also running for a second term on Monday.
He promised in late August that "we are too close to return to the Pacific".
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia  and that doing so will not bring much change.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to pardon the territory of Chile, stating that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
Paz Zarati, an expert on international law in Chile, said the ruling by the International Court of Justice, only six months after the recent arguments were handled, showed that the case was "not complicated".
And despite the progress of Bolivia, the past four years may have pushed it back.
Zarati said, "The issue of access to the sea by the current Bolivian government has been thrown into the dark".
The war proverb Morales has weakened any remaining goodwill Chile has, he said.
Negotiations on some issues in Bolivia and Chile will continue, but after this decision it is very difficult to maintain the discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not had ambassadors to each other.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Wilz, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, denied claims that the court decision process was unusually fast.
He said Monday would bring "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139-year-old disagreements and shared interests" in Bolivia.
Kalazadelia also rejected Morales' claim that he used the sea as a political base.
He added, "Bolivia will never waive its right to access the Pacific Ocean".
"This verdict is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be achieved until it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Lee Yong-ho, said that his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ray was speaking at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the commitments made at the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the brink of a nuclear diplomacy resumption after more than three months of Singapore's clash with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ray said that continuing US sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War would always bring the North to its knees, an "unrealized dream".
Washington is cautious about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking the necessary disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are seeking a second seat.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an armory that the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Show will showcase the latest fashion from the great castles on their way to the nearby main street.
If you want to make your hat collection bigger or completely block the sun, don't wait any longer.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown displayed a row of unusual castles in a hallway for their SS19 collection, which was a stunning feature of Paris Fashion Week among fashion collections.
The most unusual hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have been putting their eye-catching creativity in the corridors.
A ball standing by Valentino had an oversized beige hat with a wide, full-length edge decorated that held the models up.
Other oversized accessories include embellished strawberries, witch hats, and even pineapples - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a collection of amazing masks and only for Halloween use.
Many colorful masks had embroidered lips and were more like Hannibal's lacquer than the design of high fashion clothing.
One of these creations was a water-playing breathing machine with a breathing apparatus and water-playing glasses, while another was a water ice cream cone.
And if you keep up the big fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Light observers predict that flat, peakless castles can reach the highways near you.
Large-sized hats are heated on the heels of the bombs, with a two-foot-wide edge-shaped basket hat on everyone's head from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
The cult tag on the back of the hat, which was highly useless and scattered on social media - introduced another great creativity to the hallway - a beach basket box almost as big as the model swimsuit that covered it.
The burnt orange raffle box, which was cut into pieces with raffle cloth and covered with a white leather strap, was the ball standing at La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a prominent designer, told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the highway for the coming summers - as the designer has made such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for big-size accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and in 2018 it continued with another set of outstanding test results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools strive to provide the best possible level of service to their pupils and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and adapt a custom school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and favorite subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message enters his mind.
If thou speakest with him in his tongue, the word shall come to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of the last year's exams, we see that the languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest scores among independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages earned higher A-scores.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of Mandarin students achieved a higher grade of A, while 72 percent of those who spoke German, 69 percent of those who spoke French, and 63 percent of those who spoke Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now offered as an elective subject, in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) curriculum in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Labour and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers present in trying to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities expected that require language skills, these skills are crucial in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession a person chooses, having a lifelong skill like this, if they have learned a second language, has a real advantage in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically pass a person with multiple language skills through the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 English adults, 75% were not able to speak a foreign language enough to communicate, and only 15% were able to speak French.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for today's children.
Learning multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with a better chance of getting a targeted job.
Within Scotland, the language of instruction at each school will be different.
Some schools will focus on classical languages, while others will teach languages that are more important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese, by 2020.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages offered in independent schools with specialized curricula.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a different educational environment in which they prepare and equip children with the skills they need to succeed and whatever the future requires.
Nowadays, there is no denying the fact that in a global commercial environment, languages are of vital importance for the future of the country, so language must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland.
On Sunday, Lee Brown will host the Lakers' national game for the first time in San Diego.
The wait is almost over and fans are looking forward to seeing Lee Bourne James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' head coach, announced that James will play in the first preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is still unclear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans to split the Lakers' pre-season six-game schedule.
"I don't need to prepare for preseason games at this stage of my career", he said.
Time of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is scheduled to kick off a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump intends to win support in the upcoming midterm elections by voting to approve the person he has chosen to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's meeting tonight in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. eastern time.
You can watch the live broadcast of Trump's West Virginia rally online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to miss a speech at this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanagh, which was tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct by a Senate vote that was expected to be confirmed by a week-long FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this passionate rally is to help Republicans who are affected by the November elections to accelerate it.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign office said the five meetings will be held next week to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majority".
Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters that congressional control was so on his agenda that he would travel to all states if necessary as he entered the campaign season.
According to Metro News of West Virginia, the rally planned for tonight at Wisbincol Square in Wheeling could attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media".
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he had won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help defeat Patrick Morrissey, the Republican Party's Senate nominee in West Virginia with a lower vote.
Cited by Reuters, Simon Heider, a political science scientist at West Virginia University, said, "The fact that the president has to come and raise Morrissey's vote in the election is not a good sign for him".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show their determination to fight to keep their hopes alive for a singles match on Sunday
After three one-way seasons, the four-game Saturday afternoon game may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Fast-moving swing is a completely innovative sporting concept, but players who are really interested in it have never been interested in other competitions like this one.
So where do they say fast-moving is now?
Jordan Spite said as he asked for the race day, "They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I guess I'll just stir it up a little bit".
Europe has this point, of course, four points ahead with twelve games remaining.
As Spite says, Americans feel that they have the wind on their windships and they have the precision and they should be encouraged a lot, at least Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, each with three points out of four.
Spite's progress from goal to field is excellent and is a model for the forward.
As soon as his turn came, the cries of the horns rose, and while he and Thomas were two points short, they scored four more points by throwing the ball into the hole.
The other pitch, which scored 15 points, was greeted with similar shouts, suggesting that he believed the American team was not out of it.
"You really have to hit the target and be concerned about your game", Spite said.
Only all these players are left now.
18 holes to create a mark.
The only players to score more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are the winners of the Ryder Cup.
The pair is unique but commendable in Europe, with four out of four and they can't make any mistakes.
Mollywood were the only pair to not throw an over-the-top hit on Saturday afternoon, but they also refrained from hitting on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not back on Friday morning.
The performance and manner in which the crowds were apparently consuming their energy motivated the players to win on Sunday, and as the sun set over the National Golf League, there was no other influential player than Fleetwood and Molinari to score a potential victory for Europe.
Preferably both were located on different holes at the same time.
However, the talk of the glory and grandeur of Europe is still premature.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson ended the efforts of Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball champion, by joining forces with Alex Noren.
A single and two double strokes against the nine-man squad entered the spainard and swede holes and they never climbed.
And on the first day of the week, there is no one to help you out of the pit.
Due to interaction between the two players, advice they gave and advice they did not give, and the way a strategy can instantly change, watching players from four-toed and four-toed teams is very misleading.
Europe has played better as a team so far, achieving a significant advance to the quarterfinals, but this four-man season also showed that the U.S. team is determined to fight against that number, especially as the Americans themselves were skeptical.
Europe won the Ryder Cup final by a margin of 10-6
Europe successfully advanced to the Ryder Cup final after leading 6-10 against the United States in the four-man and four-man events.
Motivated duo Tommy Flight and Francesco Molinari were thrilled to hold their lead in the Leigh Golf National to four points with a victory over the forward Tiger Woods.
Thomas Beaverne of the European side, trying to retain their prize, which they had lost two years earlier in Hazleland, prevailed over the defeated American side in the morning quarter-final, drawing a 1-3 series.
The United States showed more resistance in the four-man period, winning two races but failing to break the score.
Jim Forke's team needed 8 points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain their prize.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who both call themselves "Mollywood" combined, are only the second pair to score four points since the start of their four races in Ryder history, after an exciting weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patek Reed in the Quartet, they went super-hard to beat the undefeated Woods and freshman American Bryson DeCambeau with a more emphatic 4&5.
Woods, who tied his game with two games on Saturday, was particularly bright in the event, but he lost 19 of his 29 games in the four-and-a-half and seven games in a row.
Justin Day, while resting for the morning foursome, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeating his friends Johnson and Brooks Coppa in a 1&2 tie - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe was not at all on a pleasant, busy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spitze and Justin Thomas, who won the big three, set the American record for the most points scored on Saturday with two.
They won the Fourth Round by 2&1 over John O'Reilly and Ian Poller, and later returned to defeat Pauller and Rory McCullough by losing the first two holes and scoring 3&4 in a four-game series.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did a team from a four-point deficit return to singles, although as a keeper, the Hurricane team needed only a draw to retain the award.
However, after two days in the top two, it looks like Sunday's counter-attack will be beyond them.
North Korea says there is no "no way" to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would create distrust of the country and that it could not unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong-ho told the annual summit of the World Assembly that North Korea had carried out "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, eliminating nuclear testing sites and committing not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the United States", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States of America, there is no assurance of our national security and in such a situation it is not possible to first of all unilaterally disarm".
While Ray repeated the complaints of North Korea's familiarity about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament and the gradual steps it would take in this area, in return for which North Korea would be rewarded, his comments on the concept were important because he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first withdraw its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first nuclear disarmament' and increases the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal in a compulsory manner, even protesting the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" said Ray.
"The realization that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an unrealistic dream for people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions will increase our distrust".
Ray did not mention any plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, the minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding, "If the opposing party to the disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the destruction of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so complete".
However, the tone of Ray's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was unwise and then "Mr. Chairman" Trump called President Kim a "missile man" for a suicide mission.
Trump praised Kim for his courage in disarmament efforts, saying that much still needs to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea is nuclear-death-stricken.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue with seriousness and without failure until we see a complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in a unanimous vote to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit, after which he said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in June, saying that within hours progress had been made only for North Korea, which condemned him for having "similar requests from the insurgents".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month that if the United States takes "appropriate measures", it will destroy the missile site as well as a nuclear complex.
He said Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were Trump's promised security guarantees in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year will encourage all students who sleep more to study coffee at night in an effort to combat the growing culture of studying.
The findings of an academic show that the world's number one university students are often indifferent to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Sisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
Finally, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I being told these things now that I'm a freshman?"
She told the Telegraph that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me.
The course, which was first offered this year, explains the requirements for how good sleep habits help students in academic and athletic performance as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said: "The university decided to introduce this course after it was discovered that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive workshops.
In one section, there is a picture of a lily room where students click on coffee tables, curtains, tutors and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects exercise performance, and the importance of daily sleep time for them.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive symbols, then encourages participants to think about their daily affairs.
"We know that this behavior of students will not change immediately.
Professor Chechler added: "We believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to be informed about the health effects of smoking".
He said that the culture of pride in "killing the night owls" still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students who are sleep deprived is a growing problem.
He said ensuring adequate and good quality sleep should be a "hidden weapon" for students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even leading to weight loss, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Sisler design the course because he had one of his classes with him last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
She said the course opened her eyes and inspired her to pursue a university-level course.
He expressed hope that the next stage would require all postgraduate students to complete a similar curriculum before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Zissler advised students to set the alarm to go to bed and wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" exposed by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your daytime nighttime rhythm and lead to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goal Minga defeated Gerard's players
While a Dally Menga side-scorched kick defeated Steven Gerrard 0-1 at Livingston, Rangers faced another gruesome match.
After a 1-4 February win at St Johnstone, the Abrocks were looking to record their first win, but the Grey Holt team only managed to score a second defeat to Gerard in 18 games as manager to give the Leaders Heart eight points to win the Ladbrokes title.
Minga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' unmotivated lineup was unbalanced.
While Rangers are now relegated to the sixth tier, Livingston are relegated to the third tier by goal difference and only behind Hibernian.
After an object was apparently thrown from a distance and hit the goalkeeper Callum Spence, he had to be treated, and there may have been problems with the Rangers' armour.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, eliminating former Ayr in the semi-final stage of the Bitfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same 11th league that scored a single Hertz last week and will be pleased with the way he performed well, preventing his opponents from being grouped in each round.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston made more of an effort with the ball in their possession.
They were to score within two minutes of the first Minga hit by Scott Pittman to the goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder struggled with a good chance.
The free kick from Keegan Jacobs went to captain Craig Halcott, but his defensive partner, Allen Litgo, returned it only behind the penalty area from a good angle.
Rangers gained their dominance but seemed more hopeful than sure of their third-place finish.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that a penalty should be announced at the penalty area at a quarter because he and Steven Lawalde had collided, but judge Steven Thompson rejected the petitions.
Rangers blocked only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly struggled with a Lasanna Coley-Bally attack by O'Azaria.
While Levy's 34th-minute forward may be against the flow of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it just because of their connection.
Again, the Rangers could not resist the deep blow of Jacobs.
While Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson and held back until Minga simply threw the ball to the goal, Scott Orfield did not respond.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent with a Collibaly in the interim, and this change had an almost immediate effect, as the striker struck Morelos but an amazing Kelly hit the ball from his own line to prevent it.
But Livingston continued to draw the audience's attention to the kind of play they enjoyed, as Lithgow and Halcock threw the ball at long distances.
Holt's team was able to improve on their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up to stop Jacobs before Litgaugh came out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton replaced Rangers with another temporary penalty claim because he had collided with Jacobs but again ignored Thompson.
Germanak: inventor of the Geiger calculator
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the use of the well-known Geiger calculator.
Since its emergence as a major branch of science, the Geiger census has become a powerful and still major culture, as in the 1950 film The Wars of the Coronado, starring those who were apparently less likely to be Gautchen scientists like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
And he said, What is this?
Rogers: "It is a Geiger calculator used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on this headset, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that have been turned off by radiation on minerals".
Evans: "Tell me, it's definitely ticking now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" stem cells
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" and kill stem cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify stem cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can "see" and re-inject the common protein in many cancers.
Trial vaccines in patients with a wide range of cancers have shown promising results.
A woman undergoing treatment with a vaccine, which trains the immune system to identify suppressed cells, saw that her ovarian cancer had been gone for more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the lab to see a common protein of many cancers called HER2, and then re-creating the cells.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Berzowski, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzowski explained: HER2 "comprises several types of cancer in adults", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "training" how to target cancer cells is found in the treatment of a type of worker's blood cancer.
Kanye West began to criticize Trump's supporters sharply and indelibly after appearing at a live concert Saturday night wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was under the hood in the studio after a lively performance during a live concert Saturday night in which he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would run for president in 2020.
She reiterated her support for Trump in a protest against Democrats after performing her third song that night, Ghost Town, in which we return glory to America.
"I talk to a white person a few times and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
The Saturday night live concert began the show with a performance of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Burt Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment charges allegedly brought by Christine Bally Ford.
Although not broadcast, images of West's iconic video were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule the West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that he had been having difficult moments behind the scenes about his hat.
"They were bullying me behind the scenes.
And they said to him, Go not into the city with that hat.
They raped me!
Based on the Washington Examiner report, he said: "And then they said I was in a drowning place".
"Do you want to see the drowned place?" continued West, saying that he would "build Superman, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world moving forward?
Try love".
Variety reported that despite his remarks leading to audiences turning booze at least twice, and the cast members of Saturday night's live concert appeared embarrassed, another person who was there told the publication, "The whole studio was silent".
West was introduced as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend rapper Juan McMiller died a few days ago.
West impressed many with his performance of I Love it, and dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West supported the TPUSA leader, Candice Turner, with a tweet: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you for standing up for MOB".
But Karen Hunter, a television interviewer, tweeted that Wist was simply "completely amazing how she is a person".
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art'), but someone who I believe has an idea and gives it a boost that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
He added that we are".
Before the performance, rapper Juan announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially being known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and Pi DiDi.
His rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Line and of course Prince B'B'Erin, changed his name to a symbol and eventually became known as Prince.
Attempted murder charges for stabbing a man with a knife in your restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident occurred in Balihkamur.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast local court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kate Harrington, star of the Crown and the toxic masculinity of the game, was heavily criticized.
Kate Harrington is best known for playing the sword woman John Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has faced the stereotype of a male hero, saying that such roles on television mean young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kate, speaking to Sunday Times Colcher, said she believed "something went wrong" and asked about how to solve the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kate, who recently married her co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that she feels "completely serious" about addressing the issue.
"I personally feel quite serious", she said, "what is wrong with being a man?"
And they said, What have we taught men in this day?
Kate believes television is partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity due to her male personalities.
He continued: 'What is inherent and what is acquisitive?
Does what is taught on TV and on the streets make young boys feel that they need to be a man in this particular aspect?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For the young men have been made to see the error of their ways.
He also admitted in an interview that after the end of the series Game of Thrones next summer, he will not be playing in any previous and subsequent installments, adding that his work with the battlefields and spins is over.
As of November, Kate will star in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a baggy bear.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, is the best thing he's ever done in the game of thrones.
"I met my wife in this show", he said, "and so that family gave me my future and my life".
Day played Yegrit, Kate's favorite mistress, John Snow, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.
The couple married on Lizzie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% surge in its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse, and this is a sign of a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spreads rapidly in some areas of China due to the transmission of infected blood.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Greek state that the number of people infected with HIV by this method had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people annually.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese diaspora.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against transgender people is said to be high.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the disease outbreaks are due to inadequate sexual care in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed global access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the issue.
Maxine Waters disclosed information to GOP senators that was denied by one of her employees and was criticized for "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied the allegations on Saturday that three U.S. Republican senators had published personal information on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages by one of her employees.
The Los Angeles Democrat stressed that the claims were circulated by experts and "extreme right" websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter: "Lies, lies and lies are more hateful".
The information released included home addresses and phone numbers of senators such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Erwin Hatch, both from Utah, USA.
The information was published online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate court hearing over allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanagh.
The revelation came moments after the interrogation of three senators from Kavanagh.
Hill said conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the mail was linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of Waters' staff.
Waters continued: "This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised by these false and misleading claims - were not at all responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This is a lie, and a lie.
Waters' remarks quickly drew criticism, including former White House press spokesman, Ari Fletcher.
"This denial is anger-induced", wrote Fletcher.
He said: "It shows that he does not believe he is a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has done, he should not be angry.
They should not hate.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They must be quiet and quiet".
Apparently, Fletcher was trying to compare Water's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry at a hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, the Republican candidate who is running for Waterhouse in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Big if it's true", she tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that his office had "warned law enforcement agencies and authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, and that they are legally held accountable for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to my staff members", he continued.
Johnny English Strikes Re-examined - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spoof spyof
Recognizing the importance of Brexit in any new film is now a tradition with a British attitude that seems to be reviving the activity of the Johnny English comedy film industry, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived gradually again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-deprecating satire about how obviously we're fucked up be the country's new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, wide-eyed, rubbery-faced, inadequate, has been licensed to refurbish ruined things for the second time - his name is a symbol above all else that he is a great innovator of humour for the landscape of English-language cinema.
He is a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre appearances, had a slightly claustrophobic tongue-cheek, passion and taste, and a doll that he helped with a single note as the song Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He also originally starred in the television commercial Forgotten Barclaycard, based on the traveller and mysterious international man Atkinson, which was a mess.
There are a few beautiful moments on Johnny English's last fun trip.
I fell in love with the moment Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing medieval armor and the helicopter's wheel blades moving slowly in front of his hat with his head in a veil.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the overall good nature is presented with insufficient force and is strangely unnecessary, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves can now confidently form comedy as a single material.
The joke feels that children are more targeted than adults, and I don't think Johnny English's distracting exploits are as tempting as the silent film Luddie Atinson's in the character of Ben, creative and focused.
The ongoing debate is that Great Britain is now facing a serious problem.
A cyber thief has infiltrated the UK's ultra-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents involved, and has made the officer afraid of the task, with little regret for Quinn Aldon.
This is the last thing worthless for a prime minister who has a shiny, confused face and is now in a complete disintegration of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this terrifyingly-like character but there isn't much to do in the script.
His intelligence advisers inform him that if any active spy is exposed, he will have to retire a person.
And that means Johnny English, the disorderly, himself now works as a school principal at some institutions, but he's doing an unprecedented lesson on how to do a secret thing: some good stuff here, as English offers a school with a rock-academic spy nature.
English returned to White Hall to provide urgent information and played with former long-suffering partner Beau Miller again.
Bao is now a married man and has served as an enlisted submarine commander, playing a cheerful wooden and hockey stick in which Wiki Pepperin has lost some of his game.
Thus, Batman and Robin return to the stage by mistaking Her Majesty's Secret Service, and face off against Ophelia Boltowa, the beautiful face of Ogla Korlenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling under the spell of charismatic tech billionaires who claim to solve UK computer problems: Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Baou begin their epic poem with the high-pitched clown-like quest: they make themselves up as waitresses and set fire to a French restaurant; they get drunk and smuggle their own luxury windshield Volvo; and English creates chaos when he tries to use the headset of virtual reality to familiarize himself with the inside of the Volvo.
Of course, all stops are planned for the last scene, but as lovely and exciting as it is, there is everything about children's TV.
You're a very average shit.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: Could the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role and actually do justice to this talent?
Labour rejected the plan to allow Britons to work four days a week and receive five days' wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week - but receive five days' wages.
According to reports, the party wants the company's employers to pass on the benefits of the AI revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
This allows employees to enjoy a three-day weekend vacation - but still return home with the same salary.
Sources said the concept is in line with the party's economic agenda and intends to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way to leverage a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year".
"This does not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a dream that is consistent with the Party's approach to returning the economy financially to the benefit of workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party".
The Labour Party will not be the first party to endorse such an idea, although the Green Party has committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election.
However, this idea has not yet been generally endorsed by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not party politics and is not considered a party issue".
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to raise his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless" and "sweetheart" executives in the financial sector.
Shadow Prime Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all their shares, as the Labour government can make "reductions" for perceived reasons of violation.
He also stated that he intends to appoint employees to the board of directors of companies and to create a comprehensive ownership fund to transfer 10% of shares of private sector companies to employees, who must have an annual share capital of at least £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, told 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanagh could change their mind.
The FBI investigation into charges against Justice Bert Kavanagh delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court candidacy by at least a week, raising the question of whether the office's findings could lead any Republican senators to withdraw their support for him.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, Scott Polley, reporter for 60 Minutes, asked Republicans whether the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy of South Carolina appeared more open to his colleague.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course".
"I said I spoke to Kavanaugh Judge when I went to the hearing.
And I called him after this had happened, and the charge came forth, and he said, Didst thou do this?
He was determined, determined, clear-cut".
However, Graham's vote appears to be unchanged.
"My mind is full of the matter of Burt Kavanagh and it will be a risky accusation", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Graham denied it, "adding, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all that call upon him cannot confirm it.
She is 36 years old.
I'm not seeing anything change".
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that features a very impressive lineup of performing stars and has an equally impressive mission; ending global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people marching to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B. and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual purpose of the festival to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which was announced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the concert (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a series of activities, or "events" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about its goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to encourage people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or by posting a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million "feet" of fans and wants to pursue different goals.
The report said that these measures have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and notices resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funding has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include nutrition power, the participation of UK-based investors and executives who have pledged to "help children grow to their full potential", and have pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
In April 2018, Ambassador to the Food Power, Tracy Olman, speaking to a crowd during a live concert in London, said, "With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens just like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a historic milestone".
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the UK government announced a project funded by the name of "Nutritional Power" that will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
She responded to a common question on her website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Muncie are among some of the performers performing at this year's ceremony in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferns and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy to "sea blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports.
Citing Washington Egzminer, Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of the Interior, revealed that Washington could "recourse to its navy if necessary" to prevent Russia from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zink claimed that the Russian conflict in Syria - in particular, where it operates legitimately at the government's invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is due to their energy-dependent nature, as they do in Eastern Europe, they also operate in the southern European continent", he said.
And, according to the formalities, there are ways and means to combat it.
He said, "The United States has the capacity to ensure that our naval forces, along with our Navy, are open and, if necessary, blockade it until their energy is delivered to the market".
Zinc addressed the participants at a rally hosted by the Consumer Energy Union, a nonprofit group that considers itself the "centre of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's efforts in dealing with Russia and Iran, adding that these efforts are effectively similar.
The economic option for Iran and Russia, more or less, has influential effects and is a fuel substitute, he said, referring to Russia as a "horseshoe" and adding that its economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as the Trump administration, by surveying Russia, worked on its mission to raise the level of its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and provide cheaper options for European consumers.
Thus, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to encourage Germany to withdraw from the project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, has led to the Berlin Uprising by Russia.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $2.11 billion Nord Stream pipeline, which is set to increase the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a fully economic project.
The Kremlin stresses that Washington's bloody stance against the project is only stable for economic reasons, and that this is an example of unhealthy competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September: "I believe we have a common view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers".
The U.S. intervention has prompted a serious reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German pioneering foundation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has addressed the United States to refrain from European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between Angela Merkel, German Prime Minister, and Vladimir Putin, Russian President: "I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a session at the Sharwaali salon in Holyoke, Senator Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
According to Hill, he said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and build a broken government and that's only possible if the leadership is by a woman".
"I will be thinking about running for president after November 6th".
Pressuring President Donald Trump, he said during a meeting at the Sharwaali salon that "it's driving this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm as concerned as my bones are about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Donald Trump and Bryant Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
The poll, which was not released on Thursday, showed that the majority of voters did not think that Gan Warin should run in the 2020 election.
According to a global survey by Suffolk University/Boston Center for Political Research, fifty-eight percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not participate.
Thirty-two percent supported this participation.
The poll showed more support for the participation of Diol Patrick, the previous governor, with the remaining 38% supporting potential participation and 48% opposing it.
Other high-ranking Democratic names discussed in connection with candidacy in the 2020 election included Joe Biden, former Vice President, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision in January.
Sarah Palin is referring to PTSD in the Donald Trump March.
Turk Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq before he applied in September.
He was arrested and convicted of domestic violence on Monday night.
Addressing a crowd on the way to Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, she said, "No matter what happens to my son, no matter what happens to him when he comes back, I understand the families who are experiencing PTSD and the trauma that our soldiers are coming back with".
Pauline called his arrest "the elephant in the room", saying that his son and other soldiers "went back a little different but stronger, they came back feeling that there was respect for what the soldiers and air force and every member of the military have given to this country".
According to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Walissa Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and convicted of assault and domestic abuse of a woman, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to the new asylum policy
The states and the District of Columbia are facing legal challenges to the new U.S. policy of denial of asylum for victims of domestic violence or crime.
NBC News filed a brief appeal Friday in Washington, representing 18 states and districts, in support of a policy challenging refugees.
The court's complaint claims that the American Civil Liberties Union, which fought against the federal Fair Housing policy in August, has not yet been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys who are members of their violent gang" harassed her but that U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application until July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries with the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States because of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who had fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
General Carl Russin, the District of Columbia's governor, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The appeal summarizes the court's "federal law requires that all asylum applications based on facts and circumstances be adjudicated, and such prohibitions violate this principle".
The lawyers stressed in the summary that the policy of prohibiting immigrants from entering the U.S. economy was detrimental, adding that they may be conducting business and "providing the necessary wages".
The General Staff Meeting of the Sarsnaval in June ruled that immigration judges should not give more asylum to those fleeing domestic persecution and gang violence.
During the sessions during his policy announcement, on June 11, he stated that "asylum is available to those who have left their country due to fear of death, based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social or political group".
Asylum has never been a way to reduce all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face in their daily lives.
Rescue efforts in Palo Alto have doubled as the number of dead has been increased in search of survivors.
The situation for survivors was increasingly dire.
"It's a sad feeling", said Reza Kasma, a 35-year-old mother who was relieving her infant son of a fever at an evacuation center in the suburban city of Palo Alto.
"Every moment an ambulance brought the bodies here.
There is little water to drink".
And they saw the inhabitants of the land, and they returned to their houses, and they drew their cattle out of the water, and they sought to save them, as much as they could.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were filled with injured by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including two Harris with broken back and shoulder bones, were lying outside the Palo military hospital, where patients were being treated for severe and persistent earthquakes.
When he felt the tremor of the earthquake that rocked the fifth room of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter, tears filled his eyes.
"It was not the time to save our lives.
Harris told Associated Press, "I think I was stuck between the ruins of the walls", adding that her family had gone to town to attend a wedding.
"I heard a woman crying for help, but then I heard a silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
The US ambassador accuses China of mocking the advertising campaign
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US newspaper to promote mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies, pointed to a Chinese newspaper that paid supplementary costs to the state's best-selling newspaper, Des Moines Register.
Trump's accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the US election showed what US officials told Reuters was a new step toward Washington's intensification of the campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish their announcements in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that has seen tariffs on each other's imports be lifted.
Chinese and American experts said that retaliatory tariffs were imposed by China early in the war to target exporters of rice in the states of Hamshu-Lwa, which were backed by the Republican Party of China.
Terry Bernstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Liwa, China's largest exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and businesses.
Brunsett wrote in a commentary in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China now doubles these ridicule by launching propaganda ads, in our own free media".
Brunsett wrote, "By dismantling its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and our free media, by publishing advertisements in Des Moines Register Sue",
He wrote, "On the contrary, in the lower newsroom of Vork here in Beijing, you will see limited voices of opposition and no real reflection of the various views that the Chinese people may have about the path of economic engagement, that the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China".
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers was a minority in the publication of his article", although he did not name the paper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating female voters before midterm elections with the disgrace of the Kwanzaa.
While a large number of Republicans defend the position of Brett Kavanaugh, the court's top candidate, against a large number of sexual harassment allegations, analysts have warned that they will face a serious response, particularly from women, in the upcoming or long-term elections.
The level of sentiment was high, and a large number of Republicans on the list indicated that they wanted to go ahead with the vote.
Grant Richer, a law professor at the McNeeseville School of Law at Syracuse University-Hill, said in an article that appeared on Saturday, "There can be no withdrawal on this type of issue".
Richer said he doubted Senate last-minute efforts by Jeff Felix to believe that the FBI investigation was sufficient to calm voter anger.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karen Jean-Perry, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive movement MovOn, said Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November".
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee they elected to run for the Kwano presidency, which, according to Mays, Dr. Christine Bissley Ford testified to.
Stu Rodinberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site, "Democratic passion and interest will be out of bounds".
"It is true what they say, 'He has already reached the heights.'
But it can be higher, especially among women voters in cities and young voters, 18-29 years old who don't like the president, don't usually vote".
Even before Ford gave public testimony on the details of sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts recommended that reactions might be possible if Republicans tried to confirm him.
According to NBC News, Michelle Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, "This has caused a great deal of confusion for the GOP".
Guy Sinclair, director of United States Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told CNN: "It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's about the way the Republicans have handled him".
However, Americans seem to believe in a group that, in part, believes in Ford and his testimony against the Kawanawa, with little inclination towards the Kawanawa.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believed in the Ford testimony either absolutely or probably, while 35% said they definitely or happily believed in Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 Feds said they thought Quana may have lied or Judge may have lied during the testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following an effort by Flake, the FBI has already begun its investigation into allegations made by Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford swore last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had molested her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez is accused of showing her genital organs to a candidate while attending a party while studying at Yale in 1980.
The discovery of the global internet is planning to launch a new internet to catch up with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berner-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, takes his first steps towards competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech giant, Inrupt Company, is building the open source platform Solid Burner.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that his destination behind Inrupt was "rule the world".
He said of his first steps, "We must implement this now".
"This is a historic moment".
The toolkit uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online database" or POD.
The store includes lists, to-do lists, art, music, library and other personal and professional items.
It is available in the form of a hard drive, Microsoft Outlook, Silk, and Spotify, all in one browser and simultaneously.
What is special about an online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can and what kind of access to the information.
The company called it "personal empowerment through information".
The Inrupt theory, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to pool resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now owns Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform provided by IBM, a number of contracted employees who are hired to work on the project and a volunteer recruiting committee.
Starting this week, tech developers from around the world will be able to create their own decentralized widgets, using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team "don't talk about whether Facebook and Google will make a big change, where other business models have been completely created in the blink of an eye".
"We do not ask permission".
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to contribute to the coherence and quality of the new web created at Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee formed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
During the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in neutral conversations.
Even at the time of Inrupt's opening, Berners-Lee will remain open as founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Information Institute.
Berners-Lee added, "I am incredibly optimistic about the new age of the Web".
Bernard Van: The Spirituality of the Victoria Cross of WW1 came into being
The award of the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrated 100 years ago in his hometown by the only Church of England priest, a fighter.
The second Colonel, the Hon. Bernard Van, took the award on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Billings and Leacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never realizing that he had made the greatest military honor of his time.
A monument was unveiled on the side of two of his necks on Saturday, at the actual performance of the Nordmuthshire.
One of his novices, Michelle Van, said that it was "a brilliantly symbolic form" and that the stone should have been displayed exactly 100 years ago, on the day he received the award from his parents.
According to the London Magazine, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van II crossed his army through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a thick mudflat and under heavy shelling of the series".
He then went to the line of fire and advanced the line "with great courage" before taking the gun in one hand and striking the three sides.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michelle Van, 72, said her father's actions were "something I could never do, but it's a humble thing".
He and his brother Dr. James Van also presented a bouquet after the performance, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michelle Van said she was "very proud of the show except for this one", adding that "the virtue of a real hero is shown with the support of a lot of people".
MMA signers stayed up all night to see the 206 Beirut, but instead they saw the Pepa Pig.
Imagine you waited all night to see Bill 206, only to be banned from seeing the main program.
The St. Youse Bill included 13 battles, including six battles in the main card, which was to be broadcast overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gigard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet each other, British viewers were shocked when the live broadcast turned into a Peppa Pig.
And there were men of the visionary class who were not pleased; for they watched the battle all night long, until the first hour of the day.
One fan on Twitter called the live-action adaptation of the children's cartoon "an unpleasant joke".
When asked about the transfer, Def Squartz, senior vice president of monitoring and communications at Belarus, said, "It is a government regulation that the content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to broadcast the children's program".
""Pippa the Pig", yes.
Scott Cocker, president of the company, Bellatour, said they were going to work on a timeshare to keep the UK's visionary in the future.
"I think when I think about the answer, I think we might solve it", said Cocker.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this change came about, I saw a lot of messages going up and down, and all of them weren't very friendly.
We were trying to solve this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's problem.
I can promise you that this will not happen in the future.
We're going to reduce the number of matches from six to five - as usual - and we're trying to show more matches to the fans, so the number of matches is increasing.
This is a sad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly feels 'furmy' about sex
Olympic dancer Tom Daly says that he grew up with a sense of humility toward everyone because of his gender - but that encouraged him to make a success of it.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize that "everyone is not like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking to Radio 4 Desert Island, hosted by Lauren Leverney, she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a father made him think less about winning an Olympic medal.
Christie Young, the daily runner of the long-term programme, took several months off due to illness.
While appearing as a solo act on the first show, Deeley said she felt "less like others" growing up because "it was not acceptable in society that she loved both boys and girls".
"To this day, it's the feeling of being inferior and feeling different from real things that has empowered me to succeed", she said.
She said she wanted to prove she was "something" until everyone knew about her sexual orientation and didn't let her down.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist was one of the biggest LGBT promoters and used her appearance at Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge other countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
She said she spoke about it because she felt happy living without distractions and wanted to give others "hope".
She, a three-time world champion, said she fell in love with a man - American filmmaker, Lillian Black, whom she met in 2013 - "hit me by surprise".
Daly married an Oscar winner 20 years older than her, but she said the difference in life was never a problem.
She spoke of her first Olympics when she was 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - "when you have a lot of problems in a short life", she said, saying it was difficult for her to find someone whose experiences at the heights and stages of life were similar to her.
The couple had a son named Robert Roy Black-Deley in June, and Deley said he had "changed his whole outlook".
"If you asked me last year", he said, "I would have said that I won the gold medal".
"You know, there are bigger things in life than gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby".
His son's name is the same as his father's, who died at age 40, in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said her father would not accept that she would die, and one of the last things she asked him was to buy her tickets to London 2012 - because she wanted to sit on the first train.
And he said, I could not tell him that thou shalt not live, till thou sitest in the first train, my father.
"I held her hand tight when she breathed and kept doing it, and when she stopped breathing, I finally knew she wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year Delhi participated in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was something I'd dreamed of all my life, dreaming of diving in front of people at the Olympics, it didn't feel better", she said.
This fact was also the motivation for his first song - Proudly on the Little Straw Jarub - which was a tonic for preparing for the Olympics with him and still had his body hair.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11:15 BST.
Mickelson sat out of the light on Saturday in the Reader's Cup chair.
American Phil Mickelson will be closing Rickard on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to reverse his style to avoid an unpredictable outcome.
Mickelson, who is playing the tournament, which is held every two years, for the 12th time, was shown to a chair by captain Jim Forke for his four balls multiple times on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as he usually did for the USA, the winner of five major tournaments spent half his days as a cheerleader and the other half of his day working on his game hoping for what he could do to help.
A man who has never been a regular rider, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old man has never been a good choice for the rigorous course of Leigh National Golf, where long-term hardship pays off unpleasantly every day.
And of course, the course itself is not as scary, with Mickelson entering his ninth race on Sunday, facing outright British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who has signed with Tommy Fleetwood to win four races this week.
If the Americans, with four points less than the 12 singles starts, enter and make a warm-up start, the Mickelson race could prove to be a real emergency.
Ferrick expressed confidence in her husband, not as much as she could say.
Fergie said, "He knew exactly what he was doing today, so he put his hand on my shoulder, put his arm off my neck and said, 'He'll be ready tomorrow.'
"She has a lot of confidence in herself.
He is famous and has been very disappointed with these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't picture him playing a game of chess.
I expected more from him, but that's what happened, and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there like everyone else".
Mickelson will beat Rickard Nick Faldo for the most games played on Sunday.
This could be the end of his career in the Reader's Cup, which has never been equalled by his highest solo record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-to-half losses, although Ferrick said his presence had led to intangible gains for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny and funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy to have on the team", she explained.
"I think the young players have had a good time going up there, which is interesting to see.
She has given more than just playing, she has given more than just playing".
Thomas Jorn, the European captain knows that great leadership could soon disappear.
Thomas Bajorne, European captain, knows from his experience that a measured lead towards the final day of singles races in the Ryder Cup can easily lead to an unpleasant turn.
Dean made his debut in 1997 at Voldemort, where he was captained by Sioux Basterious, who scored five points against the Americans but won the final with the lowest margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
Bajorne said when he was photographed after winning the 2018 class 3-5 on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a 6-10 trip to Lee Gulf National, "You remind yourself that we were at the top of the podium; we were at the top of the podium in Brooklyn where we stayed and we won, that's all".
So history showed me and everyone on this team that it was not over.
You will be born again tomorrow.
Go there, and do all that is good.
It will not end until you have received your score.
We have one goal and that is to try to win this award for ourselves, and that's what we should be focused on.
I've always said, I'm focused on the 12 players who play for us, but we still know who's on our side - the best players in the world".
While rejoicing that his players were playing hard on the golf course, Bjorn added: "I never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow is a solo show that's okay and something different.
It's great to be there with a partner who's doing well, but when you're alone, you're tested for your full potential as a golfer.
This is the message you should share with your players, show your best tomorrow.
Now leave your partner alone, and he must go and show his best".
In contrast to the Jorn, Jim Ferrick, who had the opposite number, would have asked his players to shine better individually than they did playing with a partner, with Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas being more expected to score three points, including four.
Ferreki himself worked hard at the end of the last two days with a drastic change, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing one as Europe pulled out of the "Miracle in Medina".
He said in response to a question about how the captain relied on his players in 1999 to reach the final day, "I remember every damn word of it".
"We have 12 big matches tomorrow, but we want to get off to a fast start, like you did in Brooklyn, or like you did in Medina.
When the stage moves in a direction, there is a lot of pressure on middle races.
We're going to set our lines up the way we want to put the players, you know, we're going to try to do a little magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight against each other and will face Rory McClory in the higher race, and Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Rohm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poller in the lower half.
Regarding the selections for the singles, Jørgen said, "I chose this group of men this way because I think it covers the whole route".
The German warship was once again postponed.
Local media reported that the newest German naval base was due to start operations in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warship, but the ship will not be operational until next year due to problems with the system and use of snowballs.
According to the newspaper Dai Zit, the launch of the newly launched Rhineland-Palatinate-class vessel Badin-Wittemberg-Class has been postponed until the second half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but post-transfer problems have caused the future of the large project to change.
The four-ship Baden-Wittemberg-class was ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the old Baden-class.
They are known to feature powerful balls, a combination of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as a number of covert technologies such as radar, red flags and reduced sound signals.
Other important facilities include long maintenance periods - it should be possible to send the latest ships away from domestic ports, for two-year missions.
Day Zeit notes, however, that sustained delays would mean that the fleet of warships that would allow Germany to plan its foreign missions would be outdated by the time it entered service.
The unsuccessful F125 warship was among the titles last year, when the German Navy officially banned the ship from service and turned it over to the Belheim & Wuss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship had been returned to the shipbuilder after the ship had been transferred.
There is not enough information available on the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media have pointed to a number of "software and hardware problems" that would have rendered the ship useless if sent for a war mission.
The software inadequacy was particularly important as the Baden-Waterburg-class ships would be led by a group of 120 soldiers - only half a manpower that operated on the previous Bremen warship.
Also, it turned out that the ship was significantly overweight, which would reduce activity and limit the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palace ship will be transported while carrying twice the weight of the same ship used by Germany during World War II.
Despite the inadequate hardware, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - was problematic.
It is said to be worth €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - €2.2 billion more than expected.
The problems on the latest warship are particularly important in light of recent threats of shrinking German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was "facing very few ships with the capacity to go on a mission".
The official said the problem had grown larger over time as older ships were no longer in operation but no other vessel was built to replace them.
He explained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class battleships were capable of joining the Navy.
The National Trust has listened to the mysterious life of bats
New research has been started at a Scottish Highlands centre to find out how bats use landscapes to hunt their food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behavior of rare flying mammals and help pave the way for the interactive activities of these creatures.
The research, funded by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will track normal bats and supernote piperlies, as well as brown-footed bats and dublinton bats in the Inverire Gardens of Westerday.
Special recorders will be moved to key locations in the park to record activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also try to launch mobile surveys using handheld detection.
An audio expert's analysis of all recorded sounds will determine the frequency of the bats' conversations and what type of things they do.
A habitat map and report will be created later to provide a picture of their behavior in detail on the landscape scale.
Rob Dior, Nature Dialog Consultant for NTS, hopes the results will show which parts of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each of their species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of a grassland and how forests can be maintained for bats and other species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout England have declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk due to the construction of buildings and development activities that lead to habitat loss for them.
Northern turbines and lighting can also pose a risk of attack from home appliances, as can toxic paper and a number of other chemical fertilizers used in home construction.
Bats are not blind in nature.
However, due to the habit of night hunting, their ears are more useful in sensing food than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated biomechanical technique to remove insects and other obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats seriously.
The foundation has 10 trained cashiers who regularly carry out reconnaissance, night patrols and sometimes rescue missions.
The foundation has even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Treff Building in Domhfraise and Galway, which includes ten species, eight of which are Scottish bats.
Building manager David Thompson says that this is the place for them to come up with ideas.
He said, "Here in Trife, we have created the best field for bats".
"We have considered old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitats.
But there are many things that haven't been revealed about bats, so what we do here and at other foundations will help us to learn about what they do to succeed".
He emphasizes the importance of bat searching before building buildings because unwanted damage to a single habitat could kill up to 400 bats, young and perhaps all of their local populations.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing or disturbing them or destroying their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer, encouraged people to help with the bat-keeping fund.
"We still have a long way to go to learn about bats", he said, "and for many species of bats, we don't even know that their populations are struggling with life.
Ronaldo denies allegations of sexual assault when lawyers are preparing to appeal against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of sexual assault against him "fake news", saying that people "want to advertise using his name".
His lawyers are prepared to file a complaint against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Forward Portugal and Joynthos were accused of sexually assaulting an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Deer Spiegel reported on Friday that he was accused of having paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
While speaking to 142 million followers via Instagram live after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, reacted to the report, calling it "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in front of the camera.
"They will make a name for themselves by my name.
This is normal.
They want to make a name for themselves by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well", the player added with a smile on his lips.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a complaint against Spiegel's allegations of reporting unacceptable suspicions in the area of privacy",
Lawyer Christine Seritz said the player "wants moral losses in response to a serious breach that may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palm and Ksenny Hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he raped her from the back.
Miurga claims Ronaldo had kneeled in front of him after the incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good man", and said he would leave out "one percent".
Documents claim that Ronaldo admitted to having had sex with the woman, but this was done by mutual agreement.
Miurga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her wounds taken in the hospital with her but later agreed to the settlement out of court because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman said she had refused to accept the offer because she suffered trauma as a result of the incident.
Ronaldo was due to leave Manchester United to join Real Madrid at the time of the sexual assault allegations, and in the summer he joined Italian Giants Juventus for €100 million.
UK Brexit may be a 'always regret' loss to motor manufacturers
Commerce Minister Greg Clark said that if England loses its position as a world leader in car production after Brexit, it will be "for ever regrettable".
He added that it was "of concern" that UK Airways told the BBC that if the UK left the EU, without a deal, the company would temporarily halt production at its Brnaston factory, near Derby.
Mr. Clark said, "We need a deal",
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border delays during the no-deal Brexit could be a burden on the duty.
The Brennaston factory - which produces Toyota Aris and Owens cars - produced nearly 150,000 cars during the past year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in Aruba.
Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Breston, said: "My view is that the UK will leave the EU by the end of March and we will see production at our factory halted".
Other UK manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a contract about how cross-border trade will operate.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for the month following Brexit.
The main concerns about what the automakers say will be the risks of supply chains during a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line was "very timely", with parts for cars ordered from other suppliers in the UK and EU being delivered in 37 days.
If England leaves the EU without a contract by March 29, there may be disruptions at the borders that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to wait longer than its inventory costs at its late-night factory, and production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future communications with the EU is "precisely calibrated to prevent these checks at the borders".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract we can, as we say, not only serve as a source for now, but also take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The benefit not only to Toyota, but to other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to fully sustain our supply chain successfully".
Toyota could not say when it would halt production, but warned in the long run that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, reduce the number of job opportunities.
Peter Quarris, who has worked at the Breston factory for 24 years and is the organizer of the United Union in the factory, said that the union's members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these job opportunities are lost, they will not return.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
The White House said on Sunday that Trump's senior meetings with Deputy Sergeant Rod Rosenstein may once again be postponed for "another week" as debates continue over the court's top candidate, Britt Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein is responsible for overseeing the work of the Special Council, Robert Mueller, which assesses Russian interference in elections, Trump-Russia aid relations, and the potential prevention of the president's execution of justice.
Whether Trump will remove Deputy Lieutenant Colonel, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has been a source of controversy in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that the wearing of Mike by Rosenstein to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the presidency through the 25th Amendment by Rosenstein had been discussed.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House last Monday, during the broadcast of reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was postponed due to the president's participation in the United Nations summit in New York on Thursday.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford said Trump said he would "prefer not to remove Rousenstein", but the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of treating him testified.
On Friday, Trump issued a week-long investigation order from the FBI against the charges against Kavanaugh, which also delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's media secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Responding to a question about Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that given all the things going on in the courtroom, the meeting may be postponed for another week.
But we see and always love to inform the media about the news".
Some reporters may object to the claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the information was not in the interests of the TV reporters, saying it was "attracting attention".
He then said that the media's direct contact with Trump would increase.
Without providing evidence, he said, "The president holds more Q&A sessions than any previous president", "We have looked at the statistics".
Information will be provided, Sanders said, but "if the media gets the opportunity to raise their questions about the United Nations directly with the president, it will be better to talk to me.
We will try to do this and you have seen us do it over the past few weeks and the session where you can talk to the president about the United Nations will be the opening of a press conference".
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with other officials.
Individual press conferences are very few.
During the week-long run in New York, the president showed why by taking media style and sometimes inappropriate appearances to reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's legal position and to wish for Brexit to follow.
Jane Freeman sent MSP a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of relocation status requests for EU citizens working in the public sector.
Ms Freeman wrote in the letter: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on a withdrawal from the EU have been ongoing and are heading towards an expected decision in the Treasury.
But the UK government is still prepared for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this may be an uncomfortable time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to tell you how much the contribution of every employee, regardless of their identity, is worth to me.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond have brought us valuable experience and skills that have strengthened and improved the healthcare profession and have been beneficial to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is a perfect home for the masses, and we would very much like you to stay".
Christine Abiercombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury.
Mike O'Rgan said Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christine Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after coming off the injury line in a 27-31 loss to Windsorbeat Commodores on Sunday.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told the fans that he was injured shortly after the half.
Reed said, "We came to the side of the line and fell there".
Teachers and medical personnel on the sidelines gave him oxygen before he was placed on the medical examination and transferred for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abeercrombie had emerged from the operating room of the Windberth Medical Center.
Harris added that "no further details are available on the type/size of the wound", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
AmberCrombie, a redshirt sophomore after transferring from Illonius, is in his first season with Tennessee State.
He had a total of five fights on Saturday before leaving, bringing his rookie season to 18.
When buying a building in the UK, foreign buyers are required to pay more taxes.
Under the new Tory Plan, when foreign buyers purchase a building in the UK, they will be required to pay more taxes and extra money to help homeless people.
This would neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
Increased tax evasion costs will impose tariffs on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The fund is expected to increase to £120 million in one year - to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged more tax incentives when they buy property in England - with extra money to help homeless people.
The move will serve as an attempt to neutralize the Corbyn Movement to attract young voters with promises of affordable housing and target high-income individuals.
Tax cuts in the form of tariffs on non-taxable individuals and factories in the UK will be imposed with an additional bridge, which will increase the ability of government to deal with the homeless.
Additional costs - which in addition to the current tax bracket, including high levels of costs introduced two years ago for second homes and permits to purchase - can be as high as three percent.
The treasury is expected to grow to £120 million in one year.
The 13th century estimate of new London buildings was imposed by non-residents in London, which led to rising prices and challenging the first home buyers to step into the first tier.
Many of the country's affluent areas - especially in the city centre - have become "ghost towns" due to foreign buyers, who spend a lot of their time abroad.
The new policy was introduced weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in tax incentive to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of raising property prices, saying they would not use it, and asked Ms. To cancel the shares in affordable housing to settle the "rescue housing crisis".
Mr. Corbin has proposed a series of reforms to residential housing, including a rental control and an end to "no-slow" evacuations.
He also wants the council to be given more authority to build new residences.
"I said last year that I would dedicate my prime ministership to fulfilling the English dream that life should be better for each of the new generations", she said.
And that means building a broken marketplace of safe houses.
Brittany will always be open to those who want to live, work and live their lives here.
However, it cannot be true that this is easier for those who do not live in the UK and for companies based abroad than the UK.
The dream of buying a home is far from being realized for many people, and the nakedness of homelessness is also a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland president Jack Ross says that his "ultimate ambition" is to run Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot, who is third in League One with just three points less than his highest, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club.
He joined the Lightning Stadium this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season in Rennes.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won the B Cup and that's it", Day told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child with my father, I grew up watching Scotland in the countryside, and that's what always drew me back.
This opportunity will only come when, though, I win the club's management".
The ancestors of the day as managers of the Sunderland Gang include Nick Educat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keaney, Gus Poit and Paolo Di Canio.
The former president of Alva Atlantic says he feels he is not afraid to pursue such a name in such a big club, while he has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is due to the scale of 'Can I hand this club over to the Premier League again?'
Due to the structure and facilities at the club, this is undoubtedly about the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I might only be successful here if I take the club back with them".
Ross has been working in the office for three years after working as a deputy director at Dumbarton and only 15 months at Hertz's coaching staff.
He then helped Alva avoid falling into the third row and in the following season, he led Saint-Marin from the brink of fall to the championship win.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable with the work he has done in his playing career at Slade, Hartlepool, Fal Creek, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
He recalled a time when he took responsibility for the alva, "It was probably a real quarrel",
"I really believed that the office was more suitable for me than playing.
It's strange because I did well, and I made a good life for myself and enjoyed a number of high positions.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many things you have to endure week after week.
I still suffer from anxiety and work pressure, but I feel like I'm in the right place.
I always wanted to have an office job, and now that I'm doing it, I feel like I've been more comfortable than ever in my adult life".

The survey reveals that the best time to drink is Saturday afternoon at 5.30pm.
The summer heat wave has increased the level of referrals to pubs in Brighton, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in July - but visits to restaurants fell to 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultancy employee, who complained about the figures, said: "England's sustained sunburn and unexpected long-term stretch at the World Cup made the July model as durable as last month, as pubs saw a 2.8% increase except for the restaurants that suffered heavy losses.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant business during June continued to worsen in July.
Pubs and liquor trucks have had their strongest performances ever, more than restaurants whose business had declined.
Food stalls were also affected by the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for alcohol.
Sales of alcohol across pubs and bars operated for the month reached 6.6 percent and fell to three percent in restaurants.
Paul Newman, entertainment and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue to be the same as we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social and sporting events, including major factors in sales in the marketplace, are outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-on-year is painful, especially in the face of sustained cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't get any worse for food service providers, and time will tell if we can experience the lower temperatures in August, the rest we need".
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including those that opened recently, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand listings.
The Troker's Split-Coffer Industry Sales Monitor for the UK pubs, bars and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups totaling £9 billion, an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has hidden social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Surveys reveal that one in five children - some of whom are 11 years old - have opened secret social media accounts that they have hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students appeared on the pages of "Fake-Insta".
This has sparked fears about the sexual content they are looking at.
Twenty percent of the disciples said they had a "real" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some of whom are reaching the age of 11 - has created social media accounts that they have hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that there has been a rapid growth in fake-instance accounts - Instagram, a photo-sharing reference.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Nearly a hundred students said they were operating through their proper "original" accounts to show their parents while also owning other secret accounts.
A mother who learned about her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found out that the teenager wanted others to "rape me".
The survey, launched by Digital UK Awareness and the Independent Schools Headteachers' Conference (HMC), found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two accounts and half of those did not keep their accounts secret.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said, "It is devastating that so many teenagers are lured into creating an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elide Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Atlantic Scotland Board
Elide Doyle was elected to the Atlantic Board of Scotland as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Government Office.
Doyle, one of the most accomplished desert and field athletes and the president of Inbetween, called the move a great opportunity to guide others into the sport who can benefit from his extensive experience internationally.
"Elid Hale is highly respected throughout Scotland, England and the world athletic community and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from bringing him on stage", said Betty.
"I am interested in acting as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute to Scottish sport and help guide the sector", Doyle said.
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, is currently a BBC pundit who was unable to walk after being hit by a passing schizophrenia attack.
She tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago today.
I was unable to walk.
Doctors said that only time can tell how much and how much I will recover.
It was a painful thing to do, but I recovered my health and learned to walk, and today I can do the drills of agility.
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The breast pump announcement, which likened mothers to cows, divided online theories into two parts.
A breast pump company has split online theories regarding the announcement that mothers milk ten cows who fall.
To reopen what is said to be the "newest breast-wearable off-the-shelf pump", consumer technology company Illy has released an exciting music video that draws inspiration from the announcement, which represents the freedom that the new pump gives to expressing mothers.
Four real mothers dance among a crowd of cows to a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I'm going to kill myself, but you can't see my tail" and "If you don't realize these are mammals, these are my breasts.
The song continues: "Pump them, pump them, honey, I feed them, pump them, pump them, I kill my women".
However, the announcement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of views, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "wildness" of the dairy industry.
"To announce this production, using cows was a bad decision.
One wrote, "They need to get pregnant and give birth just like us to produce milk, except for their babies, who are stolen from them a few days after they are born".

Another person commented: "It's understandably painful for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to announce a breast pump for mothers who should keep their babies for themselves?"
Another added: "What a far cry from feeling".
Others have defended the announcement, with one woman even admitting that the song was "funny".
"I think this is a great idea.
If I were still a milkman, I would buy one.
Pumping made me really feel like a cow.
This is a bit of a crazy announcement, but I've inferred it for what it is.
One wrote, "This is a great product".
Another commented: "It's an interesting advertisement aimed at women who pump (usually in the workplace or bathroom) and feel like they're 'cow.'
It is not a decree to judge or praise the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they are dancing with a pump mounted on their braces.
The main concept behind the campaign is based on the view that a large number of women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
Although the fuel pump is completely off, it has no cable or tube and is moved inside the nursing bra, giving the woman the freedom to take her children with her wherever she wants to go and even when they pump.
Anna Bellarine, co-founder and ECD at Mother, wrote: "The fuel pump is a revolutionary product that would be such a bold and provocative opening.
By creating equality between female speakers and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumps and all the related challenges, while also trying to illustrate this in a more interesting way, by providing a sense of freedom that is created by using this pump.
This is not the first time that the Illyrian pumps have been the headline of the media.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two was seen showing off the product by wearing a Martha Jacobusky.
Hundreds of migrant children were evacuated to a tent camp near the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained despite the unchanged border crossing has increased, as harsh language and policies by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to assign children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid of risking their own lives in the country by sponsoring a child.
The threats were intensified when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and adult family members would have to register their fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albines was brought before Congress because the agency had arrested a large number of individuals who had applied to sponsor homeless children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of these people live illegally with either the sponsor or the family members of the sponsors, and many of them are criminals.
We will continue to pursue these people", Mr. Albines said.
According to the Stellers staff, authorities who want children to be admitted to the process sooner have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of the 60-day deadline.
Many instead of physical presence, attended the court via video call to file a request for legal status with the immigration judge.
And all that are not able shall return to their own land.
According to shallow staff and reports circulated from the system in recent months, the more children are in custody, the more they become anxious or depressed, leading to violent beliefs or attempted escape.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are more widespread in larger foundations such as Torneillo, where children who try are often overlooked due to their size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to their friends can be a blow to many of these children.
Syria urges the US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
In a statement at the UN General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ad called on Syrian migrants to return to the country again, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
The teacher, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister of the UAE, said that foreign forces are illegally present on Syrian soil to fight terrorism and "will be treated as such".
He told the council, "They must leave immediately and unconditionally".
The teacher stressed that "the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over", where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until we clear our territory of terrorist groups and foreign illegal entities", he said.
The United States has 2,000 troops in the line, primarily tasked with advising and training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
A total of 1,000 French troops are stationed in the country.
In connection with the issue of migrants, the teacher said that the situation for their return was better and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading fear" to encourage migrants to leave.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian aid foundations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They politicize issues that should be entirely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no building aid to Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition at the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreements between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone on the territory of the last major rebel group in Idlib have provided an opportunity for negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented widespread persecution by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where millions of people live.
Although the teacher stressed that the understanding had "clearly accelerated", he said he hoped that the military operation would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra fighters, to "switch".
UN representative Stephen D'Ambrosio hopes to start the first meetings of the new committee, which will be composed of government and opposition members, to prepare the post-war legislation for a series and pave the way for elections.
The teacher presented the terms of government participation to the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to "passing the provisions of the current law" and warned against interference.
Why will Trump win the second round?
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many libertarian voters hope, the censure and scandal of his presidency does not end before the end of the term.
What is undeniable is that "this will be one of the most brilliant endings of the presidency!"
However, there are no signs of visual fatigue yet.
Since 2014, Prime-Time ratings have more than doubled from 1.05 million on CNN and 1.6 times more on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has a median of 2.4 million Prime Time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Richel Modou" has taken the top spot with a Kabylie rating of 3.5 million viewers on Big News nights.
Neil Bair, host of ABC drama "The Appointed Returns", about a cabinet minister who is framed as president after an attack on the center, said, "This is a fire where people are burned because that's not what we understand".
Neil Schuyl, former comedy writer and author of "Only Funny Parts: and a number of facts about hitting the Hollywood Kids' Club" has another theory.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston, before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Ms. Sewell said.
There is a recreational value to this mess.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, headlines from Washington could shape the future of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Adjustment is a favor that only the highest-rated viewer can take on.
And yet, when you find yourself in the six o'clock debate, experts are talking about Bob Woodward, who used "dark background" in the book "Fear" by Wish, or about $15,000 of leather-skinned bumpers (as Washington Pull called "a thick piece with a Hebris") and the results of Daniel's deceptive explanations of Mr. Trump, M.A., his anatomy.
I, alone, will never see a Super Mario like this.
"Part of what he does and what a person feels like watching a live show is that he feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, president of Will House Entertainment and founder of "Powstars", which is in the Trump program's Roundup Players Ward and where a new complexity is unfolding every day (he is at war with the NFL every day, praising Kim Jong-un).
You don't want to miss a single part or be left behind.
When I visited Mr. Flis this week, during a sunny day of 80 degrees outside his home in the northern foothills, he was sitting inside his home watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not hide from the fact that Brett Kavanaugh was due to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and that the future of the judiciary was involved on this scale.
Mr. Felis told me, "I remember when we were running crazy programs back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"
"I thought it was a joke, but as it happens today, they were telling the truth".

Out of the flood of money in the narrowest domestic elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the congressional renewal of the districts that included two factors for a single seat.
The transcript of the Pittsburgh suburb of Pitts County was done by Corner Lamp on behalf of Democrats - who had won a seat in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb, unlike the other candidate, is Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which has been heavily torn apart by the new 17th District.
The plans were rewritten after a January ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that former districts had been unlawfully merged in favor of Republicans.
The 17th flood created a financial campaign between the major party, the Financial Weapons, the Democratic Campaign Committee of the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name after a small victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which was widely observed.
The seat had been held by Republicans for a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given a small share to Democrats.
The United States pressured El Salvador to support China, which later relinquished it, by punishing El Salvador.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a private meeting with Panamanian President John Carlos Verrera in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama that later expelled the Trump Foundation management team partners.
Heider Noiret, a spokesman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials decided to repatriate the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions based in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "a recent debate over Taiwanese misidentification".
But the sanctions were imposed only on El Salvador, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including support for drug control, development and the economy.
The proposed penalties, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, may have been painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As domestic meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to follow up on last year's meeting on the same topics, which was held as a step in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear they wanted to hold a conference to end the sanctions on El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to make a statement at the following conference on the small mention of the department's imports in mid-October.
And three U.S. political representatives returned to El Salvador, Panama, the Dominican Republic, with no harsh messages from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the discussion by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal talks, subject to confidentiality of names.
Their accounts were confirmed by a foreign analyst, who maintained close ties to the office and continued to agree to speak on privacy issues.
Study of history
The next booth to be launched could be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr. Trump's failure to enforce justice, which is still substantially documented in public records.
According to reports, Mueller is also beginning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was in conflict with Russia that attacked our election.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will find himself accountable while preparing to go against the voters and perhaps the jury will take his place.
This is for a number of reasons, and I'm not suggesting that the fall of Mr. Trump - or his counterparts in Europe - is inevitable.
Here are the choices that all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make that will affect the principle of how long the effort will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the West resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to prevent years of massacre.
This historical trend is central to such inflationary trends, and the unspeakable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing.
Americans face a lot of these inflationary issues.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Secretary General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been burning in hot water since the newspaper reported last year that he had secretly recorded President Trump's voice and made rumors that he was unfit for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times' claims are false.
"What would we react to the newly proposed FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh if it wasn't fair - or if he was confirmed as the head of the prosecution despite allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And after all, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections to get Mr. Trump to account?
If we fail these tests, democracy will experience a long winter.
But I am confident that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was expelled from Auschwitz by the Nazis, who once occupied my embassy.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sunday candles on a table with the broken Nazi cross on it.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Essen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Foundation and President of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics at Washington, D.C., is the author of The Last Palace: A Turbulent Century in Europe in Five Lives and a Legendary House.
Graham Rangers is optimistic about the fight against Rapid Vienna.
Thursday's host Rapid Vienna, with knowledge of the Austrians' victory after a draw against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durham from making an appearance earlier this season, until scores were tied 2-2 against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use these results as a benchmark for better things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villerillo is a good side", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came back with a score.
Maybe we could have turned the game around in the end, but overall, the result was fair.
I think they were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
With Thursday's departure, another big European night is upon us.
We hope to get three points from it, but this game will be difficult because they have done well in their last game, but with people behind us, I am sure we can try and get a good result.
It was a really tough year, in the midst of all the things that happened to my knee injury and the changes that happened at the club, but now there's a factor that makes me feel good.
Our group is good and the kids enjoy it, the education is good.
We hope we can go ahead, put the past season behind us and win.
Women are sleeping in fear of retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a number of people spoke to their families about it.
Nearly half of these people in the nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
Holly Snyder, deputy insurance trade across the country, said, "People want family members to look after them but they are not taking the steps to start this discussion".
You can start there.
Speak unto thy wives and thy children, saying, Ye cannot feed your household, unless ye lay your own needs before them.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how care should be obtained and those choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you propose a way to cover the costs.
Your long-term financing options can include a regular long-term insurance policy, a combined cash value policy to cover these expenses, or to insure yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Bring forth your legal documents; go forth to the legal battles.
Get a health care proxy so you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals are able to fit your needs if you cannot speak.
Also, consider a security for your financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the bills are paid if you cannot.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents are facing a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about the drug and its allergies?
Move these details into a written plan to be ready.

A man was shot multiple times by an air rifle in an elfracombe
A man was shot several times with a pistol while walking home during the night.
The 40-year-old victim was insane in Oxford Grove Elphracombe when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
They did not see the attacker's victim.
His wounds are not severe and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said that while the death toll has been increasing, at least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday.
While communication facilities have been destroyed, officials have been unable to obtain information about the Donggala site, a region in northern Palo Alto that was closer to the center of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the Palo catastrophe, more than 16,000 were evacuated.
Some key facts about Palo and Dongla on Sulawesi Island are as follows:
Palo is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the eastern shores of Sulawesi Island with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
The Dongla Plateau is located along the northeastern coastline of Sulawesi Island, about 300 kilometres (180 mi).
It is an administrative region under the province and its population in 2017 was 299,200.
Fishing and agriculture are important economic resources of Central Sulawesi province, especially the Dongla coastal area.
Nickel mining is also important in the province of Haifa, but much of it is located in Murli, on the Sulawesi coast.
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, Indonesia, Palo and Dongla have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongla.
Another tsunami occurred in Dongla in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Seismic activity and is usually hit by earthquakes.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in Georgia in recent years are as follows:
2004: A severe earthquake struck the western coast of Indonesia's Isfahan province, north of Samarta, on December 26, striking a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean and much of the other half in Isfahan.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Neja, off the coast of Smartha.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake in southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, caused a tsunami that swept across the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake quake near Padang, the capital of South Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake quake hit the Mintawa Islands twice as fast as Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed many of the villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the Pedi Jaya area in Isfahan, causing the destruction of homes and creating panic among people as it reminded them of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: A major earthquake on the Indonesian tourist island of Lumbok caused the death of 500 people in the northern part of the island.
And the earthquake broke down thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were in prison.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Turk Palin, the eldest son and former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of harassment.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Pauline was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman asked him to call the police and report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
KTUU reported that Palin was held in the Met-Sou building prior to the hearing and on bail of $500.
The network reported that he appeared in court on Sunday, where he was asked if he accepted the charges, calling himself "guilty".
Pauline is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to one year in prison and fined $250,000.
He was also convicted of Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Pauline has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, she was accused of raping her father, Tad Paulin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic abuse, interference with reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an accident.
And his girlfriend accused him of striking him in the face.
After her son was linked to the PSTD by the brutal treatment he had suffered during his service in Iraq, Sarah Palin was criticized by the military group earlier in 2016.
Tsunami of Indonesia: Voices are dead
Nearly 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.5, caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake shook the centre of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show moments of the quake.
When the tsunami struck, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palo.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for suspected NYC terrorists
Federal prosecutors in New York for Sypholo Sipov, suspected of launching a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, are seeking the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been applied to federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Sipov, 30, is accused of hiring a heavy truck to carry out an attack on a motorcycle sidewalk along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which led to the removal of pedestrians and cyclists on the sidewalks in October.
According to the intent notice for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify the sentencing, prosecutors must prove that Sipov killed eight victims in an "international" manner and inflicted serious injuries in an "international" manner.
According to court documents, both courts may issue a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court charged Sipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of attempted murder, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in planned criminal cases, including one count of assault and the destruction of a vehicle.
While prosecutors called the attack "planned and deliberate", the order in which Sipov carried it out was described as "frightful, cruel and corrupt".
The statement said "Cefolo Habibaluik Sipov has caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Evangeliini, Nicholas Cleviss, N-Lora Dicad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erleigh, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pignoko".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York sentenced someone to death.
Defendant Khaled Bernice was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had married after they were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death by electronic stoning on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Sipov, whose original citizenship is from Uzbekistan, showed less remorse during the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told the investigator that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the criminal complaint, Sipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he continued to ask for ISIS flashes to be thrown into his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Sipov, said they were "obviously disappointed with the prosecutor's decision".
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting his crime and imprisoning him for life without the possibility of his release will only cause long-term damage to all those involved", said Patton.
Sipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to sentence him to death.
Tori MP says Nigel Farag should be appointed as the head of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farag today, during a protest at the Tory conference, swore to 'mobilize the people's need'.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should have felt the 'German pessimists of Europe' - as one member of the Trisha parliament suggested that he should be appointed as the head of negotiations with the ARA.
Conservative legislature member Peter Boone, speaking at a march in Birmingham, said that if Mr Farrag had been Brexit minister, Britain would have 'separated from the EU'.
But the challenge Ms. Mei faces in her deeply divided appeasement department has been highlighted by the already remaining Tories who have launched their protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the war plan in place during the attacks by the Brexiters, the rest of the EU and the G20 leaders.
Allies stressed that he would continue to work to strike a deal with Brussels, despite the reactions - and pressure from European pessimists and workers - to choose one of the options 'between his package and chaos'.
Mr. Boone told protesters that going out meant going out in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw away the chickens'.
He suggested that Mr. Farag should be given the status of a colleague and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was the supervisor, we might be out now,' she said.
Member of Parliament Willingbro added: 'I stand with Brexit, but we must put the Chukers away.
While declaring his position against the EU, he said: 'We have not participated in global wars because we are dominated.
We want our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Boone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote. 'The theory that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false.'
Brexit leader Andrea Jenkins also took part in the protests, telling reporters: 'I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chukras are not popular among the people, the opponents will not vote, this is not common in the party and among our activists who are going to the streets and choose us at the first opportunity.
Please leave the candles and listen to us.'
In a message containing tips to the lady, he added: 'The ministers of the state keep their positions when they carry out their commitments.'
Mr Farag told protesters that politicians should be forced to have a 'feel of warmth' if they are to rebel against the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is about trust between us - our people and our political class", he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them, 'We will not allow you to do this.'
In a message to the crowd, he said: 'I want you to force the political class on the brink of betrayal to Brexit to feel this heat.
'We will mobilize the people's power of this country that won us Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.'
However, the Remnants continued their demonstration along the backdrop of their two-hour protests in the City Center.
A group of activists reacted to the tourism after the opening of the group during the weekend by placing banners.
Lord Adonis's colleagues derided the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the start of the conference due to the party's toolkit.
'They are the ones who tell us that they can have IT systems including all the technology for Canada plus for borderless borders, for free borderless trade in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a complete imitation.
There is nothing better than a good Brexit", he added.
Warren will be "gradually thinking" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think seriously" for a presidential nomination.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday, during a session at the Western Massachusetts Salon.
Warren, one of President Donald Trump's frequent critics in the November re-election, has shared a vote against GOP state representative Jeff Dahl, who is Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign manager.
He is under the spotlight of speculation that he may be in Trump's post in 2020.
The occasion was the 36th meeting of the legislature, using the Ton Hall format, on Saturday afternoon in Dreyfoos, since Trump began his term.
One participant asked if he planned to run for president.
Verne responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and revive a broken government, and that requires a woman at the leadership level".
An arrest has been made in connection with the shooting and killing of Sims LSU.
Police in Beton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Smith was arrested on Friday.
The Police Department of Beton Rouge announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson at ET at 11 a.m. on the 20th.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near the South campus.
Police Chief Murphy J. Powell told 247 Sports on Saturday, "Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result".
Wade came forward to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene and to having a gun and admitting to shooting Wyde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in the custody of the East Roge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 teenager who played in the Rogue Berg concrete, Sims appeared in 32 games during the past season, starting 10, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per contest.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team's victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valteri Botas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday and that Mercedes would play a big part of the match.
From the start of the match, Butas got off to a good start, almost leading Hamilton to the danger zone while defending his position in two laps and allowing Whiteley to attack his team member.
Vitel Nest went to the flowers and left Hamilton to run on the backs of the bags among the bears, which was bound to happen.
The Mercedes later went down the range and was seen from behind the Wheel, but Hamilton went ahead after several wheel-to-wheel operations, which saw the Ferrari driver in the high-risk interior, after a double move to defending the third corner.
Max Wirstappen started from the back of the building and finished the first span during his 21st birthday, taking the seventh span.
He then moved on to a larger part of the race, as he focused on his tyres to finish a fast finish and move on to fourth place, ahead of Kimi Raikkonen.
He also drove in the 44th-domain wells but was unable to accelerate in the remaining eight as Rickonin was in the fourth.
It was a difficult day because Walter did a great job during all the weekends and was a gentleman who allowed me to.
The team did an exceptional job that made us a seed of two", Hamilton said.
That was a very bad skin.
President Trump ridiculed Senator Danny Finestine in a march on Saturday over his insistence on not disclosing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court's candidate, Britt Kavanaugh, of sexual harassment.
While addressing a marching delegate in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "backward, dirty and wrong".
"What could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate these past few days, when you see anger, the world you see people are angry, mean and dirty and wrong", he said.
"When you look at the magazines and the discoveries, then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, have you made a statement?
Remember his answer? Did you reveal the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we reveal... No, we did not reveal", he added, imagining the senator.
A letter was sent to Finstein in July, detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford, and was uncovered in early September - but Finstein denied the disclosure by his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, but I did not reveal his story", Hill reported, Finstein told the committee.
And he said, I will keep it secret, and I will keep it secret, as he said.
But his denial didn't seem acceptable to the president, which led him to speak about it during a Saturday night march. "I'll tell you one thing, that was a very ugly speech.
Perhaps he didn't, but you are the most lazy person I have ever seen".
In defending the candidate of the right-wing party, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges to their advantage.
"They are determined to regain power in whatever form it is.
You see their dirt, they don't think about who they're hurting, who they're going to put their foot down to get power and control", Meditey reported from the president's office.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 3-5 Belfast Giants
Patrick Doyer scored two goals against Dundee.
Dundee Stars, who played in the Elite League on Friday, lost to Belfast Giants, a team that returned to the competition on Saturday, winning the match 3-5.
Giants scored two goals early in the match, with a strike by Patrick Doyer and Francis Wheeler.
Mike Sullivan and Jarden Connie took the ball to their side before Devere Giants won.
Francois Bouchard scored even points for Dundee before Lucas Lundwall's goal won the NLCS to secure them.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Men's Edmonton, who came back from Friday night to beat Dundee 1-2 at Belfast.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two sides, which resulted in the Giants winning their third title.
The quarter-finalist came on in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFall, when Wheeler scored the second goal four minutes later, assisted by David Rutherford.
During a busy start, Sullivan re-entered the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt tied Connie at 15:16.
When he scored his second goal at the end of the first period, Doyer ensured Giants had the lead during the first half.
The side of the group was re-established and boards in the 27:37 minute, once again putting them in a strong goal-play condition.
Connie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Milsen score the first goal in the second leg and he made sure to finish the final leg, also the fifth leg, in the semi-final.
The Jayne team, who have lost their last four matches, will face Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die but ensure that hundreds of plane passengers can escape the earthquake.
He is hailed as a hero by an air traffic controller after he ensured that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing due to the earthquake that hit Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The city of Palo was shaken by strong earthquakes, and a large number of people were trapped in the ruins.
But despite his peers fleeing the field to save his life, 21-year-old Anthony Sinhavan Agong refused to flee his duty at the floating control tower at El Jafri Paolo Airport.
He remained there to ensure that flight 6321 of Battic Air, which was in the airport band, was safe to fly.
He jumped from it after thinking the traffic control tower code would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
ABC News Australia reported that Indonesian air traffic control spokesman Johannes Seray said his decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpaapan in Kalimantan to transport her to a larger hospital in another city.
But unfortunately we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palo.
"When we heard about it, our hearts broke", he added.
This is while authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster reduction agency says access to Dongla, Sigi and Bolong cities is limited.
Representative Spokesperson Sotopo Porovo Nogueruho said, "The death toll appears to be still rising as many bodies remain under the rubble while most cannot be treated".
The wave, which reached a height of 6 meters, turned the bodies into ruins after the dead bodies were buried in a mass on Sunday.
Military and domestic aircraft transport aid and supplies.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The ambulance is moving bodies at any moment.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are robbed everywhere".
Jan Gilfand, director of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what we will achieve there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I want all of you to work day and night to complete any evacuation task.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already hit by the earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: New Guinea Airlines says a man has disappeared after the crash of a Laguna plane
The airline that operates the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said that a man had disappeared following previous statements about the safe evacuation of 47 passengers and crew from the plane.
New Guinea Airlines said in a news release that they could not find a male passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it had contacted local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the trail.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and members of the flight after the plane hit water while attempting to land at the Chuk Island airfield.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in hospital until Saturday and that they are all in good condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The United States Air Force and the United States Navy said the plane crashed in the lagoon due to lack of airport bands.
Several witnesses thought he had gone beyond the airport gate.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down too low.
Janice said, "This is a very good thing".
Jenis said that he and others were able to reach the water level of the sinking aircraft's exit gate.
He said that the flight crew were terrified and screaming, and he pulled a small wound from the area.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working nearby to improve the flooding and helped rescue passengers using a windship and transfer them to shore before the plane sank to 30 metres (100 ft).
Data from the Routing Security Network shows that 111 people have been killed in crashes involving PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none of these crashes involved New Guinea Airlines.
Analysts present a nighttime timeline that was burned alive.
Prosecutors closed the case Saturday with a new hearing of a man accused of setting fire to a living Mississippi woman in 2014.
The president was certified as a witness in intelligence analysis for many hours.
He provided a timeline for Heath's use of telephone records to track the movements of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tillis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers during the night she died.
Clarion Ledger reported that Roulette had obtained local information from a large number of phones that showed Telis was having dinner with Chambers on the day of her death.
When reports revealed that his phone was ringing during the time Chambers was talking to her friend Michelle Sanford, police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth about her claim that she was in Larry Sanford that night, Sanford said she was "lying because my Larry was in New York".
Another discrepancy was that Telis said she had known Chambers for two weeks before his death.
The records of the mobile phone showed that they had known each other for a week.
Roulette said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact details from her phone.
"He removed Chambers from his life", Hall said.
The defense set its closing discussions for Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be transferred to the jury later that day.
Goodies: What is hip hop conscious?
A hip hop artist wants to challenge negative views about the genre by enriching his music with a positive message.
Bristol-based hip hop group Blade has claimed that hip hop has moved away from its origins of conveying political messages and fighting social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop famous again.
Artists such as Fugis and Camon have witnessed the revival of this art in England through artists such as Akakala and Lucky.
A black person again?
A New York pediatrician is suing a couple for dismissal after a "discriminatory" message.
A New York pediatric nurse complained of a couple who dismissed her as discriminatory after receiving a misleading message from her mother about her complaint that "she was another black person".
The pair reject this statement as if it were a work of discrimination and they compare it to "forced".
Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed dismay that her new babysitter, Gisele Marrick, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flexman said to her husband in a message, "No, another black man",
However, instead of texting her husband, she texted Ms. Morrick twice.
According to the New York Times report, after realizing this mistake, Plesco-Faklesman dismissed Ms. Morika from her position, saying that their former child nurse, an African-American, had done a bad job and that she had instead agreed to have a Filipino nurse.
Ms. Morris was paid for her day's work and was sent home by taxi Uber.
Morris now complained of the couple for damages for dismissing him from duty and $350 a day for six months, something he had been set up for, of course without a contract.
He told Skin on Friday, "I want to show them, so you see, don't do this", and added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple reacted to the allegations, saying they were not discriminatory, adding that Morris's termination was reasonable because they feared they could not trust him after his abusive treatment.
And he said, My wife sent to him a message, which he did not say.
He is not discriminatory.
We are not discriminatory people", said the wife's husband, Joel Plasco, to the skin.
And will ye deliver up your children to the hand of one with whom ye have committed iniquity?
Your baby's baby?
Come again".
While liking the situation to "forced", Placebo said his wife gave birth to a baby two months ago and that he was "in a difficult situation".
"Will you go after someone like this?
It's not a good thing to do", the investment banker added.
While the case was ongoing, the public opinion court moved quickly to announce the couple on social media and condemned them for their behavior and logic.
The new letter suggests that publishers of Gann Paddington expressed concern that Gann singers would not be able to communicate with the beer-speaking bear.
The letter stated that the band's daughter, Karen Jenkins, was born shortly after the book was accepted. "It's a problem to walk into the boots of someone who first reads it before it gets published.
It's interesting to know what we know about your father's great achievement".
She said her father, who worked as a filmmaker with the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book by a playboy bear, may have thought that his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "sweetie tandy".
Regarding Paddington, who called him "a very important member of his family", he said that his father was slowly proud of his ultimate achievement.
"He was a very calm man and not a very energetic person", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to her, the situation was almost like having a baby who was achieving something: you were proud of him, even though you had no part in it.
I think he's the one who structured your father's success in this way.
Although it was his creativity and imagination, he always gave all the credit to his father".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On the ground, her daughter was transferred to Louis Postier 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
Ms. Eidnan Lapiroz said, "Bend was called back to say it and that he said he wasn't expected to do it".
"I got a phone call from Ned saying he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I will come to you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication that doctors gave her slowed her heart's pumping until her system finally stopped.
He had died a while ago and his system was shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, for I knew that it would be revealed.
I couldn't scream, or scream, or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
I had to control my emotions".
Finally, Mrs. Eidnan-Lapierre, who was in the grip of the loss of her daughter, sat down with other passengers - it was obvious what she was going through.
"No one knew", he said.
And I cast my head down, and there came tears from my eyes.
It's very difficult to express, but I was on a flight when I felt a great compassion for Ned.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him".
A woman in a hospital post a card to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent their lives being taken away by the vengeful.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries post cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Wiltshire Bridge so people can call those numbers for support.
My cousin Davies, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want other parents to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a committed cook with a beautiful smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up every room".
However, he left his job before he died because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Brother Taylor, who was 11 at the time, was the first person to see his brother commit suicide.
"I was alarmed that a secondary effect was occurring", Ms. Davis said.
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can visit and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphries, who was a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
"She didn't say she was sad or worried or anything", he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
She was extremely quiet on Christmas Day - when the kids opened the gift boxes, she didn't even look them in the eye or anything like that".
She said her death was a big blow to her family but they had to deal with the situation: "It has created a stir in our family.
He has separated us from one another.
But we have to face this reality and fight it".

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is postponed as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we got something in principle, like what he demanded a time-limited, scope-limited investigation, we could perhaps create a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, expressing his fear that the committee would "disappear" during the party's consolidation.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to investigate?
All of them are just a matter of time.
The midterm elections will be held over five weeks and will be held on November 6 - if the Republicans, as expected, perform poorly, then they will be severely criticised in their efforts to elect a man to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him, he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI reports?
A vote will begin in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently seated.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kwanzaa will be able to get at least 50 percent of the vote in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to draw equal votes and be confirmed for the position of chief justice.
North Korean fugitives under Kim's rule have been 'reduced'
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased since Kim came to power seven years ago.
Park Byung-siog, citing information obtained from the Ministry of the Union of the South, said that the number of fugitives had increased to 1,127 last year from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter controls on the border between North Korea and China and high smuggling rates were key factors for people's transportation.
Pyongyang did not comment on the public hearing.
South Korea grants citizenship to the vast majority of North Korean refugees.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of these people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easy to cross the heavily protected wireless zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers fugitives as illegal immigrants instead of refugees and usually forces them to return.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met for a Pyongyang pain talks, which focused on nuclear disarmament talks.
The statement was issued after a historic June meeting between Donald Trump, President of the United States, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on mutual terms to advance work on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Pennsylvania.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho accused the United States of impeding sanctions afterwards.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ray said, "Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
Nancy Pelosi reads Britt Cavanaugh "a victim of a mental illness" and says she is not fit to carry out a court case.
Minority House leader Nancy Pelosi, the court's nominee, called Britt Kavanaugh "a victim of a mental illness", saying she was not fit enough to serve on the court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said on Thursday during his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, "I can't imagine if a woman did this, they would consider her a 'positive' woman".
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexual harassment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening of the statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at one point even screamed and cried when she spoke about her family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "inappropriate and coordinated character killing" planned by the Libertarians as a result of their anger over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve as chief justice because his testimony showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think Coco is taking himself out of the race by making such statements and arrangements that he made to the Clintons and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi sat down in response to a question whether he would like to summon her if Kavanaugh were confirmed and if Democrats hold a majority of the vote in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this", Pelosi said, "if he doesn't tell Congress and the BFI the truth, then he's not only unfit for the court's top position, but he won't be eligible to be on the court that is now acting",
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the Circuit Court of Appeals of the DC.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential sentences against the Affordable Care Act or on Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh sidelined questions about whether he would reverse the court's specific ruling.
Pelosi said, "It's not like people who are stressed, or are arrogant, go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this great?'"
And women need to work on it.
This is a true criticism, months and years of anger and she still can't get it out without crying.
Mrs. Steinem told me after 45 years, "When we get angry, we cry".
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think so?"
She continued, "A woman helped me a lot, who was an executive somewhere, who said she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry, and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm dumb, because I'm crying.
I am angry".
And then he continued on.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are a form of anger discharge because so much has been understood about them.
One of my most memorable memories of one of my early duties in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself confronted with unruly anger, was that an older woman, Zach, grabbed me by the neck - an angry manager I had always been afraid of - who had dragged me into sex.
And he said unto me, Let them not see thee weeping.
They know not that thou art angry.
They think you're dumb and they'll be happy about it because that's what they were aiming for".
Patricia Scroeder, who later served as a Representative from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was thrown out of the race for unlawful relations on an outdoor business ship named Minky, Ms. Scroeder was deeply disappointed, finding that there was no reason why she would not run for president.
He told me 30 years later, smiling, "This was not a decision to think right".
"Seven other candidates were also in the race at the time and the last thing they needed was to add another candidate.
And they called it Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
As he later joined the campaign, he lagged behind in the financing section and vowed not to enter the business unless he got $2 million in funding.
It was a losing battle.
She learned that a number of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
He asked, "Do they think I'm getting a discount?"
When he made a statement announcing that he would not launch an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for those who would support him, disillusionment with the system that had challenged the committee's ability to raise funds to target voters instead, and anger at gender discrimination - which choked him.
Ms. Scordir recalled how the media reacted to her, "You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown".
"You may have thought that Clinsex was the sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking, "What will they leave on my grave stone?"
"She cried?"
The US-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing.
Experts say the initial pretexts for the start of a trade war between the United States and China were loud, and while the war is far from over, a scratch between these countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing a tax on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant tightening was the new tariffs this week, which affect $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which will affect all products imported from China into the United States.
Beijing has responded with kind words each time, and more recently with tariffs of five to ten cents on $60 billion of American products.
China has pledged to react to any action by the United States and this is unlikely to have a negative impact on the world's second largest economy anytime soon.
Returning Washington from the practice means a downfall in demand, but kneeling down to the United States in the presence of the world would be a shameful act for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say that if Beijing operates properly, the US-led trade war with China could be supported positively in the long run, through mutual reliance on both economies.
Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on the new American security for Asia in Central, said, "The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that could lead to a decline in one of these countries and that could be more dangerous than previous predictions".
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' for return of migrants
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of migrants and is asking for help to evacuate the country that has been devastated by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Vlad Al-Majad said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, his stable situation is safer, thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorism to return to normal.
All conditions for voluntary return are for the voluntary emigrants who were forced to flee the country due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more are still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'ad said the Saudi regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that had financed the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA, with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States of America has now lost six straight European titles and has not won a Ryder Cup race in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown of victory when the Danish team captain, Toms Jørn, scored 14.5 points, which was needed to defeat the United States.
The USA star, Phil Michaelson, who tried throughout the tournament, shot three shots in the water in the Par-3 16th, resulting in the match being abandoned to Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Mullinari has excelled well in all formats of the game, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by the lowest player in the European team, Turbjørn Olliesen of Denmark, 5&4.
John's biggest player, Handin Johnson, took 2nd place and Ian Poller of England, who may have been his last Ryder Cup match, took 1st place.
Former Ryder Cup winner Sergio Gracia was named European Champion with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't hold back my tears.
It was a very difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the Cup for you again.
It's about the team. And I'm so happy I was able to help", said the emotional grief after the European Championships.
He gave the torch to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who defeated US golfing genius Tiger Woods by scores of 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly honoured to have defeated Tiger Woods", said 23-year-old Rahm, "because I grew up watching this man's contests".
Woods lost all three of his matches in France and Riard is now 13-21-3 in his Red Cup campaign.
A curious figure plots one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team struggled to find ways to break free during all of the R-week holidays, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Forke of the United States of America said after his team's disappointing performance, "I am proud of these men, they fought.
And we went out this morning, and we set fire to the whole of Europe.
We threw it away.
Good for Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players shone well.
We're going to rebuild the group, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Reader's Cup committee again, and we're going forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to have served as their source as captain.
You should tip your hat.
We're ahead of the curve".
Red Fashion News: Focus on Penelope, Manati and Sarawatha is decreasing
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the concentration of redfinch and redfinch in some areas of the Tampa Bay Area.
According to the FWC, the condition of the fragmented cavities in Peninsula, Manatee, Saracento, Charlotte and Collier Counties has been reported - suggesting a decrease in concentration.
The red tidal islands cover approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pennines to the southern counties of Lee.
The fragments can be seen 10 miles off the coastal ridges of Hillsborough County, but a number of these images date back to the previous week.
The tides and tides have also been observed in the Piscot Quinte.
Average concentrations in Peninsula County seaports were reported during the past week, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations in Manitoba, low to high concentrations in Sarasota County, low to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations in Coeur d'Alene and low to low concentrations in Collier County.
There are reports of respiratory burns in Pinellas, Mantee, Saracento, Lee and Collier.
Breathing burns were not reported only in northwestern Florida during the past week.
