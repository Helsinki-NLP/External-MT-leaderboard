This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that had been popular before, but it also sheds light on details that fossils are not usually able to reveal - such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown above and light or orange-yellow on the sides.
The discovery may also shed light on the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed tongue called a wing, but they had other features of the feather - feathers and scales - researchers concluded that feathers were likely the result of later evolution.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was used not for flight but to regulate temperature or to attract attention. The researchers concluded that although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern referred to the adult feather, not a drawer.
The researchers suggested that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the pattern suggests adult plumage, not juvenile plumage.

Candidates can send representatives to observe all steps of the process, and the votes are counted by volunteers in the evening, following well-defined procedures and under strict supervision.

Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PH is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control experiment were kept under strict surveillance by rangers as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
The NPWS and the NSW Sport Shooting Federation (SSAF) have jointly recruited trained volunteers for the SSAF hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, the four shooters selected for the first launch have received comprehensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member provisional election board yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the termination of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October.
Violent protests in some places have been triggered by the failure of elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that 27 had been informed of the equipment accident.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
"The department responded by calling it "extremely regrettable" that Apple's announcement was delayed".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time.
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency says there's been no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reports no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with an M16.
Several hostages have been rescued, but at least six others are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took over the position of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital.
Liggins, while working at the hospital, took time off to study preterm birth.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone can speed up the development of a fetal lung.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremism, my first manager, Luna died two nights ago, she was very unique, just like you, a strong woman".
"Dustin Goldust Runnels remarked that Luna was at least as weird as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place now".
In the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the proportion of 1,400 people polled who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard campaigned in the 2010 federal election to claim that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of voters agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the survey's extreme values, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have competed in the 100- and 200-meter dashes and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints raised doubts about her strength.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to relieve the pain because they're banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
A number of people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, which was then announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the largest suppliers of water to Earth, along with the organic matter that makes up proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the formation of the Earth after comets struck the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
Some say he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport facilities, no surface trains will stop at Wembley and no parking and P+R parking spaces will be available.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the game being forced to continue behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report the appearance of a new species, a cross between the native medium ground spiny (Geospiza fortis) and a new species, the large cactus spiny (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even into small pieces.
It is thin, easily twisted and drawn into a wire, and can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and stick to other metals, and it can be so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate illuminated manuscripts and hand-painted images.
It's called chemical pH, and the red peppered soup can be used to make an indicator.
The color of the cabbage varies according to how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons formed by electron donation (as the hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which creates a strange sensation and creates a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of canal systems have been found in houses in the cities of Crete and Minos, Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mixed in.
When you call someone on the phone who's thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite in space receives the transmission and sends it back to Earth almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that we've gotten from the wheel is that it's made transportation so much easier and faster.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a special activity that all cats follow, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called packs.
The flocks are one to three related males and up to 30 females and young.
Females are generally more closely related to each other, having a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave surprisingly similarly to wolf packs or dog packs, animals that behave similarly to lions (but not like other big cats) and are very lethal to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (Genus Panthera) is a member of the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four big cats are the only ones that can howl.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-blown roar of a lion, but rather a phrase made up of words shouted in a whisper.
Ocelots are fond of eating small animals, and if they can, they will also catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots detect animals by tracking their scent (prey) on the ground.
They are very good at seeing in the dark because they have night vision and are stealthy, and the parrot cat hunts its prey by getting into the environment and then striking its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it crosses a mountain or a river, or if it crosses a new island and cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it needed before.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants are able to produce oxygen for humans to breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide for humans to breathe out.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plant, and without plants, no animals would survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except another mosasaur.
Its long jaws will have more than 70 razor blades and a line of lip plates so that nothing gets in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a fork-tongue, feeding on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, maybe even cannibals.
At the same time, it attacked anything that got into the water; even a dinosaur as massive as T. rex couldn't match it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent, the nutcracker.
The other difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, rich men enjoyed banquets where they would eat side by side.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that came to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to their gods and priests and tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurts, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the deity.
Because of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
The Hebrew family lived outdoors for most of its life.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were open counters facing the street, and the houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so the tree was an extremely valuable commodity.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already there.
Although all of these countries were Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed in many ways.
If you've seen the movie The Golden Age, you might think that it's a treasure map engraved on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776, is written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence".
Although the identity of its writer is uncertain, it is known that shortly after its completion the large parchment document (29.1 inches long and 24.5 inches wide) was stored in a folded box.
So it's likely that the mark was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent fighting liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part remained unfree.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, an invasion dubbed Operation Dragon.
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture that is shared by a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin words civilis, civis and civitas, meaning citizen, citizen, or city or city-state, the latter of which also determines the size of society to some extent.
The civilized fabric involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence and are therefore not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first established a weak central government - with Congress as its sole constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no taxing power, and it had no national enforcement or judicial branch, so it often relied on reluctant state authorities to enforce its laws.
It had no power to revise tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The amendment of the constitution required the unanimous consent of all states, but the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives often absented themselves from the meetings.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, behind the German national team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, volleyball and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"Due to the concentration/clustering of islands, Japan is often called an 'island group' geographically".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name - Ilha Formosa - meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed the indigenous grain-producing methods, and employed Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of western Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, granting sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main parts, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
For example, the most common still format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size in the twilight of the analogue film era.
It's still in production today, but the important thing is that it's been scaled up to the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format actually, somewhat confusingly, means 36 m wide and 24 mm high.
The page ratio of this format (after dividing by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) can now be set to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in a picture.
He claims that the most effective place for the main theme is to cut the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under siege.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
His far-reaching power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised the question of whether its basic teaching was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in sealing off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated the general international law enshrined in several international agreements over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire oceanic territories, endangering even neutral ships.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to the unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of citizens and nations.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of war through World War I, nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job in New York City with the Edison Company.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing but a book of poems and a letter of recommendation addressed to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor, his former boss.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods: each era and each ruling family in China's history was a distinctive dynasty.
The dynasties experienced a period of uncertainty over the division of their provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles fighting for the throne fought fiercely against each other.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people died in a battle for the top seat in the Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political implications of the ten-point system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and a belief in the country of the people and not of an independent ruler.
After the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to excel.
The same is true of the military, because instead of rank being determined by class, it is now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed working class members in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the worldly life, and he regularly went to a cave on the "Noor" (light) mountain, which became known as the "Hira" as a place of meditation".
It's the cave itself that has stood the test of time and gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
A cave on top of a mountain north of Mecca is completely isolated from the outside world.
And even if one knew it existed, it would be difficult to find it.
Nothing is seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, a world that is barely visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built in honor of dead Pharaohs.
"The Giza plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest of these), as well as several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid of Khufu, along with several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples, were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward  sign is V-shaped, and the downward  sign looks like a pin or a square with no bottom.
Up means you start at the top and press the bow, down means you start at the frog (where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
"The 'up' pull usually gives a softer sound, while the 'down' pull is stronger and more definite".
Feel free to mark your notes with a pencil, but remember that printed dashes are there for musical purposes and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market-goers forced Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, back to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows completely.
Suddenly, in the face of the frightened queen, a member of the crowd shook the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
To cover most of the costs, they had to pay taxes to the American colonial government, and the bonds were floated to Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits came from the prolonged exploitation of the people of the Philippines, which constituted the basic profit of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the Order.
The era of events is generally called the Late Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism in practice contains a wide range of ideas, the urge for technology or technological necessity strictly implies that human fate is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond a cultural or political influence, and that on the other hand technology has an 'impact' on societies, and these effects are co-occurring rather than socially conditioned".
For example, there is an opinion that the automobile necessarily leads to the improvement of roads.
However, the countrywide road network is not economically viable with few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
At the same time, mass car ownership also leads to high road accident rates, which encourages the invention of new techniques in health care to heal injured bodies.
Much of the Romanticism was influenced by cultural determinism and drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures linked to a given geographic location developed that, when aligned with the community's location, proved superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the world at the time, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders rejected suspicious gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that Paris won the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The heyday of the Gothic style lasted from the 10th to the 11th century.
The clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine, Eastern culture.
However, due to slow communication methods, styles may have been 25 to 30 years behind in the West.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style, and one of the biggest developments that came about as a result of the Crusades was that people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming only to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds and a crop rotation or other relatively simple technique common in the ecoregion to maximize yield.
Throughout history, most farmers have been self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow for the development of self-esteem.
Subcultures can be characterised by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership with a recognizable symbolism style, which includes fashion, behavior patterns, and the use of slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the examples of some unfortunate children who, because of neglect, bad luck, or premeditated abuse, were not able to socialize with adults as they grew up.
Some wild children were separated by humans (often their own parents) in cases where the abandonment of the child was a parental rejection due to the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
The children who were abused or traumatized may have been severely abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or fled.
Others were said to have been raised among animals; some were said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by completely nonhuman animals, a child in the wild, under physical restraint, almost completely adopts the behavior patterns of the animal caretaker, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports people who are taking part in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
"The scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but the little gem-tipped person in Microsoft Office is also a scaffolding".
The virtual scaffolding is built into the software to question, persuade and explain the procedures that would have challenged the learner to do the task on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
A child should never be allowed to grow up without a nurturing, caring, and nurturing environment, but it does happen.
We consider foster care a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and a reliable health care system.
The orphanages must provide all the necessities that are missing from the previous home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in terms of the use and satisfaction model.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal participation"" and "continuous relationships"" were also new motivational considerations in Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study, which focused on audience responses to Internet sites".
Using video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-facial expressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
Especially when it is claimed that some people can correctly tell when someone is lying from certain facial expressions.
In his essay on the presidential speech, Oliver Sacks noted that people with brain damage who cannot interpret speech have a very accurate sense of honesty.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior is found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that genetic variation has two variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation provides the opportunity for new genetic variation, which selection removes from the set of expressed variation.
A mixture of segregation and recombination, the back and forth variation between the two money supply in each generation.
Out in the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
What is more, there are serious consequences if this is not done: growth depression, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and tubers, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (moths, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it wouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the protein problem in the same way that today's chimpanzees do in the savannah.
Interruption is the intentional awakening from a normal sleep cycle and the process of falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring the state of alertness without completely waking you up.
If you are sleeping, set the clock on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, a well-known urine driver) before sleep, which forces a person to urinate at night.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is in contrast with the degree of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and every person has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and only our own tension and negativity can prevent us from achieving that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga origin.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it's a path of Kundalini yoga, meditation and all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening Kundalini energy through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central theme of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, where by visualizing many deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and self-awareness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
For the next 40 years, proxy armies fought in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defences had broken down and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize through the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were declared obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that the country is able to move people and goods while impeding the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to cross the Atlantic with men and supplies to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well, as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for their easily available milk supply, as well as their fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that migrated on hills or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent goat herders, similar to the more widely known herders.
Tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were made of only parallel poles, they allowed horses to pull faster and with greater weight than the relatively few curved roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used quickly enough to keep the track in place, but they soon realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.
This became a daily practice, but the iron made better use of the wooden wheels of the carriage.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking on two legs around the same time as Homo erectus two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, were not normally upright.
The bipedal species are found in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce some of the suffering of the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we want to do more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has been greatly changed by mankind's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of mankind.
After its introduction to Congress on July 4, the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary of State, Charles Thomson, sent a manuscript draft to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made of what are now called Dunlap prints.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunpage page, still extant, is the oldest surviving copy of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and that is birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Birds still look a lot like dinosaurs.
They have spiky, clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually every computer we use today is based on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits or bits in computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The most certain sign of internal poisoning is an open container for medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for the poison.
The term "beetle" is used in an official sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are highly adapted insects that parasitize humans.
Bed bugs and bed bugs are also nesting beetles, meaning that they are suitable for nesting or for use in the household.
In the United States, about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may even decide that it is not in their best interests or that of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide to make an adoption plan for their baby
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights to another couple to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works using scientific methods.
But it's not just that. An experiment, and an experiment is a test that's used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to observe, which also helps in scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
In physiology and human behaviour, many of the actual rhythms are in most cases significantly dependent on the occurrence and production of endogenous cycles during the biological cycle.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have periodic rhythms that are not merely reactions to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that cycles freely even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence for the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were performed in which the DNA of the mosquito was marked with radioactive phosphorus or the mosquito protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in and enjoy the natural sites, including the flora and fauna.
On-site programmes include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing, and getting to know the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplaces and pass by people whose workplaces are in the same place they just left.
In this dynamic, mobile transport, everyone is somehow connected to everyone else and supports a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that this massive release of carbon dioxide has severed the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed lands, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail every day?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus, traffic processes generally have reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, three main characteristics were linked: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links will help in the design, construction and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along their body.
This gives them more room to hide from predators.
Today, only the sternal fins and the hindwings of the beggar can't fold.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the earth spinning, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, and its water supply is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide at points.
20 percent of the river water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and superiority of the Giza pyramids.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their ancestors, which were well over a millennium old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most public servants, while Latin is used mostly for religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew of such basic chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper in ancient times because they were all found in nature as raw materials and could be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, thought that all four elements were composed of a mixture of one or more elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought that these would become new materials that we can see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Calcium, potassium and other elements are considered metals, but of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there could be trillions of them at the end of a sentence.
So when the pencil came along, it served many people well.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods developed, the pencil was downgraded and used less.
People today are texting on their computer screens and never getting near a mountain.
We can only guess what the keyboard will look like when they come up with something new.
The fission bomb works on the principle that the impact of the nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's like driving a heavy truck up a mountain, and the fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they sometimes split with little impact or even by themselves.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner below the tidal areas and thicker below the plains.
There could be more black rock nearby because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what excites their interest.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories explore what makes certain people want the things they do and what in their environment makes them do or not do those things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors can develop when leaders start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is when they try to be the only one for the guys".
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering disciplinary procedures, performing performance reviews, defining responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that everything the group creates needs to be changed and made their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often creates conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
The performance of virtual teams is measured by the same criteria as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons for the direct physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique characteristic of the virtual team.
"The invisible team is the leadership team to which the members report.
Why would an organisation go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learner organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be brought to the surface.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome barriers results in a new innovative process within the organisation to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organizations achieve greater performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, so it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the observations of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and even cause changes in certain mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe brain structures and processes never before seen.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material that can be used to build simulation models to understand what's going on in our minds.
Despite its strong science fiction value, AI is actually a very important branch of computing that deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research into artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
These include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it is embedded in many home computer and video game software.
Class trips are a big part of every classroom, and teachers often and willingly take their students to places where bus trips are not possible.
Technology allows for virtual excursions, where students can see museum art, visit an aquarium, or admire any artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the experience of a class trip with others virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at North Carolina's Bennet School create a website every year about their visit to the state capital, and the website is updated every year, but as a memoir, they also keep the old versions online in a form that is accessible.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the appearance of the audience usually changes that.
Since the most critical audience is often drawn from the audience, the blogger considers developing writing skills to be key to avoiding criticism.
At the same time, blogging  forces students to better understand the world around them. Maintaining an audience's interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to significantly extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs  can prepare students to become more analytical and critical; active response to Internet material can help students to define their own positions on other people's writing  and their own viewpoints on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, and it has many art galleries and museums that tell us about Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north, the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka.
These, along with many other things, make Ontario look like a true Canadian to outsiders.
Farther north, vast, sparsely populated areas and sometimes almost uninhabited wilderness are found.
A demographic that may surprise many: More African Americans live in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are famous for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam with them and it spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel and the western and southern parts by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travellers are advised to identify themselves as married, regardless of marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to things that they can view as harassment, and it's not uncommon for them to be followed, to be held by their arms, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to stand up to them (cultural differences, no matter what!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the city as a strategic port.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be abandoned in 1755 by an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan Daru l-Badya rebuilt the city, and the Spanish traders named it Casablanca and established their trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
It is easy to find places around the old medina selling traditional Moroccan products such as teaspoons, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and all kinds of candies, but here everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province should be informed before visiting outside Goma.
The city is the starting point for climbing Nyragongo Volcano and is one of the cheapest places in Africa to watch mountain gorillas.
Transportation within Goma is by boda-boda (motor taxi).
It is associated with its relative isolation and is used as a metaphor for the exotic, remote regions of Timbuktu.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it is famous for its tourist attractions and airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 because of the threatening desert sands.
This was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS series The Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has an Arab atmosphere rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each home to a different species.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is the flagship of the Republic of South Africa's national parks.
As in all South African national parks, there is a conservation fee and an entrance fee.
"You may also find it useful to purchase a 'Wild Card' which will give you access to either selected South African parks or all South African national parks".
Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and it is a place of interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that form the silhouette of Hong Kong resembles a glittering column diagram, made even more striking by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The urban area of Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site occupied by the English colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove belt, stretching 50 miles from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are also home to some of the last towers of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run all day from the regional bus station (across the river), but most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have small, comfortable, high-capacity Japanese shore buses.
A one-way taxi is a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.5 meter wide lanes.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs clearance points are estimated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Indian Province", was created in the 16th century by a meeting between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial phase that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest race of the year will be in December at the Las Cañitas Racecourse.
At other times of the year, you can also watch less prestigious competitions and matches here.
For news on leagues and tickets to T-shirt matches, please visit the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands that can exchange money is the one in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and surrounding areas, and Stanley bank cards and U.S. dollars are often available.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted in more remote islands, although British and American currencies may still be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make you feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to meeting humans, the wildlife is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority says to keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife.
As docile as they may seem, buffalo, vaquita, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so they need to be allowed to move around.
Also, it is important to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful not to cook or bring intense scented food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British warship was sunk, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the Mau movement's independence struggle, Grand Chief Lealofi III of Tupua Tamasese was killed during a peaceful gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is connected by two harbours, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific coast and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all sandy beaches are safe to swim in, and most provide shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at the Waitemata Harbour in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with many shops lining the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'".
There's plenty of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
The concept of 'flat white' is unfamiliar to Australians, with the short black being called 'espresso', the cap having a lot of creamer (not foam) and the tea being served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the juices are expensive, but they're of the highest quality.
Many visitors come to the reef year-round, and injuries are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, follow the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the cuckoo has been seen near beaches and river mouths between October and April, and occasionally elsewhere during these times.
Sharks do happen, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have individual offers with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined air and accommodation packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a significant majority of attendees choose to camp on site, in fact, most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you should arrive early to get to a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the concert on the main stage has ended, there may be areas of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, watch the position of your cabin, as ice can be extremely noisy for those who are too close.
The tourist information is available on the website of the Ministry of Tourism and Tourism.
Casinos generally make numerous efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and in the room.
While alcohol is served at the house, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
All drivers at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or below freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive on them as you would on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, as much snow can fall as a traffic jam in a very short time.
The visibility may be limited by snowfall or snow blowing, steam impact or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic is uninterrupted year-round.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and provide a unique experience for visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to land trips to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close to cars and are easily observed with ordinary equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better with binoculars.
Walking safaris (also called hiking, hiking, or hiking) consist of a few hours or days of hiking.
The 2021 Summer Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics after hosting the 1964 games.
If you booked your flight and boarding in 2020 before the delay was announced, you could find yourself in a strange situation.
The cancellation conditions vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation conditions do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that event tickets will generally cost between ¥2500 and ¥130 000, with tickets typically priced around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes helps dry them, and in many hotels you can find irons and ironers that you can use even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don't have an iron or don't like wearing iron socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Care should be taken not to allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scalding).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes longer.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you are concerned, consider buying water bottled from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they may not have encountered before in their homes.
Pests can spoil food, irritate, or worse, cause allergic reactions and spread poison or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free purchases are purchases of goods at certain locations free of taxes and levies.
Travellers to countries with high tax burdens can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging driving area on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, which often runs through isolated, backwater areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open for steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than those in the previous and subsequent sections  generally 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is of paramount importance.
Interestingly, though, the signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery is very good, and in Bavaria it is made quite richly and variedly, similar to its southern neighbours, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked year-round, and cherries and plums are baked in summer.
Many German baked goods, however, contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts.
If you want some small but lavish cakes, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a herbal and spice-based food made with meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be either 'dry' or 'sou' depending on how much liquid it contains".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is often used, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used to make curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a huge variety of cuisines in the country's various landscapes.
However, when used without other qualification, the term most commonly refers to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The cuisine of Java, which is widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the flavours of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially coconut) and various aromatic spices dominating the cuisine.
The rider's legs are held up by hinges on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but their use raises safety concerns because the rider's foot may become stuck.
If the horse throws the rider but his leg gets caught in the handle, the horse may pull him away if you cut him off.
First, most competitors wear smooth, narrow-toed riding boots with corners.
Then, some saddles, especially the English saddle, are fitted with safety bars that allow the saddle to fall off if the rider pulls it back while falling.
The Cochamó Valley is a prominent Chilean mountaineering destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its various large granite walls and fissures.
From the tops of the mountains, a breathtaking view is offered, as climbers from all over the world continually create new routes on the walls of endless possibilities.
Sliding snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, including snow-covered skiing with a ski-slide or foot-mounted snowboard.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, sometimes called ski lovers, who plan entire vacations around skiing in one place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to as early as 5000 B.C.E.
The origins of skating as a sport date back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking: also known as backcountry skiing, hiking or skiing.
It is associated with but not usually associated with alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and with much tighter skis and boots.
Interpret a ski run as if it were a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover a longer distance than you can on foot - but you rarely reach ski speed without a heavy backpack on the groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and normally, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you generally do not need to pass through any other passport control points when crossing the border.
Similarly, a Schengen visa does not require you to change visas in each Schengen Member State, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of what is considered an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as being over 100 years old.
The definition varies from place to place, and in some places this age limit is shorter than in Europe, such as North America.
Craft products could be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar products produced in series.
Reindeer herding was - and still is - an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the business was important to many people in other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mostly as herding animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami town of Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word gypsy is often considered offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate judgments about Roma people.
If the country you wish to visit is the subject of a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can also seek advice from other governments, but these governments have tailored their advice to their own citizens.
For example, Middle Eastern Americans may be treated differently by Europeans and Arabs.
The briefings are merely brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often brief, general and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a catch-all term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or even death.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and has several types, depending on geography, topography, and environmental conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall and wildfires are the manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, together with storms, tornadoes, tidal waves and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the severe weather risks in the area as these may affect their travel plans.
If you are planning to visit a war zone, you should have some professional training.
If you search the Internet for the words "Hostile Environment Course", you'll probably get an address for a local company.
The course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, in most cases combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts two to five days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Passengers planning non-conversion surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The attitude of different governments varies as to whether they will issue a passport with an "no" marked (X) or a document that includes the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is just as variable.

Returning currents are returning currents of waves that break away from the shore, often at a reef or similar.
Underwater topology causes the return current to condense at some deeper sections, and a rapid flow can form in the deep water there.

Once out of the flow, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than it was at first.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be swept away by the current again, or - depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted - it's worth waiting for rescue.
