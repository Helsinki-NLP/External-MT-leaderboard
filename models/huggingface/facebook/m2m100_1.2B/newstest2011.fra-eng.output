CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastries in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the capital’s mayoral will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to the CSSD, namely, whether they know the argument that was born in recent years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who ruled in Prague.
The encoded vocabulary that Prague’s political creme launched during the previous era of mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was surprisingly that it was discovered that the newly elected do not understand the well-known terms.
At least they say so.
“Who is Valdemort?”
“I really don’t know.”
“I am a young man in Prague politics,” reacted Lukas Kaucky, the culture-elect at the test of the vocabulary of the “parent.”
And as for the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of “golf hole”.
“It’s the only expression I use.”
Otherwise, I will not use the argument.
From the vocabulary, whose expressions the daily Aktualne.cz published in June of this year before the ODS pre-electoral congress, the editorial board selected 6 examples, in priority those related to the Prague City Hall.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the bakery, "beef nerve", "treason of the capital" and "entol".
Three of the elected voters agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who should lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek rejected the test.
"I don't care at all about these things there and how the representatives of civil democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
“I’m currently working on how we’re going to understand each other as part of our programs,” he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the legend above, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only phrase he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
“It’s the Blanka tunnel,” says Kaucky and immediately adds, “but I know it from the newspapers.”
“I’m going to have to pay for a language class,” he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the sense of "going to the bakery."
"I think it's about going into a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no lexic of argument in social democracy.
“I consulted with colleagues and it seems we don’t really have something like that.”
“We say the names instead, sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza in school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that way,” Karel Brezina confesses about the nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the less friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that social-democrats admit to use within the party.
It is said that Hulinsky does not like much to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in matraque law" reminds it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor in law JUDr. at the police academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches," a brochure was published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are part of the older generation, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man rarely has such a destiny.”
"Neither do we judge healthy young women because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who works in the capital of this western African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual “social measure.”
He published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
This is a “hic”.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," the newspaper Die Standard warned of the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they sprayed to her.
It was the BBC server who transmitted this information.
Criminals say it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings became inflamed by the woman's contact.
The oil broke out, it appears, when the team wanted to “destroy the evil spirit” of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: “Human mind-eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is striving to reduce witch hunting, Gambia not later than last year even saw the President himself participate in it.
“Gambia’s President Dzammi, after his aunt’s death, launched a widespread hunt for witches who appeared to have participated in his death and had attempted by black magic to kill the President as well.”
"Shamans from nearby Guinea who came to rescue brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, randomly chosen men and women from villages in Gambia," Amnesty International said in a message.
In the farm, prisoners were forced to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The cupcakes warm up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out from the door of the customer center of the RPG company Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s.
The deregulation increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second class apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," the man who has the signature power shows his finger on his son's new contract.
“But I signed it anyway,” he explained in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz who described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent" advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published explaining the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
“One says this, the other says something else” by flanking the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Just next to the door stands a guard from a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, “lease 2011”, is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number is already starting to shine on the big screen under the waiting room topit.
In a fraction of a second, it’s your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rent doesn’t seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems as everywhere – requests for repairs, insurance-related events and more.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have received mail with the new lease agreements in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rental increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special store for new rentals has been open to the public since November 18.
“It has been working for almost a week, so it’s still being tested,” the employee behind the counter replies, after a moment of hesitation, when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The demolition and former miners’ apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local topic.
The Vice-President of Parliament and from the Ostrava region, Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats, this quite firmly before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
“20 years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a piece of board in the toilet, the man mentioned in the introduction relieves himself.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new rental price if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is half the amount of the rent that will be paid to the other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" checkpoint on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," the employee said.
And yet RPG targets both on its website and in the vitrines of individual interviews on rents when needed.
If the two parties do not agree on the lease, an independent court will decide.
"It's not about threats, it's just about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," RPG said on its website.
“Here nobody goes to court,” one of the RPG employees of Byty thinks, and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives her the right.
"I have 13,000 crowns in retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
“We will see.”
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait," she said.
Rental regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," reminds Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the rental increase.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rent to invest in the apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging on the ceiling in front of the covered chairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The rental increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 3,1200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG added.
Next year, the rental will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rental increase (cf. the chart) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rental increase have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also be home to a mini kindergarten with everything you need – colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch. design employees can visit.
Architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, imagined its mini business school from the first layouts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs around 90 people, mostly from childhood and cared that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
Along with part-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine taking work with caring for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design. themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The school is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding appropriations (up to 2.8 million CZK), they were able to purchase equipment and devices and after two years to provide qualified personnel as well as the launch.
After the use of the funding grant (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the grant application.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a nursery teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limit but they have more than three anspore most.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although this is individual care and education, the mini-pre-school program is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not only play there, but a quality education is also guaranteed - from the beginning to the preparation for school banks, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of a delay to go pick up the children in a school away from the parents’ workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are family-friendly and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. take a look into the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase with a dinosaur spine and the balconies with open fish mouths.
This is the case of the Casa Battlo in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic shapes, the house has received from the locals the nickname of House in bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, façade reminiscent of scales and everywhere curves, these are all the things that are typical for Antoni Gaudi’s Art Nouveau.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The wrapping and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyeliner and the lamelles.
The house Battlo that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of another entirely new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-housing house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representative of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the façade were born.
Other artists and creators have also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the plans for the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
Locals nicknamed the hot house just after its finishing because of its organic shapes "The House of Bones".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it "the house that bails".
It is said that on the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of St. George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought of the house as a unique system in its time of central heating, with typical windshields and fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permission to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the city council was horrified and requested changes.
It didn’t like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the building pillars stumbled onto the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) the authorization to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third one room and a private part of the apartment.
The floor was rented to a jewellery.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which access to an independent roof terrace.
All straight angles and straight lines were canceled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction has received in addition to new façades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with light wells.
The two-color game gives maximum light to all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark that, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The house Casa Battlo, which was listed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous creator's birth.
They continued the visits as they found it to be a lucrative business and expanded the scope of visits to the common areas and the loft including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really inexpensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The amount is still above the entrance price to Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you need to quickly find a companion among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a somer: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatory frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so the mattress and the sommier provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the selection several things are determining,:weight, height, age, health status as well as the gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and summary will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where you don’t sleep continuously, latex mattresses are not suitable because they “warm up” slowly.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be returned frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels at the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture.
Habit is also crucial in choosing.
Anyone who spends the light of the day abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a rammish layer will hardly feel well on a low, hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a rammeling layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system that therefore misappropriates "information" from joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in coated furniture.
This is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hockeyists as well as other customers.
“Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have suitable mattresses.
You don’t need to be a NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pressures you and you won’t turn overnight like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also acts as a protection against scratches.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, single beds for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient when visiting.
'H, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Breeders-Dressers and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own mattress and mattress, so be careful, however, when buying to choose the mattress height well.
Otherwise, you will only have to mount the summier at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of mattress.
The bedwoman, when the mattress and the bedwoman are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very badly airy; we should not wash them, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night you normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and clogged) tamis.
For this reason, experts refuse to claim a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime guarantee.
Everything on its own.
And for this an experienced advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the mattress coating, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to make coatings with sliding closure for the whole set, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when you remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a summier?
and never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night.
However, equip the board (if there is no one) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachets (German Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position lamel mattresses with 14/18 lamels, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (per the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamels, 28 and above, where the lamels are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and that it is thus possible to regulate its rigidity.
For mattresses with multiple positions, you should not take a rope mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the lamels, we can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special bonding of the lamellas that allows to press or even tilt the lamella so that the sleeper's shoulder "integrates" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as the back,” this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "male" have begun to use a rolling area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again give them a softer surface on the hips.
For the most difficult client, there are wing or platelets with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and diminishes the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen air) on good mattresses and summier, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians prefer by example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should upgrade the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder crib or the rammollie area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first on the basis of straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in the bio mattresses.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of bush plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, it "coolens" the man, the coatings "warms" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 kronor and more.
Those that are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it was Gumotex that reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and the summier is not easy.
From time to time, in the context of special actions by manufacturers or producers, two mattresses can be purchased for the price of one.
For example, the company Magniflex, which offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam Memory sewing to the coating for 11990 kr.
The second one can be taken for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a large thickness began with Tempur matter at a "cosmic" pace.
This started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were undergoing enormous launch load factors.
The tempur rattles with heat and hardens, on the contrary, with cold.
It thus adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimum pressure to it.
It is therefore ideal against poor sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot pillows that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear of their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up in the beginning to search for cars can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases, such as the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a pencil box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage, but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the tracking devices suppliers in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in a person's bag who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know what the "box" is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
"And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control."
"Mobile phones, which can cut off like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will do everything to ensure that the child does not have electronic devices that can locate him."
“This is the phone.”
“As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (criminals) will search for them as well because the sale will be supported by a advertising campaign.”
“In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
She acknowledges, however, that such devices can help in the event of an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device can be configured so that it is in regular emission after a specified period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself lying down without moving,” says Cech.
According to him, the so-called smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special prologue.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it’s either a device similar to those we’re wearing depending on the size of a pencil box or to the smaller phone devices.
You can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that’s why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like ordinary digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendulum, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could go around the Czech Republic with.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
As of last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifetime of the ropes is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating ropes from the company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave the reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating ropes to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserves calculations made by the army pyrotechnicians, who MF DNES contacted, it turns out that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive exercise each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defense, and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army, are no exception.
Just to argue the military’s annual consumption of 60 km of detonating ropes.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the reserves of the army could survive for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, more than 2 meters of detonating ropes are sufficient, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has secured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the mentioned 225 years.
However, soldiers from the Rapid Intervention Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their wrestling weapons and that shooting sessions are limited due to money needs.
The lack of clothes is not mentioned.
"And I don't mind if they buy such a large amount of detonating ropes from us."
“And it’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us, the military is a good customer that we strive as merchants to satisfy,” says STV Group Commercial Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argued the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of detonating ropes by the fact that the military will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports that detonating ropes only last four years and police and military pyrotechnicians only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the deposits, it can even go up to four years," says one of the two who does not want his name to be published given the criticism of the military.
The lifetime passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said Pejsek, a spokesman for the defense ministry.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of detonating ropes by the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amounts of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and in addition to being able to obtain more flexibly more modern and reliable types of detonating ropes.
The Ministry of Defense has today major problems with the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact time when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to move toward the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating ropes that it buys today "cheaply".
So far I’m taking advantage of the contacts I’ve gained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur contest.
The winner of the contest for Best Individual Entrepreneur last year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small 5 apartment building half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a third-year high school student, it was a courageous action.
“The ratio between quality and price of accommodation in our area made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profits in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, there was another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise appeared," the number one entrepreneur last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Contest of the Entrepreneur of the Year has served well," adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I have to say, it was very pleasant,” he recalls.
He recommends participating in this competition to anyone who tries to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained otherwise.
“With those I met through the competition, I started to have regular business relationships.
According to him, the reputation linked to success also had an impact on employees.
There are about 70.
“I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized.”
“It’s not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of us all together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal sense of the winning Farmet has the worst moments behind.
The one who came to pick up the prize at Slovansky dum for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky, the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of SEK 100 million.
“I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but also my employees and increased our confidence in fighting against the competition,” said the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even to the non-specialized public after the success obtained at the contest through the media.
“Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also foreign partners who began to realize that they were working with a company that achieved the greatest success in their home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not happen in Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company’s assessment was based on the financial results of 2008 and in part of 2009.
2009 was the hardest year for engineering machinery sales.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
“Of course we have not escaped this situation.”
“The turnover dropped 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even fire,” explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and retained beneficial results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
"We have built a training and research center with the resources, strengthened the company's presentation at international exhibitions and won major awards at national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
Everything leaves us thinking that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers are rising, and with them the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes nonsensical regulations.
The Survey on the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been removed.
The little glorious winner of this year’s Survey on the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring into the offices documents that officials can get online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the Social Affairs Administration requested a paper excerpt from the Commercial Register while the official can get it in two mouse clicks.
This changes with the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the trade register extract for insurance payment checks," Jana Buranova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ), said.
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this Contest of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If 3,000 voters took part last year, at least 4,000 voted this year.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only brake the company, and,this, more and more.
"We may be in the number of documents to fill in for the world's top tax returns," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for the company, which is 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first set up in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities each year from April to the end of September, the last time before the competition closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for the "antiprize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurd who received the most votes is declared winner.
Until the last survey last year, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by trade unions and teachers.
Among the “finalists” of the competition, therefore, among the nominees is for example the obligation that vehicles for the maintenance of highways and highways pay the toll, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees repair two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the contest, which always starts at the beginning of November on the Venceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening regularly attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
“Economic prosperity can’t work when the state puts asses in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Act on Individual Enterprise.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is fine until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
This year’s novelty of the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been around for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The aim of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the company contest of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, registered companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this concerns people with disabilities and personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic is the Prague prologue company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo which has been the main contributor to the fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
In addition to taking care of employees with health problems, we can also mention the old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 percent of them and which, for this, won the title of the firm Responsible for the Central Bohemian region and ranked third in the region in the competition of the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it was MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won by introducing eased working hours and even reduced to 35 hours a week on average and, this, without, proportionally, a decrease in salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prioritizes purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports business in her neighborhood and cares about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," said Miluse Ryznarova, the company's chief executive officer.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for them for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The Man in the Shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
At the very last place is, also for its activities, a laundry and cleaning company from the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonus above standards.
“In our society, we contribute to food, transportation, skills and leisure,” says Joseph Strapac of Bruntal Czasch’s construction company, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Company of the Year contest were automatically registered in the Responsible company category, who had answered the questionnaires attached to the registration document and returned it to the organizer before 15 August.
False or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were removed from the contest.
“If the representatives of the firms in the competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the competition “principal” the company of the year of Vodaphone.”
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a subcategory of the main Contest of the Firm of the Year," said Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police carried out arrests during a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, anti-corruption police have carried out arrests in recent days.
Detectives passed the gloves to the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos.
The latter sought to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a restitution request in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offence of initiation as part of a tender and public competition," said Antonie Zelena, the head of the Prosecutor's Office of Plzen, told the newspaper Pravo, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations as the investigation is underway.
Police released the 46-year-old man after 24 hours.
To know how he could influence a public tender, one can only speculate given so little official information.
At a question from Pravo, Lubomira Cerna, a spokeswoman for the Land Fund, said that police officers had actually carried out an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
“It was a client and in no case an employee,” she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Law on Land" and is set up when several candidates who are entitled to the right appear.
“These persons offer, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to reimbursement that must be settled before the value of the land is announced.”
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," the spokesman of the Fund explained.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had signed up for the call and as he himself is also a beneficiary person because having purchased a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the contest.
Probably because of his withdrawal.
That would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts far above standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terres).
He appeared in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The municipality was forced to accept because otherwise it would endanger the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an extra one hundred crowns per month for the housing.
From January, households will have to pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw from their wallets up to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas almost 2 percent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to bring near-apartment households 100 crowns annually more than currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices due to the sensitive development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energy, photovoltaic cells.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
In addition, a hundred crowns can be added.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to raise prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, Libérec families will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, a 9 percent increase is being prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rents do not change, the Prague residents will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
Prices in Prague will still be some of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 percent.
Rental prices will rise significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments in rent from January, that is, at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rental increase will be brought to court by the company.
The regulated rent paid by people in 300,000 apartments could rise next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children are drunk with rum and fernet.Beer is no longer fashionable and acts gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for relapse are no exception.
This is a result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of children’s departments of hospitals.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to get drunk.”
“The trend is really to strong alcohols,” says Ludek Pelikan, head of the children’s department at the Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
“When they manage to chipple a bottle to Daddy in the closet, it’s sometimes about whisky but it’s fernet and vodka that prevail.”
"Wodka has that advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, is also right.
“It’s usually rum or fernet.”
“Alcohol is now fashionable, especially in elementary schools.”
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home," Jurinova added.
According to the head of department Pelikan, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced for ten years precisely in paediatrics where ambulances brought completely drunk schoolchildren from the broad surroundings.
She was hospitalized four times.
"She began her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood plus a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What is interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," said the department director surprised.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their unusual tolerance of their rejection of drinking that are the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to experts, however, we are not talking about dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
“Alcoholism refers to a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena resulting from it, but not found in children.”
“Among those who use acool repeatedly, this is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background,” explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, St. Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink despite bad results or they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course I lived on Witch's Day with the admission of seven drunk children at a time," Pelikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffers the next day of the "wood bite".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
“They are better off because they have a great evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them.”
"They're just amazed at where they're," says Pélikan, knowing that from time to time it ruins the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and intensive care bed hospitalization can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied this as a means of education by telling these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer on seasonal work to repay a single evening," Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive management, which should recover from parents the charges related to care, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Ministry of Defense has exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is headquartered.
This is the first time that such aircraft become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they were abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seat versions of the L-159T1 that were previously in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining Lestrois aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defense’s press department, the physical departure of the Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft planned for the exchange were taken on aircraft stored for a long time without causing any additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defense."
"The two-seat L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," Pejsek told Pravo.
He added that the army will not be left without biplaces since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 monoplaces into two biplaces.
The military took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery by the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
“In the contract it is clearly stated that the one taking the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the matter of the one who considers to determine how to this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for SEK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defense did not launch a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The defense leadership argued at the time that the exchange ensures future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has purchased 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
The European Commission has, however, filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The military has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the latter is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the index longer than the annular are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in the British journal Cancer.
This can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, for men under the age of 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo the prostate cancer test, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the anular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, they found the same likelihood of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before the age of 60 the risk decreased to 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two aforementioned fingers – formed during the prenatal period – indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow and the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and on the sidewalks, there is most of the time compact snow, shredders have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway was closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffered the same fate.
The Central Automobile Club (UAMK) dispatcher told the news
At the 91st kilometre a truck crashed, at the 93th two heavy-duty trucks collided, the accident injured people.
Several cars were also in the gap.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should leave directly after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometer at Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers was formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car rows are created, for example, in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trains are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff will meet again.
Railways and airports are also in trouble.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove seven high-speed connections due to the snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable, but are increasingly vigilant.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impractical, on the Brno road there starts to be some snowstorms and on the Blansko road chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, you may need to send snow demolitioners and strawberries.
We cannot for now estimate when they will be rollable.
On the Hodonin road caution is strict in the area of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, due to nature protection,ined only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesian region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow gradually disappeared in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has sent to Afghanistan a new “smart” weapon, known only under the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super precision gun.
Its projectiles are laser-guided with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at contact with the target but also at any point of its ballistic trajectory.
So you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
He is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel crashes falls on him, it can put him out of battle as well.
According to Richard Audette, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends a laser beam to determine the distance, thus obtains a precise targeting point, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the relaxation.
“Let’s say you targeted at 543 meters.”
"When you press the relief, the gun loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 jobs displaced
Fujitsu Group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will move their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg region.
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad Quarter.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs still spread across the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive.In addition, Astro Park’s open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a primary location for us with remarkable infrastructure.”
He says the connection to the airport is just of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday aroused the joy of winners and caused the disappointment of losers.
The head of economic affairs of the city of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a “planetary actor” had been thus conquered.
It is an “extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of settlement.”
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its deployment is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The municipality was promptly informed of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the computer manufacturer’s difficulties with the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now about preventing such an exceptional place from staying unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, used so far by the company Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings in Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall Hotel. This resulted in a lot of criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to be part of parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt Group specialized Real Estate-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu alongside the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is the world’s third largest provider of IT products.
For example, it puts computers and servers at the disposal of and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu has much more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name reminds of its star-shaped plan, is among other things home to the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Amazon threatens to expel Assange
WikiLeaks is facing increasing problems.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be hiding political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is currently living in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The cyber activist group Wikileaks has no longer access to its server hosted in the United States and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is being sought by Interpol, is most likely staying in Britain, according to reports published by newspapers.
WikiLeaks removed from Amazon’s server
“Freedom of expression in the country of freedom,” said on Wednesday (local time) the cyber activists at the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
A few days ago, Amazon removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists resorted to Amazon’s Web Service (AWS) to reach as much access as possible to the documents.
In a tweet, Wikileaks continued his revelations: “Forgivingly, our dollars are now being spent to take care of people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Liebermann's office, that Amazon banned WikiLeaks from using its servers following the investigation conducted by senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the site Amazon to orchestrate a boycott against it, the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish Amazon would have taken this step sooner given previous publications by WikiLeaks of classified information," he said.
Meanwhile, Liebermann urged other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
“Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and scrupulously, putting our national security at risk and life at risk around the world,” the senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks disseminate the content of the stolen documents.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list of people sought by Interpol.
According to information broadcast by the London newspaper "The Independant", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently described the prosecutions against him by Sweden as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been uttered against the site.
“There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange.”
That’s why Assange is concerned about his security, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the WikiLeaks revealers be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief Government Advisor Stephen Harper said on television, apparently ironically, that Assange should "be killed" and that Obama could "use a drone".
In the meantime, there has been controversy between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Mr Assange demanded Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs says.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government has now fully tested the protection of its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed responsible for fighting the leaks.
Mr. Travers is in charge of implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks.
The White House is also willing to check the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects intelligence.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if ever they are threatened by WikiLeaks revelations.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
University of Ice
Gelato University in Bologna prepares ice cream for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course organised for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Where did all the ice come from?
The ice and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outdated ice cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window with a spatula, places it in the wafer and then starts selling it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more about ice cannot avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams from its machines everywhere meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day introductory course organised for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extend over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are organized in the private glacier.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, an art education professor from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the future in the country of Industrial Ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and, after a few years, she wants to draw something unique from this nervous profession.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
It is not only good taste, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano poured the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees through an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a crane installed on the machine: out of it comes a pasteurized base white cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately attacked by the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of experimenting?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who only talks about ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only you have to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will crush nothing but ice granules.
Some changes to the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the smells.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
“The suppliers will all try to replenish you with dozens of flavored ingredients.”
“H, you should just try.”
Either in fruit sorbets recipes with sugar and fresh fruits.
It is in ice cream made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when adding cacao powder, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano occasionally invites them to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and nuts with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
Different types of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pures: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Nuts ice does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of nuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of a ice cream,” says Luciano.
Making ice is a calculation exercise: if you use fish pudding with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruits (the vineyards use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice cream no longer requires as much physical intervention as before.
It is not only the automatic mass making machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it ontuous and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, minor failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbs fruit purse from head to foot and thus scatters his classmates when the control of the colossal mixer bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident is likely to occur at every course: it is only a matter of time."
Employees in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nucleated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we got it right," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
Some reports indicate that the chairman of the EFSA Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively on the elaboration of EFSA’s test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The prescriptions drawn up correspond textually, by paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without transition.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relationships between the European Union supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not acknowledge any conflict of interest.
One opinion states that all reliable data is exploited, including industry data, as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from establishing contacts with this sector of activity.
They should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) based in the United States.
This body considers itself to be a neutral forum bringing together experts from, among others, the fields of science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding trials and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impacts of genetically modified corn cause on the field," says Mr. Then.
Current practice consists in testing only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not give reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how can you discover them?” asks Mr. Then in an accusing tone.
This is also the point of view of Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are hardly yet researchers who are not linked to societies.
According to the companies, critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says that “the industry controls safety research.”
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell gained a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing in front of Stuttgart station with her tube in the back.
There was Mani.
He was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators had arrived and had begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands of people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart’s central station into a underground station that will cost billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests resulted in the cessation of construction work.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the limestone shell) of Crailsheim, a gentle and rough pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He collected a few fragments.
These stones are relics.
“They should not disappear.”
He enthusiastically declares: “A modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly.”
He claiming that by cutting it in the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The footprints of Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office in a cottage, which was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September newspapers that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for full days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepipedes weighing an average of 80 kilograms worth between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardens, Private.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the safe and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of the grassplates.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” says Mr. Rongen.
“There was no political component.”
He enters his car all over the land, turning around his vast 20 hectare empire.
He studied law that he abandoned.Later, he undertook to study biology before later interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career professional.
An amateur of stones.
It contains 40,000 tons.
He gathered treasures all over Germany.
He is said to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He is refraining.
Sandstones carved with art are placed on the snow.
They used to be part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
“My favorite stone.”
He takes the path that rises through the forest.
It shows a bunch of finger: Red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
“The beautiful travertine.”
The parallelepiped was once part of the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the red granite from St. Blasien Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple slopes and chariots pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
“It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put to pieces.”
He did not become rich, much less rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people.In addition, stone carpenters, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycling company.
Soon he will go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Talent Struggle to Conquer High Potential
The countryside has a strong influence.
16 students rush to buy small salmon loaves, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and by the way, get to know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go body-to-body in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multi-faceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in the amphitheaters before the latter arrive on the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify outstanding talents as part of practical projects and trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group unveils the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares pens, sweets and cards featuring the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the paths to access the group’s premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: “Students come into contact with this industry sector and gain experience.”
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can know students, look closer at serious candidates and appreciate those who come into account as collaborators.”
According to Mr. Seele, such cooperation is unusual.
What’s new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
“In the past, the focus was on the professional project,” says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the acquisition of new graduates will become much harsher.
In sector properties, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a crowd of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, courtesy of highly qualified workforce.
It is mainly graduates from engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained unemployed in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, the vacancy related to engineering positions will grow further.
Roman Dykta goes on talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It hosts expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG’s subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The candidate to participate is decided in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the pursuit of high potential in universities are becoming increasingly important.
“We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race.”
“For us, a simple cruise was too little.”
For the talent hunter who is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
“Until now, we have been in contact with all the people who took part in a similar event last year.”
“Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon,” he says.
Apart from the direct amusement carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a quite classic way by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in professional fairs."
“For example, at the solar technology show,” says Sitha Stübe, human resources director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs approximately 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the problem related to the relief.
Currently, 35 jobs are being placed on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to find vacancies at the moment.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he said.
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or write his final study project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised by solar specialists.
That’s why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often, a large group can’t do that,” says Ms. Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played the primary role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a survey conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute constitutes an annual honorary table of German employers.
For this purpose, it asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
Staff Chief Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company’s image among job seekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments regarding a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy (DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as employers by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the industry, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer’s brand image within its own staff.
“Satisfied employees are the best messengers.”
When your employees are treated well and they identify with the company, they are advertising their employer to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Kriegler.
Obama to stop new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the southeastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government issued an equivalent ban and thus finally cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is currently prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The April explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform is the cause of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of the accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this business sector, said he was willing to authorize the construction of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution thus want to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating black tide in the golf field is not, so far, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing billions of dollars in claims for compensation, is at the center of the charges.
An investigation commission set up by Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze decreed after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and stricter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing profound reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced he would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil companies.
Actors in this sector are now publicly warning that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to the results of a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of the drilling ban issued on Wednesday.
By the way, the American Enery Alliance regrets the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: “No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, at the expense of growth.
Ogoni is dry.
The water that flows through the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to the one that exists at the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
People live from theft, corruption and the refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmental activist threw to reporters to calm them: "You still have enough oil mud before the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man sinking into muddy water to his chest, along with the fatty trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the glow of water in the color of the rainbow.
You can’t see that the basement is filled with brown oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that once she was collecting whole shrimp here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely settled.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil sprang out of a pipeline that exploded in the immense meltdown.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo now have to catch for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the devastation comes to the eye when travelling through the mangrove marshes crossing through rivers.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat breaks a crashing brown water. Anyone who plunges his hand in it removes the oil cover.
The small roots of the mangrove emerge from the soil like clay sticks.The isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang.
In vain, bird clouds are sought, as they are usually found in wetlands: As soon as the off-board engine stops, a ghostly silence falls upon this ancient paradise that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is war on the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sad appearance: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in terms of health."
Comparisons of wars are made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was later executed.
Even today, the return to the country of Ogoni is prohibited to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily through more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of oil pipelines across the entire Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the oil fields of the country of Ogoni are unused, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trellises like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are damaged by corrosion to the spotlight.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts’ estimates, more than two billion liters have spilled onto the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to the amount that was spilled into the sea during the crash of the super-oil tanker “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and pipeline syphoning are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider drilling head explosions and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner blamed the Shell group for applying in Nigeria essentially less stringent safety standards than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of failures in pipelines is “still much higher than ever.”
Some shapes emerge from mangroves to a place that, seen from a distance, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of cowboys and installed outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with cowboys to the neck.
A fire sparks under one of the many tubes that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a pattern on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tank for several hours, says team leader Michael.
At first, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the conduction, the kerosene drops fall and the diesel is eventually obtained.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $ 22.
Inhabitants of the Delta benefit from the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than the ridiculously low of just 40 cents per litre of diesel: Because they acquire their raw material for free.
According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million liters of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only an entirely insignificant portion of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, load the lion’s share in tankers and brand it onto the global market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies weren’t perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives weren’t so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no illegal theft and refineries.”
But, Meanwhile, the Ogoni relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only about the group's withdrawal. "maybe operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove better."
Michael becomes nervous.
“It’s time for you to get rid of it,” says the robust oil worker.
“Soldiers can appear at any time.”
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribery.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to take advantage, like all Nigerians, of the raw material.
“In all respects, this trick has dropped our country very low,” Akpori regrets.
Investigators Discover Construction Defects in A380 Reactors
The A380 has a serious security problem.
By examining a device that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
Qantas has filed a lawsuit against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had obviously had more luck so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it warns of a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue slopes and leaks in the oil pipeline connection, according to a position taken on Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a “catastrophic failure of the reactors.”
These are Rolls-Royce reactors equipped with 20 A380 aircraft.
The Quantas aircraft, which landed in Singapore on November 4, is among those.
The Australian airline has initiated legal proceedings against the British reactor manufacturer.
She has filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court headquartered in Sydney.This gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts separated and the carrying surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, the cause of the damage is oil inflammation.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors in the world must now be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all interested parties.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the airline Quantas had stationed its entire A380 fleet on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily halted three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the A380 reactor as a precautionary measure.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest aircraft in the world.
The falling snow has caused chaos in transportation.
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are stationary.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter rages Germany: Due to icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many locations.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the staff of the winter service worked permanently, but they were unable to get over the snow that continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent rains swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tide raids to take place off the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow clumps on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the weather alert station Meteomedia announced the violet alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
Even in the Saxony-Anhalt state, police officials have severe traffic disturbances.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and caused congestion.
In Thuringia, snowfall has hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutsche Bahn, serious rail traffic disruptions occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees dropped on railways, cataract or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, interregional transportation between Leipzig and Nuremberg was interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snow has caused numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some flight cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights have already been cancelled from Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers trapped at the airport, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on several roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level passage.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was struck at a level passage because the vehicle was stationary there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car crashed into a sliding road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will always be soft and dusty, but it will twist in the event of light rains.
The wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and fast winds.
It is very cold, at least 15 degrees in some places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank is seeking to separate itself from its emblem: According to reports by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The project could generate up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group’s headquarters: The twin towers located in the business district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is obviously seeking to recover the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The official did not disclose the reasons for the sale.
He said "we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and rent them again later."
This is how Germany’s largest financial institution has already given up its headquarters shortly afterwards.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the Twin Towers for 272 million Euros from owners.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have ingested, according to some indications, approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not known at the moment whether the properties will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourned for the children who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions that occurred in a mine.
The bodies were not yet able to be recovered because the safety situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a shining sun in Greymouth, south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surf boards, also took their place.
Flags were laid in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the commemorative feast that New Zealand had nourished the hope that the miners would rise to the surface.
“But they never went home.”
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pitches, said he can’t resign to accepting his son’s death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the families of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
South African and British miners also buried during the first November 19 explosion.
Rescuers have started extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Police prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre through his film, Walhalla Rising, an epic fighter.
Which audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when filming “Walhalla Rising”?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his bully and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When he is in a bad mood, he tears the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borne does not say a word about his real name.
Otherwise, we say nothing and celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that constitutes the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent traveling.
When a film targets multiple target groups, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the appearance of "Pusher", his trilogy about the fierce and full of style drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most art film fans must experience horror in the face of the brain spreading all around and into the intestines.
Action film lovers die of boredom when the borne embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity in calm and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to silence.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has found no film distributor in Germany and exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a heartbreaking film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It’s not about dialogue in this film, or coherent action, it’s all atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a movie.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives her a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts her throat with frozen images and a lukewarm soundtrack, but above all with an unfathomable hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the borne, preserves some innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything else, the hero whose moves are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, is an envoy of the devil himself.
It represents rottenness, but also, only for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, which aims at annoying, enthusiastic and astonishing.
It was a traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthquake work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, much less to submit to the agency’s controls.
In the night of September 5 to 6, 2007 about midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest nearby town is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, as it is about the reactor that Syria appears to have built with the help of North Korea in a stone parallel epiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well-suited to produce plutonium, which would allow for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
This technique has been in use since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video containing blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the inside of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, we have barely more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is thickening more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at al-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked about how he makes sure he deals with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer, saying that the IAEA had “sufficient documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians rushed to remove the debris of the "unused military building" and carried out a methodical plane of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received via a member state satellite images from commercial providers showing the moment that followed directly the attack; it seems that these are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, Israel, has acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret nuclear program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it unlikely.
Since then, Damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria did not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection at the site of al-Kibar and denied access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Even Israel remains silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation into this case has been ongoing since June 2008 without a result and has "growing into a serious problem of the agency's credibility", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna acknowledges, ultimately it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA believes that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have neither indicated which installations are concerned, nor what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that is very likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; this is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is an intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shipped between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "served for the production of fuel."
It would have "no indications regarding sensitive activities," such as uranium enrichment and re-processing; processes that are indispensable for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is unclear whether the carvings, which may hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of ground-loaded trucks disappear, no one will have information about where the gravats are stored.
According to the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined in 1998 the salt mine of al-Tibni, located only a few kilometers from al-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous Jane’s Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria undertook grounding work in the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help dispel suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months drawing up a plan for the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was intended to enable Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest the inspectors have in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not have been for this matter, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has been talking for months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means of which the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “an option to which I am open in the future,” but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "To this it would be useful, if in the end they find nothing."
Love in Time of War
Angelina Jolie made her debut as a director last summer.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing else is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian bully during the Yugoslav war.
The Bosnian women’s federations immediately protested.In response, some of the scheduled filming sequences in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress.
A few weeks ago, she offered these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they refused.
“The meeting must take place in Bosnia,” Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script tells a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic’s organization subsequently recommended the UN High Commissioner to withdraw Angelina Jolie’s status as a Goodwill Ambassador.
What kind of scenario has Jolie written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted after a few hesitations a filming permit in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not come later despite this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict.
However, it remains vague about the content.
It is quite different: The lovers knew each other long before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
That’s a big difference with the version “a rape victim falls in love with her murderer.”
That Jolie’s film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
From now on, only the Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let us shoot!
Everything is going well with the Irish.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team excessively dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream of joy against the backdrop of loud music, they kick their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in Southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into the opponent's beer cups.
The winner will receive 500 Euros plus an airplane ticket to attend the World Beer Pong Championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the frightening question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in his plans.In January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
“My home country is so far away and I have no job there.”
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the dark outlook in the country, two of Tanner’s three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, and his brother Colin now holds an IT consultancy position in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of the Tanner.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these predictions come true, it will be a current of emigration comparable to the one Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish great ease, sadness now takes the place.
The economic crisis, however, affects especially the well-trained young Irish, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there was money in excess.
Three out of ten people under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper abundantly publishes letters from readers written by young immigrants, who complain: “In Ireland, everything is going to the drift.”
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the possibility goes away and our country for a generation.”
“The last person to leave shuts off the light.”
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future as the government just throws dust in the eyes and offers no future prospect to young people.
“They’re cutting the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” said the 20-year-old.
She sees how her comrades shrink from one unpaid practical stage to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
“It’s a sad and depressing thought.”
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" trade fair that offers comprehensive support on the theme of "working abroad".
“But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new professionals to take their first steps in the professional hierarchy,” he said.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months Seán O’Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his homeland, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the loan contracted to build his home in his homeland.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he said, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore.”
He burst out of a laugh as he crosses through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive cars from major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O’Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for a sum of 380,000 Euros, 100 percent funded by the loan.
“These were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, drank hot tea and said, "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he said.
“Working for a while abroad isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe that’s what made us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after spending seven years there and in Ireland life was just going on."
This idea is liked by Cian Tanner.
Leaving the future and discovering how life happens elsewhere.
In his record, he already has a few years of work in London.That's why life in New Zealand shouldn't be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him in recent days: the party to be held on his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He feared it could not turn into a farewell.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said while drinking a long glass of beer.
“A goodbye, it sounds worrisome.”
“Let’s rather call it a goodbye evening, all relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprises.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has fallen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after experiencing a sharp drop in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Table 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with how their country’s democracy worked in practice; this figure is the same as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Around 34% said they had confidence in their country’s parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase from 2003 (respective 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shaken support for democracy.
If this lasted well during the global financial crisis, it is due to the fact that many countries in America have only experienced a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (cf. Graph 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a broadly shared sense of progress.
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
It is only the second time since the poll began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say they themselves or a loved one have been a victim of a criminal act in the past year; nevertheless, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree with this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year).
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A blatant vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the disastrous and scared country.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballot papers scattered across barracks, voting offices looted and intimidation.
The polling stations opened late at night.
Many Hattis, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and demanded the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have erupted across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior UN official in Haiti, described the event as “a fairly good election in many respects.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents owe it to René Préval, an impopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round and reached the second round.
With a cholera outbreak raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
Putting the feet to the center
The weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50 percent; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year could depend on Ms Fernández’s, apparently mourning, choice of whether or not she would abandon her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
In this regard, the signs remain confusing.
Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to drafting budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income on will.
Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into turmoil following Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president an even greater margin of manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and trade union salary claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, prioritized growth and poverty reduction, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Ms. Fernandez now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was boosted by the high global prices of Argentina’s agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Per this is why Ms. Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to the sanitation of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether Fernandez wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which kirchnerism is highly promoted.
When the Argentinians will be back from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have rebounded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
Half an hour to China
Taiwanese voters have oriented themselves towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its older brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of eligible voters, appeared on November 27 to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiment towards the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
She did the test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five municipalities, it failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned towards Taiwan’s full independence, won 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s voting share has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the major themes of Taiwanese elections, including tapping country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal costume.
A mysterious killing attempt has also been committed.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary Chairman of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot on the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passing person.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters toward the KMT.
Per the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates joined with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from raising anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is a response to a new awareness that Chinese are essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation to see if his policy with respect to China was acceptable for the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy that aims to deceive Taiwan, back to the cradle.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start with the beginning.
It’s better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was going badly: its former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to jail on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms. Tsai’s leadership and the PDP is doing its best to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a “trustworthy alternative” to Ma’s rushed approach to China.
Mr. Chen appears to be upset by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have obtained better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to make an introspection of itself.
Ma’s assessments were weak; despite a vertiginous economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said its cabinet and local antennas will be remodeled.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, “the point of no return has already passed.”
Grammy Awards Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the "Best New Artist" category
Perform on the request of a president, and people are required to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises at the Grammy Awards this year with a large-scale nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules according to which an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", has marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one pointed line to Spalding compared to Norah Jones's flashing success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "Instrumental Album" category, a turn on a revitalizing thrill of a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among them, “Moody 4B” by veteran saxophonist James Moody and “Positootly” by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, New Orleans’s racket voice favorite and frequent guest at HBO’s “Treme”, has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which is also strongly inclined towards a certain merger with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, has earned some well-deserved awards in the grand ensemble category; competing with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" from his octet's live was a beautiful example of this bassist's democratic hand as a band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
The top nominations include Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electrical orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman’s Madolin Concerto is also competing for a prize.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering recordings of orchestra, opera, choral and solo.
A category for the classic producer of the year stars five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album include Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Orchestra at Concertgebouw; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg from the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse from the Ars Lyrica Houston; "Love from afar" by Kaija Saariaho from the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin from the Orchestra and the Mariinsky Theatre Choir; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his instrumental solo performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he aviat wrote the 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of range and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Orchestra director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky’s works.
Among the instrumental soloists nominated are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only singer-solist nominations; here are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mix category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Racines: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project has been approved by the planning committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project, claiming it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center would comply with local laws and be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahá'ís, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, speaking Thursday morning.
“I am proud of this as an American citizen.”
“This shows that justice wins.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They have very strong voices.”
“We have good people in this valley.”
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people voting for or against the center, with speech time roughly equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Planned Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families co-exists without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot Mediterranean-style mosque would consist of two minarets and be 43 feet tall.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas Road about two miles east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
“This body has a double capacity.”
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That’s why it’s very special, even though it’s far from being a truly ‘foreign’ form of life,” commented Paul Davies C. W. of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition of Thursday’s Science journal.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in researching life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the discovery, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
"The discovery shows that in other planetary environments organisms may be able to use other elements to trigger biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not a coincidental discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
“As a result, organisms find it difficult to distinguish these elements separately.”
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, somehow, gum the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that this could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth’s existence, she says; thus, the researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways of shaping life, not just the way life on Earth was shaped in the beginning," said Foster, who wasn't part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were recovered late on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department, said.
“The good news is that the dogs are fine,” says Whitmore.
“They are in good shape.”
“They have been returned to their legitimate owners.”
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say that,” Whitmore said.
“We follow the orders.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately at Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until they were discovered Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national "AKC/Eukanuba" championship in Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in other competitions scheduled in the days ahead of the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba," Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s a month-long canine exhibition tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their truck outside, right next to the window of their bedroom.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard the flight of the truck at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, MGM restructuring is only waiting for the final green light from the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially praised on Thursday the “pre-packaged” plan by creditors that would clear about $5 billion of debt; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing films and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no longer exists any legal obstacle for MGM to float back under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a lightweight studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has entered into a $500 million credit facility, planned to finance MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which itself strikes at $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest amounting to $300 million a year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to sell the company.
However, the auction attracted few biders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team had begun working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which raised $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million “success bonus.”
Barber and Birnbaum intend to resume MGM’s production, which has only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films to be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, has attempted to a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget Balanced
Although the top candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed,, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a big break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumpers, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three domestic toy vendors – Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us, and BJ’s Wholesale Club – to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It’s clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are dirty toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them onto your belly.
One pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-changing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance with its innovative articulated legs with wheel-locking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you’re a child in the 80s, you’ll remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with questionnaire card game designed to turn a ride into a session with self-correction and a valve workbook.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
VTech’s Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games don’t educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years old), it’s the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer, brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to deliver games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows family photos to be displayed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a pen box, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to train words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online Penguin Club pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be wheeled skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and above) is the latest micro-robot button stack.
The false bestiole moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.

Bringing a Soft Side to Maintaining Order in China
Tang Shenbin arpented a city square as a city sergeant on training by strictly inspecting his nerve loads, issuing lowly orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan — imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and inclination to violence — to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
“Keep yourself right!”
“Be wise!”
Show them, he said, “How do beautiful girls look like!”
Four girls who had just spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and pants of olive color, were fiddling at the guard.
Four pairs of black heels, aligned with the rule.
Four well-maintained hats perfectly folded to the top of the hair attached by a rayed blue and white node.
“Personally, I think they have an average appearance,” said Mr. Tang, with contempt.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
In 2009, a report that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colportor packed up his things and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police with 13 women, specifically chosen for their appearance, galbe and youthful age.
The idea is to give the degrossie police a milder, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have trouble attracting attention to this underground urban brigade from China
The critics will say.
Unlike the police, these agents are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei provincial inspectors beat to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a stolen and online training manual for Beijing inspectors describes how to effectively defeat criminals without shedding blood.
This year in Shanghai, a strawberry carrier was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street sellers.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after a further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a “real total cleansing.”
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, appearing in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if the women had real duties or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement required female candidates, aged between 18 and 22, to have a beautiful figure and “the five features of the face in the right order.”
They must be above average height, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officers said the work was physically too hard for women over 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the candidates' outer qualities will determine whether they fit; it's about height, weight, face traits, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the “internal qualities.”
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: “In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city district management office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of the facial traits.
That it means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Persons with disabilities or disabilities should not apply.
“We can’t let a boxer or a bossu come to serve here,” Zheng said.
“It’t give a good picture.”
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has grafted cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn’t consider highlighting her appearance as sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?” she asked disappointedly.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dam colleague, says, “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They didn’t oppose their mandate being limited, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the streets where they are supposed to limit their business.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen walking merchants who move quickly on foot or bicycle, trying to sell as many small loaves or tofu bowl as possible before taking the run.
“Master Wang, you have to go.”
"We've already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu as a seller ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle bike.
Officers describe their functions as more monotonous than tough.
"It's about the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies after-work marketing.
“A very routine.”
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the assets of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of hostility against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police and officers in Chengguan were wounded, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
Peace is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the plain Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted to the scandal.
A 15-minute arm of iron followed before the policemen, with sinister faces, made an elbow road toward their vehicle and departed at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators – men aged 40 or older – play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a curly image.
“Sometimes we struggle verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice ministry prosecutors have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said it was “very happy” with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed that Senator Ensign is no longer the subject of the investigation and that he has no intention ofining any charges against him in this case.”
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, saying there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first disclosed in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was forbidden by law for a year to lobby his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual deal between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in conflict with the so-called ban on lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, “there appears to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantial violation of the rotating door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the ministry judge refused to explain the reasoning leading to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the ministry seemed to be cautious about political prosecution after a number of high-level retaliations raised by its public integrity department, including last year’s decisions to abandon prosecution against former senator Ted Stevens accused of failing to prosecute.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take the guns, said Melanie Sloan, the general director of Citizens’ Responsibility and Ethics at Washington, a defence group that has received several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don’t apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief attorney, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and follow-up the next day, telling him the ministry was not seeking charges against his client.
Ensign’s team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, “had acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor’s office.
“I’m not comfortable entering into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except to say we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's parents' payment of $96,000 to Hampton violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a leading Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was “mortelling” the interior ministry on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case emerged last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
Afterining a low profile for several months, Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tapping far in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and children tied to their beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Hayes’ lawyers have already filed evidence with the court that outlines appeal arguments, which could occupy the courts for years.
What’s provocative is that the intense reporting of the trial – along with the widespread and widespread use of Twitter by journalists – created a “circus atmosphere,” a so widespread and instantaneous saturation with flaming details that the jury was badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could drive appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in the hearings rooms.
“I’ve experienced this in this trial; I think there’s a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearings rooms undermines the rights of individuals to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’s lawyer, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State High Court, laconically rejected the claims in last week’s ruling, claiming that the media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Appellate courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment dated 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court annulled the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a “carnival atmosphere in the trial” because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeal courts appealed to revise half a century later Mr. Hayes’s conviction may be curious given the argument that new rules could be needed to manage the media in the hearings, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says some appeal judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from the hearings rooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one among many others described by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays the execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical to prosecutors, and that he abusively put pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jury was not arrested.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a contest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by governor and U.S. Senate candidates.
Theyined that the computer media continued to ignite the flames of the affair’s emotions.
“The daily tweeting of the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “did not resemble anything that had been seen before here, in New Haven, and even nationally.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the instant news was more flaming than the communiqués delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have stated that appeals courts were often drawn to the arguments that social and technological changes required adjustment by the courts.
Mr. Hayes’ lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the Supreme Court’s 1966 ruling that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s sentence due to media coverage of the trial and specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
“This affair,” they wrote, “represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can civilization bring the divisions closer?
After a campaign marked by invectivity and negativity, a minimum of civilisation broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a precursor sign of a real bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders has produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be addressed during the “shallow duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of mutual testing and testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent participants’ comments revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxation, expenses, health care or fees, both sides remain miles away.
Nevertheless, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
This is inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse party passions and then they fade away.
It is good.”
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "cowed duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favor of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve part or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on extending unemployment benefits, even because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
Following Tuesday’s White House meeting, more optimism is expected about a possible agreement on the issues discussed during the session on the “shallow duck”, with the ratification of the “New START” pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the “lame duck” session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to real cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to be up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the deficit commission’s recommendations that include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the toughest tasks in Washington and, according to them, put the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18 member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had a hard time reaching that number.
The biggest resistance remains among the group’s elected; which suggests that there is little motivation or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston planned two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and healthcare; to be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the party spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Those who are judged to be losers will have to change their course and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic viewpoint.
Partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
Meanwhile, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilisation exposed this week may be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a ground of agreement on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and sends to the Kremlin part of the bribery and protection money it collects, the U.S. embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are making huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves upstairs.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The rating is based on sources whose names have been cleared.
It was drafted while Yuri Lujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has since been little trace of cleansing.
Lujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied allegations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these allegations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The overwhelming majority of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unheard of conceiving that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow City government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
“The criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City government.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
“Luzhkov is at the top.”
“The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level.”
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB brushes money from the largest companies and that the police target small ones.
One source, he said, “explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more resources and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law.”
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note points out that although the money collection is extensive, the protection itself can be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly mentioned the fight against corruption, but he has admitted little progress.
The embassy’s note transmitted reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev relies on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of the Indem think tank in Moscow.
“But it’s part of that bureaucracy.”
“He is not part of a political class because there is no one in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the cost of corruption is estimated to be more than $300 billion per year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent poll on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (country ranked at least as most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which was made only yesterday late in the evening, Moscow time, will surely stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Lujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by Larry King on CNN, Putin hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the statements that U.S. diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure, and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Former Khmer Rouge fighters forced to face the past
In a poorly illuminated classroom with poor quality concrete walls, Anlong High School Director Veng spoke of the man who had built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves Ta Mok.”
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," Sreng Kor Ma, 42, said.
Known as “the butcher” for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwest Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly face people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, issued its first sentence against a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch", to 35 years in prison.
Faced with this evolution of the situation, anxiety has risen among the former Khmer Rouge fighters of Anlong Veng; complicating their efforts to reconcile and their willingness to re-integrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“The situation creates divisions within families.”
Under the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-United government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrilla from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect from the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held the head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have sunk into the black misery common to rural areas of Cambodia; and many are those who remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some elite Khmer Rouge officers have retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for depositing arms, they are low-grade and unskilled farmers.
“These people benefited from very little follow-up after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which hosts public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are immersed in the agraric utopian ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised in an environment where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
“Ta Mok feeds everybody.”
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, at the beginning of next year.
The court’s mandate is to judge senior executives and the main perpetrators of crimes but it did not say whether it was proceeding beyond these four cases.
More would be needed to calm the fears at Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to Im Chaem, 64, a former district head in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were believed to have died.
Recently, on a thirsty evening, Im Chaem was returning from work to the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is peaceful and stable,” she said.
“If there are more persecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the Documentation Center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,” he says.
"We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A 75-page history of Democratic Kampuchea."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s history textbooks, designed for higher schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
19-year-old Touch Valeak, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, flooded with weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soil, covered with a rotted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone seller on the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who was incinerated there.
“But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus to renounce military-grade uranium stocks
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons, as part of a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The deal was disclosed in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have unleashed the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to remove the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a official who mentioned the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, held at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" taken by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the George W. Bush administration.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept high-enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first operation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
He was loaded onto a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization has been implemented to strengthen confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Center, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“Al welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remain essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has made no objections to the CIA’s robberies
The government has made no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by documents filed by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, which add that the first vice-president of the government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked the Spanish Executive to be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, a meeting was held between the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council report "had surprised the Zapatero Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to prevent them from being “taken undue,” Aguirre said in a cable.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest profile possible, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, attorney Vicente González told the embassy that he would not block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
The United States has expressed concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the U.S. ambassador and the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are crazyly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of a flammy rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expressed concern about the action of the PP in this case.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those disclosures have negative consequences for the U.S. Government,” she said.
The parricide who passed to confessions complained in the network of the "abuse" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as a child, communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two originated from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tunez, an industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never allowed him to get a DNA test.
We found a new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elected was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is heard that their idyll has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed good to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the boy with my mother, and I'll take him when I get home," she claims.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself at a job post not to lose it."
She explained that if everything was fine, she would have taken her eldest with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intent, considering their bad relationships.
There is another post in July.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, died.
Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other.
"On one side he's with me and he likes this place a bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
It is about a trip to Mallorca.
"It's going to be there (the child) at a few summer hours and so I save a little money from the babysitter."
17 greetings and greetings.
“A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come.”
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, you see, when he wants, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there’s one: “He advances me with money.”
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now locked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
“Terror to the Galician.”
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares her regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had happened so that she didn’t tell him the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary of Palma, coming from the centre of judicial detainees of Minorca.
Her lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts happened, "and she also did not intend to hurt the minor."
She had previously admitted to drowning Caesar in the bath and placing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these comices normally doubles that it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party obtained 610,473 votes at the general elections in 2008, while the Autonomous Party in 2006 had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend isined, desired by a distraction of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate to the PP, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one member - it now has three - while ICV would keep one member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda isined, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the popular may also be decisive in ending the socialist hegemony in the four province capitals and in their relay to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populists agree that the PSC could lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get the majority nor the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican defeat, it would not be fantastic that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its votes in all four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros,ins very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Populars have also made progress in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detained by agents of the Barcelona Police’s General Information Commissionary formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, among them “The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land” (LTTE) and “Laskar e Taiba” (Let), the latter being the author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of making sure that with “Operation Kampai” the al-Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus has been “weakened” at the international level and “thus its operational capacity”.
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that were part of the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network held operational in Europe, which is why in the investigations participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the days following the shootings similar to the recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another operation was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who headed the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network – a part of which was hit in 2009 – mostly stole passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the so-called “World Islamic Front”.
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators emphasize that so far no details have been found linking the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, several thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police gathered a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereign adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address in the middle of his term.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the appointment with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he got 18 deputies at the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to get loved, because the CiU candidate requires that at least one of the formations that will be exercised by the opposition abstains in the voting for the investiture.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for now, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are in Catalan key.
And with regard to the PP president, in order to support an investiture “all sovereignist and independentist discourses should be eliminated”, and the economic complicity – similar to that of the Basque Country – that the converging leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have a common bet on weakening the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrist says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
Olot center owners do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Geronna) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during the time he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discreditation that the entity may suffer for not detecting the night nurse’s criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he has not ceased to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - who he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by phone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
The La Caritat lawyer added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudence on the part of any person other than the accused."
The person already dubbed the "Angel of Death" confessed yesterday to 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused her death by injecting an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the center staff to the medical facilities.
Insulin injections and the sedative cocktail were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the internals, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after successfully committing eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted suddenly yesterday to Trichet’s yesterday’s threat that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral differentials closed by force and European banks' shares suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that just as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and highly speculative position closures.
Institutional investors are losing fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be blind to removing liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Last year’s sales in Portugal were very low.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 base points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to raise private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a fire of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest Beethoven's Hymn of Joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like Vivaldi’s four seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchange.
Unlike in February, the reaction from the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity we don’t need, the Treasury has more than $40,000 million in available liquidity, three times as much as in March, to very expensive types, and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar’s wife, “besides being, appearing.”
Courage, we can get out of it!
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers it "no right", the judicial council of El Enebro on the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to claim their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of part of the group.
The founder of the larger holding company of business services for companies does not seem to be willing to give in his dispute to be present in El Enebro’s governing bodies.
He was excluded from his board by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the shareholders’ meeting on 18 January this year whose contest is registered in the Commerce and Companies Register.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate No. 2 of Madrid, has once again opened the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The latest move of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resort of the petitioners his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly fraudulent the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the radically void assembly on January 18", according to its official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly takes place, to be challenged by considering that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully attempted that the magistrate convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a capital company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, asks for the usufruit on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the appeal request for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selected world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari triumph.
Without diminishing the skill as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to turn him into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far from the high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains from manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens's industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in his Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 squads had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
Red Bull’s team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes on the cars.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is Renault's sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Changes can move from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this crazy technological advancement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has deployed the high-tech factory to create and produce its cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
The staff for this task has 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull’s Formula 1 is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put in the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety is zero.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the plant, said five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in racing cars brought 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because “they are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP to install 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain Vice President Helena Herrero gave an example of the renovated store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opened were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible shops, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the deployment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores claims to “improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging.”
The store in Barcelona includes a space with a worldwide pioneering pilot program that solves potential problems with HP IT equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed specifically for SMEs and users, as the major companies have already contracted technical support services," said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell pledges to steal 1 million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be attempted to partially offset by increases in commissions and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit over the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will have a three-year validity.
The goal, besides surviving without the need to resort to the public subsidies of FROB, is to gain a market share by attracting one million new private clients – 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank – its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the particular client.
This year it attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when presenting the financial results.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima executive plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for another year.
Customers who let the savings casinos escape will be its primary target.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking affair, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war of liability – which penalizes margins – is reducing, the price of the risk premiums that banks and casinos pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving to the price of credit to offset the falling margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
“We didn’t tighten the crane, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the banking sector’s trend now “is to increase commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s executive plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain “we will request greater dimensions.”
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He says capital needs are “increasing enormously” and any Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalizations.
Having assured that Sabadell can survive the time shutdown of the markets, he has diminished the importance of the fact that some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, one can get short-term financing through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of savings fund mergers and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings funds began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they were reserving for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Cases (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been made, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the tutelage of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is being carried out "with the greatest speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is being carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
“The shift from 45 funds with an average of 28.500 million asset volumes to 17 with 75.500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "going at the highest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has done well with the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have triggered a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of the 426 euros of unemployment aid without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s criticism of her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks with that ofining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macro-economic control, fiscal rigour, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, therefore now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of discrepancy between what Germany thought it should be done (tax rigour plans and public finance stability) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then it has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the public were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time compel private lenders to bear a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it hastened the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, though slightly sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should witness the process of reforming the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not want to cross.
And it tells us all that even if we must now take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare payment cessation and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a part of the costs.
Germany signals us that we must follow a tough growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The set is clear.
It would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asking is much harder.
And what he should absolutely not do under these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give us a greater tranquility.
Let us take advantage of the opportunity that we have been given until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the way has been paved for the thesis that order must be put at home.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are being considered, one cannot rule out the possibility of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and law fraud
The tricks similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has shed a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the match (that their team already clearly won), both players deliberately wasted time when they made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up being the leader of its group, the two players will fulfill the regulatory penalty during the next match of the dam match against Auxerre and can pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned the team’s coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and various financial sums to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the case is due to the fact that this had as the protagonist a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which in past occasions sentenced its players to a fine for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an additional episode to his extended history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if with these actions a fraud of law is committed; because, in fact, they are actions respecting the sports regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to look at the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opponent players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, i.e. there was no violent play.
Another of those assets that is referred to with correct play is to prevent the team of offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not conform to what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, since its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action was precisely trying to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalization of the referee.
They waited and they gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is the type of benefit that offenders get from the deliberate misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to see that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the outcome of the action implies the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And that’s not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn’t rely on those players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, as the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action the players perform a penalty match and move to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the ladder, it’s not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of making strategic decisions that promote the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), otherwise they chose rather the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the penalty or escaping it.
Even though the boundary between genius and law fraud is diffuse, in this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises due to two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way to pass the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bulldozer and the lottery, when December arrives come also the dinner of groups before Christmas, which continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive with adjusted prices to capture the majority of customers: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
To end up complicating the accounting, the calendar of this year (as St. Sylvester's night falls Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Regardless of the circumstances, they all demand battle prizes, confirms the chairman of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
“People think a lot before booking.”
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he said.
The deal will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with a good service," he adds, and recalls that customers have a tendency to descend a ladder with the crisis, so that the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a poll in various establishments in the center, the collapse of applications for the night of the 17th was observed.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
“We did everything we could to keep the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources in the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champenoise method - 'cava'.
They also see early signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a bit.
On the part of the patronage Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That’s true, the hope for festivities has not fallen, no matter who pays, he said.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises concern in the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
WikiLeaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program raises in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details they offer about the content of conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, is "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is what Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the Taliban-attacked territory, the dispersal of nuclear materials whose noise is low and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is viewed, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to remain vigilant.
“Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said during a meeting with U.S. counterparts.
The new in the documentation filtered by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A mail from the Embassy in May, which described the communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” argued: “Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are removed.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it clear to the official that "the Pakistani army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups."
The WikiLeaks chief
Obama will appoint a senior anti-terrorist officer to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol has issued a red alert to track the movements and locate Assange.
Every aspect of Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track Assange’s movements.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, it’s on November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest filtering of more than a quarter million US diplomatic documents but with the sexual abuse accusations that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder lawyer Mark Stephens assured that “the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.”
On the 20th the international police force headquartered in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange “in order to obtain his interim arrest and extradition.”
Even though Interpol can’t give an arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization’s explanations, consider the red notice call a free path for arrest – which the national police body must implement – especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities through a video conference.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the world is looking for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he gave an unknown interview to Time magazine director via Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If one can show that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates to spy on the UN by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the opinions conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the House of Representatives, has asked the State Department to consider the possibility of including WikiLeaks on the terrorist list "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to reconsider his statements after saying that Assange would "be murdered."
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something like that.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the government who has filtered the information is guilty of betrayal and anything that is not an execution would be a too kind punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eyes on Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposed a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the ninth internal uprising within ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it can absolutely not give him the headaches he had with other extinguished currents.
That’s why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with eyelids that allow him to blind up to the municipal elections.
Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By voting, not by raising the hand.
If the carodists want to deliver a certain penalization vote to the president, they can do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand from the president a little more than putting his position at the disposal of the militant, a gesture that does not apply when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a roadmap until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the national council’s vote on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a certain fact.
The ERC leader admitted that “polyphony” affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash his room laundry in the family.
In this line, the article that the current counselor Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, of which he highlights two.
The first, to “recompose” the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militance, that is, to include new figures that come from the Carod adept sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly as a working mechanism once and for all.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion commissioned the leadership to revise the assembly model in a specific congress to reform the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, it might be a good time to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the Mexican state’s MILENIO, there has been a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the pre-last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the grace shot at the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage bag of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Very early on Thursday morning, on the fourth, landowners found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message theoretically signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots as he was leaving his home to start the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a shot in the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the forehead, the body of a man was found on a lonely road from Colonia El Naranjo and underneath the body a bullet struck with a 25-caliber firearm was found.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the colony Plaza Golondrina.
Emergency services conducted extensive searches of the remaining members of the body, but they were not found.
Tepotzotlán residents alerted about the discovery of a corpse found in Peña Colorada, with hands tied behind and eyes banded.
The man was injured by a gunshot in his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle on the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza was, two warning messages of death were discovered at the same time as the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the village of Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was localized who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, in accordance with a message that his executors had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunfire in the neck, the dead body of a woman was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman’s skin, Santa Muerte tattoos and collars with her image were detected.
At the end of the month, the body of a man was found in a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads rubbed and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, “This is what happens to those who don’t align.”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon tape and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, officers found a bristol with a message.
Chinains targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The country’s representative at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its coal footprint and detailed that itins its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China isining its pledge to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its coal footprint and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he explained, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its goals, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institutional building; and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the passing last year of a new Energy Act, which recognises the targets for reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated way with government and local authorities to energy savings, energy efficiency and emissions reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multiannual plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial project of climate change, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economical lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historic contribution in pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to claim what right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been a successful approach to local elections and has achieved its goal," he said.
Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and makes us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elect the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the lead "to the person determined by the council."
“I’m completely quiet and open, I’d be proud to leave the office of party chairman to any of the five.”
He predicted that the rebound recorded by the party at the last election on July 4 will be reflected in the next dispute, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so we have made "many hopes with regard to them, and I am sure that Gabino will meet expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four-year government, César Nava asked priists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them get out of the 'closet,'" he said.
He stated that the holder of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditory, because in the country there is no sting, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes law for students without papers
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree to the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve that legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps an open cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope to be soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continues.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is resolved, a agenda for the rest of the projects can be set.
“I think we have a lot of time.”
“We all agree that this tax problem must be solved by the end of the year.”
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "debat closing vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize paperless students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, though most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the contribution of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project’s supporters lobby intensely to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That’s why Dream Act supporters require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the Republicans with the most courtesy are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing senator George Lemieux from Florida, who completed the term as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who has backed him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put the finger on the wound.
The second stage of the Pleasures de la langue was a walk in which participants made the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what is hoped of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and who this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound"...it puts us in embarrassment," the Argentine writer gently threw to the public, mostly young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and to which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "sickness" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound."
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist soup relieved and concludes: "On the wound I could only know that it is who is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very closely linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative he titled Praise for the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous snorkeler who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to speak later America, the great news that from the beginning had its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narratives of the captains conquerors.
“Cervantes, who invented us all (writers), laughed at the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in some way one would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty.”
Nevertheless, he emphasized, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the Cervantes tradition.
“It is through her legacy that one is what one tells.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL's invitation with her roundtable He must on the wound.
The Puerto Rican Cuban has put her on the big wound of social violence that her country is going through – and Latin America shares – producing disputes over drug trafficking and sale.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not, of course, premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the speech of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it owes on the wound of the engaged writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at a high speed also in terms of intellectual habits and consciousness control that turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"In order to be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romero in search of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that face each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up comforting himself with the sub-champion medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with a overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also arrived in the decisive duel and lost again with the overall score of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a reverse, as his team made a match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and eventually three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Ruben has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to get rid of the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break any statistics, it’s for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I’ll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important,” he said when asked what would be his weak points in the finals.
“The only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whispers the final, we can’t celebrate, we’re ready in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already ready to run and I think this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can’t celebrate.”
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which doesn’t bother him, because he trusts his players: “We never seek to get to the penalties series, we try to finish in the regular deadline, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the fate made us a bad turn, sometimes it’s the emotions or anxiety of holding the title in our hands, hands it escaped us, it served as a lesson for this final and we hope we don’t get into that situation again.”
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by titles.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Center before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost the waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to appear at the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before interviewing at the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have a number of advantages for applicants, among which are the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will no longer be a need to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for business and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the AUC, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For more information about the new procedure for applying for the visa, visit the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When citing the press, NASA assured that it would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the true scope of the discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germ PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th just settled when in Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared independence and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Houses.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, "toned" against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate ‘bipartism’ because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board of Directors chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these institutional reforms we constitute the political marginalization on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the PAN and PRI representatives to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they did not, they would be enslaved by both parties again and in this way the opposing coalition would end.
"So far (the opposition coalition) has arrived, that's what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 lawmakers and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more, the Convergent added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now Congress has turned into a 'bottle' between the two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the member’s personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 deputies, now the five we see, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they made, that they decided, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for the “supplier”
The Municipality of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles of pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electric equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the municipality, this latest check number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of supplier account".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Higher State Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been is the total debt and, as a result, checks will still be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“We haven’t bought anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Even though the provider has not yet published in the State Official Journal, according to the Law’s forecasts when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had released a review of the checks that the City Hall issued to its suppliers, revealing that between March 2008 - July 2010, in the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, collecting cheques worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be taken care of
Tourism entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundpoint in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist into a hole in the Sánchez Taboada roundpoint, the Mazatlán tourism sector has asked authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be cared for and new activities must replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor state of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come there to walk and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to shut down a business one day and they don’t know how much wealth is lost, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just do the corrective," he said.
“We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area it must beined, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well.”
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it does not only depend on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
“We didn’t give them the attention they needed and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious to everyone, the interview is necessary.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that must be linked together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and sites that we should order first, clean up and put us online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP Requests Results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
Mazatlán’s business sector is calling for a decent working legislature and free of agreements between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
“We hope that MEPs will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary that they make pact to protect their own interests and they turn into a carnival mascara of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that make the current Governor progress.
“We will ensure that they do a decent work and above all are committed to society and sectors as the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the last election.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
Regarding tourism activity, he asked the new legislators to give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as a major economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly rivals with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources to detonating tourist projects that help to give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to solve.
Looking for the Mage King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is made up of no more or less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day-to-day because their father doesn’t have a stable job.
“Sometimes it’s very difficult for us, because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we sell mandarines and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebes’ to sell in the street,” says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or bicycle, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months, Cayetana suggests clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster,' but I said to him 'we'll see, my son,' because he was very dear," Cayetana remembers with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, wears the size 12; Isaías, 10, wears the size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears the size 8.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign On Search for the Mage King, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estria on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were believed to have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, silver and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged heads of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long investigation, which lasted a year.
"It is the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
About 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sécurité du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration will continue
The conservative bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten when the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
“I strongly rely on the Charter.”
"I stand with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by MPs after holding the Caucus weekly meeting.
Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it is attacking the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we'll see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisones children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are massively telling MEPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a clover.”
“They expect Canada to take strong action,” Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections if it was rejected.
One conservative, however, told QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that every MP who opposes would then explain to his voters.
The unity is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission to investigate the matter.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this subject since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
There was no need for more for the Beijing public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe the announcement as “a rabbit out of a hat” and “a brick-up solution on the corner of a table.”
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it,” he said.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ president, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have an investigative commission is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the auditor general,” he concluded.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government’s cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request came from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in this type of investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this case.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit groups of motorcyclists, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently enacted the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another slide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
One road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell in several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some sectors, we fear the overflow of several rivers.
Flood warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and du Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood guards and remained under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, heavy rainfall has resulted in the overflow of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was removed due to heavy rains.
Ten homes were evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Le Loup.
Partly blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial reversal before the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians as well as his rough wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some statements contained “inexact information on social assistance, undue negative representations of Haitians and rough language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day.”
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Joint Front of Quebec Social Assistants.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators should present solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life’s problems.
“The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes challenged by ‘After noon’ have addressed a delicate topic in a fair and appropriate way.”
There was no blame in his place.
The latest dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then surrendered to a face-to-face media that had caused a lot of reactions.
The organizer of CHOI said he had made no donations to help the Haitians because one could not know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an undue negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve been suspended for three days.”
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of rude language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated “beyond its obligation”.
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of large listening within three days.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealese of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special path.
The athlete who excels in “sanda” (kung-fu “full contact”), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008, said.
“In my case, I look for fights somewhat everywhere, as for those who don’t like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, he worked as a security agent and committed for UPS, delivering bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he explained.
“I’m currently preparing to go to China for the San Shu World Cup.”
"Fighters who finished among the top four in the last World Championship in each category were invited."
“I won the bronze in Toronto in 2009.
In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished eighth.
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
“At this pace, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
“San shou” or “sanda” is a discipline native to China, where kicking and kicking, as well as projection on the ground, are permitted.
Duels originally take place on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of fighting is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will surely match his presence in the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
“This competition is the most important and prestigious in China,” explained the sympathetic gaillard.
“It’s a bit like the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
“It was a superb experience.”
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed."
“There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).”
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this laval of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by the firms BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor that obtained the largest, the management of the project, for a sum of $ 295 million without a tender.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management consortium took the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and provoking an increase in prices.
"This is the new way to make collusion and defeat competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly," said MP Sylvain Simard at a news conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he says he can hardly see how the public interest can be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm beginning to have my journey," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "unhonest" and had "missed rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their respective expertise in order to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The construction is underway and will last until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition acting; there was negotiation.
The consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortiums in the engineering-consulting sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick flight through the Quebec Register of Companies enables more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to particular workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
The big boss of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made the fact that the project management contract was granted on an optional basis.
“If you go to a bid and there are few biders, your prices will be higher.”
“You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say, ‘We’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal with a good price.’”
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that matters, it’s people’s competence,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin signed 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They totalled $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau laid down that the PQ is also linked to those firms that "finance" it, before clarifying that it was rather its leaders.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainability actors, but also in fair brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Even if he swims in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption lurk, he regrets a lack of credible information, which he even calls a brake to his commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecans seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the company’s green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications applied to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands appearing as environmentally responsible, the Barometer says.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems crucial to stimulate this trend of consumption currently driven by a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of information would calm the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, one-third of Quebecers say they are suspicious of the alleged performance of the green products or services that are being put into their hands.
On another note, almost half of consumers in 2010 changed their habit and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to meet their beliefs.
At the level of 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, the Barometer said.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by concerned about animal protection.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside of his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecans indicated that they used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which just took its first cliche.
A state loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked to finance the acquisition of the eXcentris film complex by Angus and Parallèle, agreed to cooperate, but only with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full cinematic vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution under favorable conditions, at least according to the opinion of sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and a 12.8 million request had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been reviewed downward.
A proposal and a plan of action have been sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the eXcentris file.
He sent him a final report ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counterproposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
Parallele and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of state donation really has to be discarded.
The Association of Cinematographers and Cinematic Parks Owners of Quebec opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to fund real estate projects, which it did not for other cinemas.
However, a number of environmental stakeholders demanded substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of canyons, for ten years carried out the author's cinema in his premises of the complex after financing its construction himself, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to get its clientele.
The Angus Company and the Parallele, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are running a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films on eXcentris.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 next by projecting the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall The Duty and it is unknown what he and his group think of the down proposals that are being made to them.
The wave lifted over a complex Canada.
The new U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. regards as the Canadians’ inferiority complex toward the Americans, but at the same time betray the Americans’ sense of superiority toward Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter doesn’t have Canadian-American relations in mind when going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out on the public square yesterday, offer more crushing details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of the federal election campaign, reports how far the United States is out of the topics discussed by political leaders.
The US ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“A inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than bringing this election to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about.”
The ambassador does not understand this “dumb silence” as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business officer in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the February confidence vote on the federal budget, which will show Canada’s first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion relief plan,” Breese wrote.
It is nowhere mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed boost plan.
Another statement, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that CBC’s dramatic series are sending back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or the kidnappings for the CIA’s muscular interrogation.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of “case by case”.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, “he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
“The secretary agreed to review the file.”
The news is that the WikiLeaks website has been heated.
Tom Flanagan, a former counsellor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
The United Nations has proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) equivalent to one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan follows the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluorocompact bulbs or, better, by diode-electroluminescent bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the majority of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of greenhouse gas emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of the global car fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should boost global greenhouse gas emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to stabilize the climate rise to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice.
A fluorescent light bulb lasts an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week – this company has also participated in the UN study – have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all-new bulbs can also work with rhostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain mercury.
Several specialists have raised concerns about compact fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluorocompact bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, or the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, called for the publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election "without delay" after the deadlines expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent election commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all ivory sides and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission let the deadline for midnight pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the CIS president told television that the commission was “continuing to work” to announce the results.
Calls multiplied worldwide on Wednesday for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council's cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, the president’s campaign director, said the FN’s electors’ intimidation manoeuvres in the north of the country had deterred the president’s supporters from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are held by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who denies any connection with the former rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go to claim the victory.
His allies say Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from spreading the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has remained divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished at the top of the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France according to the International Bureau of Labour (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolises (9.7% counting overseas departments), according to the corrected data of seasonal variations (CVS) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed in the metropolitan area is 2,631 million.
The second quarter data was confirmed for 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over the course of a year, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the BIT.
The elderly experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as over a year), or 482,000 people 50 years or older, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only the 25-49 years old benefited from a stability of unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over a year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini arrested and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a manager of waste processing companies and brother of the president of the PS of the general council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and arrested at the Luynes detention house, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abuse of social property, misappropriation of public funds and goods, reckoning, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain on all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reproachable leaders, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted, through his lawyers, to pass the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also arrested on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the allocation of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never had knowledge of it, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former general director of services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was charged on Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban to meet the protagonists of the case.
“My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts he is accused of.”
"The instructor magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been charged and released in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director for the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is charged with “influence trafficking and passive corruption”.
Two officials from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "subtract and misappropriation of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with “repeating abuse of social assets”.
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently stunned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from the big banditism.
The investigation is carried out as part of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mailings, for alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the waste chain.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects waste in Aubagne as well as some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss Case: The Elysee Exaggerated Syrian Mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", has kept public opinion in France, put the diplomacy in alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the eye of American diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some underlying of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, ranging from giving them advice for dealing with their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by U.S. justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put a raw light on how the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
Elysee Advisor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d’Orsay Director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, will meet with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
He explained the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “mortem constantly” in the media the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate release”.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it even more because the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
Because, after attempts to discuss discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory manoeuvres".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros in bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates further hostage crises, a phenomenon that “will get worse.”
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days but remains trapped in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The US embassy, like many observers, questioned this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear equipment, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted a deal?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only “completely surprised by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French presidency and the seals guard" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the judicial decision," he notes.
Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains placed under the "strict" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser composes a phone number, hangs, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée made no effort, through communications and “flight” organized in the media, to make believing that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role as a “mediator”.
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears fruit as several press articles replicate the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes “the media ‘blitz’ of French officials”.
What is the basis for so much “gratefulness” expressed to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praiseful statements, French officials confess in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then examines the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role”, Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The aim is also to “seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The US embassy knows this well.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
“We thanked them anyway.”
“This should at least cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is in the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their “active role in the liberation of our compatriot.”
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cinderella” law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to parliament in December to require online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, representatives from the ministries of culture and family said.
“Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministry official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who require free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intense Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA announces host countries
In the midst of turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appointed the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking the step over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen's competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The year 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its settlement in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political challenges of a World Cup.
Therefore, the negotiations behind the scenes may last until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two members of the European Commission (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC released a documentary on Monday featuring three influential members of the European Commission, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is why FIFA is discontented and embarrassed by British officials, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the forefront.
The head of government hopes to repeat the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who won in 2005 for London the host of the 2012 Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to bring England back to the EC?
Nothing is less certain as the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could stifle their ambitions.
Eventual retaliations against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a weight outsider despite the gaps in its record (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the trip to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the British press against the members of the European Commission.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, stronger than the 1994 experiment, appears as the logical favorites.
World's first economic power, home to the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a long way ahead of Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the World Cup-2026 to China, which was highly sought by FIFA, which would in fact make Asian chances out of place for 2022.
With Qatar, which has made the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new lands, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weak TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Section 2: The Evidence
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand had made me believe he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had any hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for another.
The current president will be elected in 2012.
But the obvious does not fit well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to act as if the doubt always exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
That he evokes in front of UMP parliamentarians, on Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sown a little fever.
Was this the official announcement of his nomination?
We were far away.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was an announcement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he talks about the presidential election, in a tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: “Don’t think I’m not thinking about the next step.”
His pre-yesterday remarks do not make him more candidate than yesterday; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, it is for a two-fold reason.
The run for the candidacy for the PS.
But it’s not Ségolène Royal’s entry into play that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS demand a battle order earlier than planned.
Bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UMP about this," the prime minister's surroundings reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes that defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Eurozone: ECB forced to keep on buying government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the ways to get out of the crisis or at least to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that should be completed by the end of the year.
As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institution will probably not be able to afford to be as perennial as it worsens a situation that is more than tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
In a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she believed the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
“I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)”
On the eve, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show himself more clear about his intentions, merely indicating that the program of buying government bonds on the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced that it will keep its core interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s treasury bond purchases doubled last week to 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it had made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased for €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market participants, there is no doubt about the expectations of continued purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not expect any significant change.
While lending operations lasting more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB continues to provide unlimited liquidity on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine she’s significantly changing her program.”
“Otherwise, it would be taking the risk of provoking new short-term tensions,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“A progressive output announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
by Oppenheim.
On the level of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds to animate an atone market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace the shortage of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," a leading bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, states will be more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it.
The protection of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi is round the back.
After a troubling start of the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a little yesterday, with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
Return to precarious calm.
At a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indescifrable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party later denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the gap with German long interest rates had reached a record of 210 base points and the price of bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CDS) had flown to 263 points, resulting in some agitation in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and a possible infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” said Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with it, causing the state to run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate looks at 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecasted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will need to be taken," said Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For now, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have repeated it for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required from Italy are less than those required from other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The issue is political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Deputies, following which early elections could be held in late March.
It would then open up a period not suitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde said in a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I think we have demonstrated it again on Sunday, day and night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relatively, yesterday’s deflation on European government bond rates has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can’t talk about a start to normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted by speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs especially on the banking systems," estimate the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Conscious of this gap and the dangers it entails, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
The Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings will begin next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro area in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it prepares the ground for it.
The first issuance of FESF securities is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries in the front line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in terms of the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that complement austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both are willing at all costs to avoid seeking international assistance before implementing their own budget corrections and deciding on structural reforms necessary to sustainably restore trust.
Finally, European fund donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardizing the sovereign bond markets.
During his visit to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to advance the idea that if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the EU would not hesitate to put its hand on the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, estimate that an extension of around €100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which has so far been allocated €60 billion.
A council that has every chance to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and frost.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the 20 departments already in orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snowfall affects the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and there is little snow on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are noticeable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to restrict heavy-duty traffic.
The prefecture “invites all drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly.”
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights to Paris’s Roissy airport and 10% to Orly due to the coming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: First financial sketches
Since the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, billions have been raining.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion is being mentioned for the Grand Paris subway to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the state announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the SGP to borrow from the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Now we finally have the first additions.
The Rectificative Finance Act 2010, reviewed in the National Assembly’s Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "in the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is estimated: "The income from this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a redesign of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its output and affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it report?
and mystery.
This is not mentioned in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
“It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” the statement said.
In the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment you create revenue (both taxes), you can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion afterwards, it explains."
"It will be included in the budget and pulled out as soon as possible."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still to the absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat turbulent parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7.
Hackers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
Let us proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up by a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi’s sinisterly caricatural profile has long been for cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that secret records should only be compiled from already known news is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unprecedented research (neither does he know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism only believe what they already know, and which reaffirms what they had already learned.
This is the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
I go for the secret records.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what I know, editor at Libération), who only holds as true what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely, that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have turned into centers of espionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims in crisis so much as the “bulls.”
But let’s get back to the profound nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell’s time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy had been fully fulfilled since, being able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the crypt of power secrets cannot escape a hacker’s control, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that knowing anything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from her.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online – it would be like publishing it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it’s just as obvious that with current technologies, it’s futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and reserved relationships beined in the future?
I know well that, for now, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences to uncontrollable routes, bearing only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heels of a shoe.
The information will be stored in a single copy in locked boxes: in the bottom, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet reestablished a wireless telegraph (telephony).
Video cassettes (analog) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and back and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, by macro proportions.
With high-speed trains, you get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travel it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not surprising that politics and communications technologies come back to horseback cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was hidden in the secrets of the embassies.
Now it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate Change: How France Fails to Make Funding Promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine compliance with the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (so-called early start financing) made by developed countries.
And the French bulldozers are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU played the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start funding: report detailing the actions of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated for its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announced that it had allocated €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, be "new and additional", in order to ensure that additional effort is made without being at the expense of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what “new and additional” means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as the reference year: international funding isined, and it is adding 150 million over three years under fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France estimates that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the overall level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to meet its commitment in terms of “new and additional” funding.
Another important factor is the distribution between donations and loans.
There are no rules and everyone chooses their own method.
Some, like France, consider that 1 euro borrowed equals 1 euro given.
Obviously, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, only the cost of the loan for the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted under its commitments.
But France has nothing to do with such a reasoning: it "respects" its 420 million euro commitment by making 91,5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8,5% of donations (36,1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the EU that uses such a massive amount of loan.
Germany requires 46 percent, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (in other countries) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very vast majority of the European Union puts 1 € to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Lovely tour of pass!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, she comes to believe that she is spending €420 million “new and additional” in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other member states continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The early financing chapter is just a small, relatively short-term issue compared to the whole of the climate discussions.
But it could be another grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with other European Union countries.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or how loans are accounted for.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to advance the discussions.
Pesticides injected by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Future Generations (ex-Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results “do not have statistically significant value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated”, bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and one bite in a day by a ten-year-old child, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations – five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – as well as sweets, have been examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens, and five are classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors, according to studies from several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
“Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumers’ exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is worrying,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven certain carcinogens as well as twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, which was planned to be used in the study, contains traces of six chemicals, one of which is a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for Kenya’s green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
Furthermore, the steak, the tuna in the box, and even the bag of bread and chewing gum were filled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most “rich” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this “contaminant cocktail” is “probably underestimated,” according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the rise of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
