Welsh AMs worried about 'looking stupid'
Some AMs are concerned about the suggestion to change their titles to MWPs.
The problem has arisen due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum have expressed concern that the decision could be ridiculed.
A Labour AM said that "it sounds like Twp and Pwp" had caused concern in his group.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means foolishness and pwp means foolishness.
One Plaid AM said the group was "displeased" and suggested alternative names.
A Welsh Conservative said his group had an "open mind" about changing the name, but added that it was just another form of muppet or foolishness from the MWP.
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English pronoun u.
The Assembly Commission, which is preparing the legislation to change the current names, has said: "The final decision on the details of what the members of the Assembly should be called will be made by the members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017, gave the Welsh Legislative Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a public opinion on the proposals, which showed strong support for the legislation to be called the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of AMs, the Commission was in favour of the name Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP had the most public support.
As the AMs suggested alternatives, but a consensus decision could be a headache for incumbent Commissioner Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft copy of the legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The reforms legislation will cover other changes in the functioning of the Legislative Assembly including rules disqualifying AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs have the final vote on the question of what they should be called when discussing legislation.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether or not to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece over its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has also insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents ownership over its territory and has overtly objected to its efforts to gain EU and NATO membership.
Gyorgy Ivanov, the Macedonian president who opposes the name change vote, said he does not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price of EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent as Harlem churches struggle.
The elderly people I spoke to said that historically there was a bar and a church on every corner.
"Today, there is neither".
He said that bars can understand the vagaries.
He said that nowadays, people interact in different ways.
Today, bars are no longer the comfortable neighborhoods where people regularly go.
As for the churches, they think that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, and that they will return to where they started their journey not today but tomorrow.
He further said, churches can be removed and apartment buildings with condominiums can be built and people who do not have the inclination to help their neighbours can live in these buildings.
He said that most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white. He wanted the day to come when these churches would close together, because it is unlikely that people who come to live in these condominiums will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white religious groups before Harlem became the capital of blacks - that is, before it became a metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin's became such a community decades later.
The original white Methodist religious group left in the 1930s.
A religious group of blacks worshiping nearby took possession of the building.
The Reverend John Howard Johnson led a religious group of blacks to take over St. Martins, which was the scene of a struggle against the retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was heavily damaged in a fire in 1939, but as the parish followers of Father Johnson had plans to rebuild the building, Carillon was given the job.
Father Johnson's son and St Martin's heir, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called Carillon "the poor man's bell".
The experts who played Carillon in July called it by another name: "cultural asset" and "unalterable historical instrument".
It was also the world's first carillon played by black musician DiNisio A. Lind, said Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan. Lind had moved to Riverside Church 18 years earlier to play an even bigger carillon.
According to the late Meriwether, St. Martins did not change him.
The scenes at St. Martin's in the past few months have been filled with complexities of architects and contractors, some of whom were called by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Westerly, the governing body of the parish of Le Leeds, expressed its concern in July by writing to the diocese, saying that while Westerly had no responsibility whatsoever for hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent, the diocese was directing Westerly to pay its expenses.
Some parishioners complained that the role of the diocese was not transparent.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in a lobster in California
A 13-year-old boy jumped into the water to catch a lobster on the opening day of the lobster season in California, when he was attacked and injured by a shark, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammell, who spoke to KSWB-TV in San Diego, said he heard a boy screaming for help while diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning and went on a boat with a group to get the boy out of the water.
'At first, Hamel thought it was the excited cries of a boy catching a lobster. But when he listened more carefully, he realized that the boy was screaming in pain, 'It bit me!'
I was bitten!'
And Hamal went near, and looked upon the lad, and said, Behold, his neck is broken off.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" continued Hamel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital and his condition was critical, the hospital said.
It was not known which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
Speaking to the media, Life Guard Captain Larry Jales said a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed not to be an endangered species.
Further explaining, Jails said that the wounded man had traumatic injuries to the upper part of his body.
The beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamis in Escinitas was banned by the authorities for 48 hours for the purposes of interrogation and security.
The Jails said that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not considered to be endangered.
SenseBaris plans to tap into the UK cosmetics market
It will be a strong competitor to Boots, Super Drugs and Debannums through its department store-style, expert assistant beauty isles.
The firm, which is entering the UK's ever-growing £2.8 billion beauty market with declining fashion and homewear sales, will test its large beauty aisles at 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will open more stores next year.
The space reserved for TVs, microwaves and homeware is now being invested in cosmetics as supermarkets compete for the space to be used for cosmetics.
For the first time, Sainsbury's has announced plans to offer 3,000 beauty products including brands like Revlon, SC, Tweaser Man and Dr. Papa.
The current Loreal, Mabeline and Berts Bees products will also be branded on par with the shops' products like boots.
The supermarket is also restoring its boutique makeup range with the aim of selling vegetarian-friendly products in larger quantities.
In addition, Fragrants Shop, a perfume retailer, will offer discounts at one of the two Sainsbury's stores in Croydon, South London, which opened last week and the second one in Selly Oak, Birmingham, which will open later this year.
In these days of online shopping and the increasing habit of buying small food items from convenience stores every day, it is a lot of work to convince people to visit supermarkets.
Mike Coop, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said their outlets would look more like department stores and supermarket chains would compete with Aldi and Lidl, who are competing at a discount by offering more services and non-food items.
Sencebaris has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and many Habitatts have also introduced and bought both these ranges two years ago, which has increased grocery sales and thus profits from store purchases.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical divisions have failed.
Sensei Barris started a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration between them ended after a dispute over how to share the proceeds from the drug stores in its supermarkets.
Sainsbury's took a new strategy after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy stores, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a key role in the project by adding more luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty isles to add more gloss to the store atmosphere for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues who are always available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet the needs of everyone and with a charming atmosphere and convenient locations, we have emerged as a market for mind-blowing beauty products that dispel the old shopping habits".
'Condemned' Peter Jones after he walked out of the £11 deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has been suspended by the Dragons' Den after withdrawing from the £11 million lifestyle brand deal with Peter Jones, in order to deal with her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willby has no time for Truly, his brand of homeware and accessories.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this morning's show has revealed on Instagram that she is going out of the deal.
Jones' anger has been tempered by the last-minute withdrawal of the lucrative lifestyle brand deal of Peter Jones of Dragon's Den fame, Holly Willoughby, in order to focus on her new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was furious that his new £1.5 million deal would not allow him to give up time for Jones's homeware and accessories brand Truly, the TV's golden girl, during a crucial visit to Jones's business office in Marlow, Birmingham Hampshire, on Tuesday, sources said.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was estimated to add £11 million to Willaby's fortune.
37-year-old Willby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, late Aunt Jones, who had travelled to her holiday home far away from Britain.
According to one source: "Hali always gave Truly first priority.
It would have supported her future for a long time and kept her popularity for a few more decades.
Her decision to withdraw from the contract came as a surprise to all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, except that the launch was the next day.
The warehouse at Marlo HQ is packed with ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe the departure of one of Britain's most popular stars, the presenter of This Morning, could cost the firm millions and further delay its launch, as the firm has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homeware.
And that can end a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have known Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Along with Willoughby and Cap, he founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as president in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willaby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will be the host of the upcoming show I Am a Celebrity M on ITV, in place of Aunt MacPartlin.
Last night, a person close to Jones said, "We don't like to comment on his business activities".
First the rough words, 'Then we started to love'
He joked that he would be criticized by the news media for making a comment that some consider unsuitable for the position of president and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up on all of this?
Trump said in the voice of his "newscaster" satirically
"I have not given up anything".
He said he was interested in meeting Kim for a second time after his first visit to Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a major step towards making North Korea a nuclear-free nation.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yang Ho, told world leaders meeting at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the US had not "responded adequately" to North Korea's earlier decision to take disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the US is aiming to increase pressure by imposing sanctions.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his recent speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are very good", he said.
"We had the idea of going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were dying.
Our relations are in excellent condition now".
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results, including the end of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers to their homeland.
And when talking about their relationship with Kim, they supported his unusual behavior.
Trump said, pointing his hand directly at the crowd in front of him, "It's easy to be president, but instead of helping 10,000 people from the outside who are trying to get into this crowded space, we'd rather let about 200 people stand there".
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, causing hundreds of deaths.
For example, they were told that after the earthquake in Lombok, there was no need for foreign NGOs.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was evacuated, no national disaster was declared, which was necessary to get international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not need international help, so it is a bit of a challenging matter", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is uncertain whether outside staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of National Disaster Agency, said: Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, it is clear that the country is not prepared to face a natural disaster.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are very rare in coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was known to occur, the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu meant that no fatalities could be avoided.
During normal times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters further complicate transport.
A hospital in Lombok has travelled to the ship Palu to treat the earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure a focus of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Joko is running out of money for re-election next year.
In addition, Joko is also facing the sectarian riots that are raging in Indonesia, where many members of the Muslim community are following a narrow view of their faith.
Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other deadly weapons, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing thousands more.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a spectacular goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge narrowly avoided a loss to Liverpool Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's Football Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London.
With the goal tied 1-0, Sturridge received a pass from Jerdon Shakiri when the team was about 30 yards out from the Chelsea goal.
He tapped it to his left before scooping the ball to a distant post.
His stroke caused the ball to bounce above the box and fall towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed over Kepa Arizabalan's head and fell into the net.
"I was trying to stand in a proper position and take control of the ball and players like Shaq always play the ball as long as possible, so I tried to get as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, but I only touched the ball once and then wet it".
Belgian striker Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute to give Chelsea a 1-0 lead at half-time.
The Blues striker kicked the ball towards Matteo Kovacic before heading to midfield and running towards the liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go in the midfield.
He then threw the ball into the hazard box with great beauty.
Hazard also went to the edge of the post netting and made the ball go through Alison Baker of the liverpool with his left foot.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will face Videotron in the UEFA Europa League, which will be played in London at 3pm on Thursday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The country's disaster agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
The 7.5 magnitude quake that struck on Friday created waves as high as 20 feet and many people were trapped under rubber piles of collapsed buildings, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was filled with rubber debris from collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Burkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
John Street at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds on the body of a 44-year-old woman found near Grayson Muse, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the latter.
Police have requested people in the area of the murder to report any sight or hearing.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its early stages, although I would ask you to contact us if you see or hear anything suspicious on John Street in Birkenhead.
It is also important to ask taxi drivers if they have caught something in the dash cam footage of their vehicle that could provide key information in our investigation.
The woman whose body was found was a resident of Burkenhead and her body was found within the boundaries of a property, a police spokesperson said.
Friends of the deceased woman arrived at the scene this afternoon and are asking where the body was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have been trying to notify the next of kin of the deceased, police said.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose tried to enter his flat but no one was allowed to enter or exit the building, police said.
He knew what was going on there, so he didn't say anything.
Residents will be allowed to enter the building within a few hours.
I heard a police officer telling a person that the whole place is being considered a crime scene for the moment.
A woman arrived at the scene in tears.
She keeps saying, 'It's a terrible thing.'
By 2 pm, if two police vans were inside the cordon or police fence, another van was standing outside.
Several police officers inside the cordon were monitoring the blocks of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by entering log 247 on 30th September.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament is a recent monument targeted for 'creating new history' controversy
Its boycott would have done justice to many of England's cultural and religious artifacts that were destroyed by Cromwell's crazed Puritan followers in a Taliban-style manner.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's advice as "foolish" and "an attempt to twist history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be the subject of controversy to discuss in the current debate on the removal of statues.
The campaign of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Thomas, Cromwell's ancestor of the previous century, may have been unjustly sacrificed for his deeds.
Sir William Hammo Thorncraft represented Cromwell as a mirror to the popular opinion of the 19th century and as part of the historiography of the personality that many believe can still be revered today.
The Lord Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was much more respected in the latter part of the nineteenth century than he is today because he worked to protect Parliament from the external pressures of the monarchy.
But whether it is accurately represented as a whole is a matter of constant historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and it is only true that Cromwell is the only known figure to represent one side of that division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector should be celebrated and remembered".
The Chinese farmer was bitten by a killer pig
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, who was found in a pool of blood in the pigs' stall of a market in Luopan Shui, Guizhou province, was identified only by his nickname "Yuan" and had his arteries cut off, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Xining, Qinghai province, China, on May 30, 2005, a farmer prepared to vaccinate all pigs in the pig farm.
According to one report, he came to the market on Wednesday from the neighboring Yunnan province with his cousin to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found his body and found the door to the next pigsty open.
He told me that there was a large male pig in the pigpen with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a 550-pound pig bit the farmer and killed him, a forensic examination confirmed.
"My cousin's legs were soaked in blood and disfigured", said Jiang, a relative of the deceased, nicknamed "Wu".
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
An hour later, his body was found.
The beast that killed Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
While the police were digging up evidence at the scene, the pig was kept in a cage so that it wouldn't attack anyone, the market manager told Evening News.
The report said that Yuan's family members and marketing officials were in talks to compensate for his death.
Although such incidents are rare, there have been previous reports of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their garden, causing severe injuries to the man's jaw.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig farmer in Wales was trying to hurt his tractor when his wife scared him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally prone to attack, but the taste of blood can "trigger" them.
"They are just playing.
They are very curious, like little children... they don't intend to harm you.
If you give them proper respect, that is enough".
Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest US.
According to the weather forecast, the storm is slowing down, and is heading for the cool waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern US in the coming days.
As of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph, and was seen about 385 miles southwest of Punta Eujayna, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the ring is forming over the Pacific Ocean and heading eastward towards the west coast of the US. On Monday, it will approach the Baja California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, penetrating the southwest US and pushing tropical humidity northward.
Rosa is expected to receive up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidity, which will react with the approaching cyclone, will bring widespread thunderstorms in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain falling in the desert creates dangerous flooding, spilling debris and landslides.
Extreme tropical humidity can cause 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour, mainly in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in the southwest, mainly over much of Arizona.
Tropical rainfall is likely to cause flooding due to the collapse of the conditions.
It is very dangerous to walk in the desert because of the tropical rain.
Heavy rains transform deep ravines into steep-flowing rivers and cyclonic rains produce locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching tropical cyclone will bring locally heavy rainfall to the Southern California coastline.
A little more than half an inch of rainfall may cause some debris to spill and the roads to slip.
This will be the first rain of the rainy season in the region.
Some tropical rain showers will travel to Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, followed by spreading everywhere on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rainfall in all four directions will start on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
Arctic cooling in October will cause temperature fluctuations across the US, but warm weather will continue in the tropics.
Sometimes this will cause a lot of temperature changes at short intervals.
Several temperature variations were observed across the central US on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming few days, the summer heat will continue and spread widely.
The central and eastern parts of the US will start October with warm temperatures and are expected to experience temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
New York City will reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of above average temperatures in the eastern US in the early days of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial was watched by more than 20 million people
The two men's moving testimony was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks, including Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blassy Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political row continued by preventing broadcasters from airing the trial, which was due to end on Friday: This was the result of an agreement with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who had agreed to a one-week hearing on the charges with the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was 100 percent true that someone caught her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
In his strong testimony, Kevano said that it was 100% true that it did not happen.
It is likely to be seen by more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen reported on Friday.
The organization calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available from other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which broadcast the evidence.
And Nielsen usually has a little trouble counting the people who watch in the offices.
In one sense, the number of people watching the trial was the same as the number of people watching a football game or the Academy Awards.
Several people at Fox News Channel have expressed support for Kewano's appointment, Nielsen said, who led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of the court hearing.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, the interest of the people doubled.
Flake was the focus of the Dombrata on Friday.
After a statement from the general Republican office that he would vote for Kewano, he was targeted by CNN and CBS cameras as he entered the elevator to attend the Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday morning, and opponents shouted slogans against him.
He did not look up for several minutes after being humiliated during a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
"When so many women are weak, you are strong", he was told.
Flake said a statement was issued from his office and that he had much to say at the committee hearing before the elevator doors closed.
Cable and broadcast networks then carried live coverage, while the Judiciary Committee was voting to send Kevon to the full Senate for a vote on the nomination.
But Flake said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominees next week at the request of the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially persuaded by the words of his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several senators.
The Flake decision was strong, because it was clear that Republicans could not vote to approve Kevon until after the trial.
President Trump has assigned the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kewano.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with regard to Britain's future and national interest, in the context of her plans to leave the European Union.
Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29th September 2018.
In his interview, published alongside May's interview, which was published on the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, said May's statement that the Chequers had a Brexit plan and that Britain and the EU should collect their tariffs was "completely absurd".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson in connection with LSU player death
Police have arrested a suspect in the case of 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims, who was fatally shot at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Officials released video of the collision between Sims and Simpson and said Sims lost his glasses during the collision.
Police said they found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
Police said that after questioning Simpson, he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer's report, his will was worth $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the death was due to a bullet entering the neck from the head.
The Department congratulates the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and citizens of the area for their cooperation in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Aleva, LSU athletic director, thanked law enforcement in the area for their "diligence and diligence".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
"That's what you're always worried about", Wade said.
A volcano spreads ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after seeing increased activity in the pits and 183 gas emissions and ash over a 24-hour period.
The centre was monitoring many noises and vibrations.
Images on social media showed layers of thin ash coating on car windshields in the neighboring city of Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police in Barcelona on Saturday, and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A mob of masked separatists, who were stopped by riot police, threw eggs and powdered paint at them and created clouds of dust on streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later, clashes broke out again when the police used their batons to control the fight.
For several hours pro-independence groups shouted "forget not, forgive not", while unionist protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
According to local newspaper reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests.
Tensions have risen in the pro-independence region a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but separatist Catalans celebrated it.
The voters in large numbers chose to be independent, although the number of people who came was very small as the anti-separationists largely boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities say around 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to block voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups had camped out late Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The show had to go a different way.
Narcisse Terms, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer confident about the chances of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we witnessed one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are trapped", he said.
Despite hard-fought victories in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties are struggling to maintain their momentum this year as many of their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or detention and await trial for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Jon Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the clash was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"It is getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the oppression of democratic values and the oppression we have faced from the Spanish government", he said.
London terror: People arrested after car breaks into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after repeated car break-ins at a house in Dary, London.
The incident took place at about 19:30 BST on Thursday in Balinagar Crescent.
Death Inspector Bob Blemings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At one point, a CDB may have been fired at the car.
Menga Strike gave Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was a victory
The promoted Livingston Steven Gerrard surprised Rangers by conceding just the second defeat in his 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The strike by Dally Menga made a difference as Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernia in second place.
Gerrard's team is undefeated in the premiership this season and next Sunday they face the eight-point-defeated leaders, Hearts.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against tough interviewees
Halt should have been ahead of the team before he scored, because his straight-forwardness was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but struggled in his attempt when the goal was scored, then Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his effort wide as he slid across the goal to block Craig Holcett's header.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, as they knew they could disturb the visitors at other times.
And the decisive goal came in the same way.
Rangers gave up the free-kick and Livingston scored an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson coming together to face Menger, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers had dominated the parade but the home defense was impregnable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unmolested,
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos snapped a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied a chance by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lythgoe flicked wide from another Livingstone set play.
Crosses came continuously in the Livingstone box and were continuously cleared, but two penalty claims - one after Halcott's challenge over substitute Glenn Middleton and one after the handball - were moved away.
"The most beautiful thing in the world", says the book, "is the way of life".
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony MacArthur Arena
A great performance and result from Livingston.
For one man, he was the best, and he continued to exceed expectations on this upward path.
His style of play and staff have not changed since he returned to the top flight, but Holt has to be congratulated for the way he has equipped the team since his arrival
There are many heroes.
Captain Holcett was immense, leading a well-organized defense to the best of his ability, but keeping Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall always busy.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Sometimes he played as well as he did under Gerard, but he was below those standards.
They were short of the final ball - only once did they break through the home side - and it was a wake-up call for Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29) with smiles and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at fixing relations between the NATO allies.
They disagree on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the inauguration of a massive new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Although the police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, many supporters were there to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - expressed their protest, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These dual protests reflect the division of the audience, which is hailed by some German Turks as heroic and others as despotic.
Deptford road accident: motorcyclist killed after being hit by car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics treated him but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened on Saturday, one mile from the accident site, in Children's Street, after another cyclist died in a hit and run incident a month ago.
He said that the Metropolitan Police is working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Road closures and bus turns have been placed and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lardin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
The prison office said that six prison officers were injured in the incident at the high security men's prison.
A mess broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to contain the riot in one of the cells, which is comprised of eight prisoners.
The officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Special trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and they will spend even more time in jail.'
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The prison governor was reportedly treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner in June.
And in October last year, riot officials were jailed for attacking staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa poses a flash flooding threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (non-area areas may benefit)
Tropical depressions are rare to hit Arizona, but this increases the risks of flash flooding as Hurricane Rosa is likely to drain its remaining strength over the Desert Southwest next week.
The National Weather Service has already released flash flood observations for Monday and Tuesday in southern and eastern Nevada from western Arizona, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, and in southeastern California and Utah.
Rosa is projected to come directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted: "Since 1950 only 10 tropical storms have maintained tropical storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ boundary".
The most recent National Hurricane Center models estimated rainfall of 2 to 4 inches with isolated amounts of 6 inches at the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with the individual amount likely to be up to 4 inches.
For those out of the flash flood risk, the rain of roses can prove to be a blessing as the area is a drought-stricken area.
While the floods are a very serious concern, the rains could be somewhat beneficial as the South West is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drowning Monitor, 40 percent of Arizona's population is experiencing at least severe drought, the second highest category", weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which was still in hurricane strength with peak winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is facing cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore its strength is reduced.
Thus, it is expected to make landfall on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico in the force of a tropical cyclone.
Heavy rainfall could occur in parts of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
"We are expecting 3 to 6 inches of rain from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and it could be as high as 10 inches", weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, and it will move through Arizona and south into Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause deadly flash flooding and debris flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Mid Somer Norton attack: Four people arrested in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and another 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds on the Somer set.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Mid Somer Norton around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is said to be in "stable" condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the area of Rodstock.
The officials have requested anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanagh felt the "wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Justice Kavanagh is a vote to reject the ruthless and extreme tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanagh felt the "wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his certification.
Kavanagh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations that a woman named Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial on his allegations.
On that day, Americans witnessed Kavanagh's "wonder and quality and courage", the president said on Saturday.
"The vote to confirm Justice Kavanagh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished jurists of our time, a jurist with an outstanding record in public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
Speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the President indirectly mentioned Kavanagh's nomination.
"We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
I'm not celebrating, but I'm really celebrating", he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for the best candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats aim to "resist and deter".
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote of the Senate session on Kavanagh's nomination is expected to take place later on Friday.
The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami have killed hundreds of people and the death toll is expected to rise.
At least 384 people died and many more were washed away as giant waves slammed into the beaches when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
As hundreds gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the beach in the early afternoon, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still active on the beach and they didn't run away immediately and they became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNBP, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami not only came by itself but also pulled cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled in the open ocean at 800 kilometers per hour (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
He said some people survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The post-earthquake tremors continued in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
A statement issued by Indonesia's Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said the geography of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Ngroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugraho said the highest casualty and damage could be in the area of Donggala, 300 km (190 mi) off the coast north of Palu, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
"Communications are completely disrupted without any information", said Ngroho from Donggala.
More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse", it said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami to Palu, but officials said the waves hit as soon as the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of the building can be heard shouting loud warnings about an approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, and it pulls buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, and it cut communications around the dam making it difficult for authorities to organize rescue operations.
The army has started sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by cargo planes, officials said, but food and other basic necessities are needed very urgently for the displaced.
The city airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed till October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami disasters are more than 800.
This is very bad.
Donggala World Vision staff have safely reached the city of Palu where employees have taken refuge in tarpaulin shelters set up on their office premises and witnessed scenes of destruction on their way, said Mr. Dosebba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
Some complained that even though aid groups had started serious disaster relief work, deeply skilled foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can be allowed there only if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aliya Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'ok, this is a national disaster,' we can open up for international help but there is still no status on it", he said.
As the second night on the line comes after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones may become miracles that blur the dense story lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the mud next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained the two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Those who were trapped at Rowa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaghi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Jendon recalled that within hours of the news of the Rowa Hotel collapse being broadcast in the paragliding community, he sent WhatsApp messages to the paraglider participants participating in the beach festival in a frenzy.
Their messages, instead of a pair of blue cheque marks, were replaced by a single grey check mark.
"This means that the messages are not being delivered", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM reload at Levi's in Newport
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's workers while they were refilling an ATM in Newport on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more cash, Dett. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was engaged, another man "runs after Brinck's employee" and steals a bag of money dedicated to the delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changed His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "I am officially called Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and used that name for the title of my eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandy.
The creators of the show said that he is replacing singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for emotional reasons.
In addition to being an acronym for his current professional name, West has previously stated that the term has a religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album on radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, that's us.
It has gone from being a single entity to being a mere Y - and it is a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of several famous rappers to have changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West organizer, Jay-Z, also runs with or without hyphens and uppercase letters.
Mexico's Amlo vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that the country will never use military force against civilians as it approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "we will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, as leftist student movements took root across Latin America, soldiers opened fire and killed 300 people during a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the AI funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Although the US does not have a formal AI strategy in place, the notes come after various parts of the US government made AI announcements.
Meanwhile, China last year introduced its plan: it aims to be the No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
"It's a good start to double the AI research budget as all the other countries are way behind the US and we are exploring the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement happening in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, which also invests in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
He worked on the AI system at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, and it beat the American Othello Player, and he later was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee accepted past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next explorers.
Lee said that researchers in the US would have to work harder to win government grants.
"It's not China that's driving the educational leaders; it's the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited scholars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Changes in immigration policy will also help the US to increase its AI efforts, Lee said.
"I think that green cards should be automatically given to PhDs in AI", he said.
The State Council of China released its next generation artificial intelligence development project in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation said that while the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the US are funding people in academic institutions in the same way that they are funding US researchers, the quality of academic work in China is poor.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced it would create a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that was trying to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no progress in several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has been blocking membership efforts for the European Union and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has been claiming the name of its northern neighbor as a claim to its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gorz Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts whether the referendum will meet the minimum 50 percent required for it to be valid.
The question in the referendum is: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by ratifying the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Jorn Javek, argue that it is a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the repression of Yugoslavia, to be able to gain access to institutions like the EU and NATO.
"Today I come to vote for the future of the country, to make it possible for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this is the foundation of a secure life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
He said that while the law does not require it, many MPs are committed to making the outcome of the vote decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
State Election Commission says no irregularities have been reported as of 1pm
However, in the last parliamentary election in 2016, voter turnout was only 16%, compared to 66% of registered voters who cast their ballots, which was 34%.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjos Taniewski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Joran Jave, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, and it will pave the way for NATO and EU membership on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kvarderkov was preparing a small platform and laying chairs in front of tents set up by the referendum boycotts.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", Kvaderkov said.
"We are a poor country but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can be part of the Euro-Asia integration along with others like China and Russia.'
Prime Minister Jave said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour of this as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Jave said after casting his ballot.
He said that the "yes" result is "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday said that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma found that 57 percent of people plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
A referendum needs 50 percent of the people and one vote to succeed.
The failure of the referendum represents the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the whole Brighton defence for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling blasted the defence of Brighton in a 2-0 win for Manchester City in a match at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it very easy in his score, which he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before attacking on the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He went around one defender and then overtook even more people at the end of the Brighton box.
Then when he pushed the pass to the left, there was Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to trick Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan into hitting the right of the net.
"Aguro has some problems with his feet", City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing them for 55 minutes, 60 minutes.
Now it is.
He was lucky to score at that moment".
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the opening advantage in the Premier League bankruptcy.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent a beautiful throw ball to Leroy San along the left flank.
Before taking Sterling to a remote post, San took a few touches
The Sky Blue forward, shortly before the fall, threw the ball into the net.
City will face Hafenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sinnheim, Germany.
Spoiler vs. Scherzer wants to play the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoff contention, there was little interest in another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to fight the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, on the condition that the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, have playoff implications.
The Rockies received a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking forward to their first division title.
Even though we're playing casually, I can point my finger at the rubber knowing the atmosphere in Denver with the people, and other teams may be playing at the highest level I can handle this year.
Why shouldn't I compete in it?
The Nationals have yet to announce another starter for Sunday, but, in such a situation, Scherzer is likely to be allowed to pitch.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, will start the Bull Pen session on Thursday and will take a general rest on Sunday.
Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump leads in West Virginia
On the controversy over his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh, the president indirectly referred to the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done will pay off in November.
The most important election of our lifetime is five weeks away.
This is very important. I am not contesting this election, but it is as if I am contesting the election. That is why I am fighting for the candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing a terrible situation, you're seeing a bunch of hateful Democrats, you're seeing what's happening now.
They are ready to seize power by any means, even if it is inferior.
They ride on anyone they want to get power and control to hurt anyone, they just want power and control.
He said the Democrats were using the "opposition and obstruction" tactic.
"You've seen it in the last four days", the Democrats are "angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest".
He also mentioned the name of Sen. Diane Feinstein, the leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, when the crowd shouted.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the record?
Oh, what the hell.
No, no, no, their body language was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to speak out
When the activists of my local party, Momentum, voted for me, it was really surprising.
So I am the latest addition to the Labour MPs who have dismissed us for speaking our minds.
My colleague, Joanne Rann, has been treated in the same way for speaking out against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censorship board for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on issues of responsible economic policy, national security, European importance, and more.
Nottingham East Labour's Friday meeting notice said: "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
As I have seen in the last eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meeting was held.
Sadly, the tone of the congregation today was not that of most other congregations. The promise of "smooth, seamy" politics has been forgotten for a time.
There is a growing intolerance of dissent within the Labour Party, and every opinion is considered on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It's starting as Jeremy is becoming a leader, whether it's national security or the EU single market, in everything, I, and my colleagues who have shared similar views in the past, are now hoping for a change of stance.
No matter what I say, no matter when I speak in public, there is a barrage of gossip on social media that I should be fired, that I am a disgrace to the politics of the Centre and that I should not be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made about me are politically motivated.
I am amazed at the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues who face sexual or racial violence every day and are not afraid.
The most tiresome thing about politics today is that the lesser amount of violence has gone away.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, we don't have that broad mindset yet, and we're getting narrower with every "disbelief" stance or policy change.
I have received many suggestions over the last two years to keep my head down, not to talk too much and to have a "everything is fine" mindset.
But I have not come to politics for this.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, I have opposed the Thatcher government's neglect of the whole classroom, and it has played a significant role in providing better public service to those in need, whether they are local councillors or government ministers.
I have not hidden anything in my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is in any way confused about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
I would just say to those who supported the Friday position that the country is moving towards Brexit which will affect families, businesses, and our public service, and so I don't see the need to spend my time and effort to show my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But I am not a Nottingham Momentum, but rather a message to the people of my constituency, whether I am a Labour Party member or not, that I am proud to serve you and that no threat of resignation or political favour will deter me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
AYR 38 - 17 Merlows: AYR lead without defeat
Two late attempts seem to have somehow affected the final result, but there is no doubt that AVR deserves an unprecedented win in the Premier Ship Day match of the fabulous entertainment tenant.
They are the only ones who have not lost in the top ten.
In the end, it was his extreme defense and opportunity-seeking that made him successful, impressing the home side and coach Peter Murcie at every turn.
"We have played until now but we have not been defeated. I am happy about it", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose says: "Congratulations to A.Y.R., they have taken better chances than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt was converted by Frazier Climo, sending A.Y.R. forward. However, the yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes turned the game towards Warrior, and allowed Melrose to make the numbers, and Jason Baggott took the unconverted try.
Climo penalised A.Y.R., making a converted solo try to make it 17-5 to A.Y.R. by the time of the break before the half.
However, Melrose started well after the interval, and Baggott's converted Patrick Anderson's try narrowed the gap by five points.
After playing too long, Rawrid Knott was injured and was stretched off, and when the race resumed, Climo took the lead with a converted Stafford McDowell Tri.
The AVR's interim captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again at the end of extreme pressure Bruce Calvin's unconverted try from Melrose had to pay extra man.
McPherson stopped the forward carrying the AVR, as the home side returned from the penalty line out when Struan Hatchin sent a yellow card to the Sun for catching Climo without the ball.
Klimo converted David Arm Strong's box kick to Kyle Rowe, as he had done since the restart, when he sent Greer Henry to the flanker for the fifth try of the home side.
Still Game Star looks forward to new opportunities in the restaurant industry
Still game star Fort Kieran is looking forward to stepping into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been named director at a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, for which he wrote the screenplay and co-starred with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have already announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last, and it looks like Kearnon is thinking about her life after Craigslist.
According to official document listing, he is a director of Adrift Morn Limited.
While sources at the Scottish Sun have said he wants to get involved in Glasgow's "Thriving Restaurant Trade", the actor has declined to comment on the news.
'The sea is ours': Bolivian island hopes court can reopen route to the Pacific
The Navy is guarding the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Sea-blue flags are flying over government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are committed to the motto: "The right to the sea is ours.
It is our duty to take it back".
The island of Bolivia ceded its coast to Chile in a 19th-century war. Thus, Bolivia's desire to navigate the Pacific remains.
This expectation is probably the highest in the decade. After five years of trial, Bolivia is looking forward to the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1.
"Bolivia has the spirit and mission of integrity and thus, expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Bolivians across the country watch the ICJ ruling on big screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule after decades of negotiations that Chile should negotiate the transfer of sea authority to Bolivia.
Bolivia's popular president, Evo Morales, who is seeking re-election next year amid a contentious struggle, is also very optimistic about Monday's decision.
"We are close to the process of reclaiming the Pacific Ocean", he said in August.
However, according to some analysts, it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and even if the court does, the change that could occur is very small.
The UN Council in the Netherlands has no jurisdiction over the Chilean territory and cannot predict the outcome of any negotiations.
The ICJ's ruling comes six months after the end of the final argument, and Chilean international law expert Paz Zarate said that "this case is not complicated".
The situation of the last four years has not been in line with Bolivia's mission.
"The Bolivian administration has hijacked the problem of access to the sea", says Zarate.
She says Morales's statements have lost the respect that remains for Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate in one scenario, but after that it will be very difficult to negotiate.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
The representative of Bolivia at The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltje, has rejected the accusation that the court's decision-making process is suspiciously fast.
"The verdict on Monday will provide an opportunity to forge a new relationship with Chile and end 139 years of mutual disagreement", he said.
Caledilla denies that Morales, still the most popular president in Latin America, is using the ocean issue for politics.
"Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean will never be given up", he said.
"This verdict is an opportunity to rectify the past".
North Korea says that it cannot achieve nuclear disarmament without trusting the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, said that the country would never destroy a nuclear weapon without first trusting Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made by the two leaders at their meeting in Singapore.
His remarks came amid a statement by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the US expects to resume nuclear diplomacy three months after talks with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a dream that North Korea could be subdued by the US objection to its stance on ending the Korean War while maintaining the embargo.
Without first denuclearizing Pyongyang, Washington is wary of declaring a treaty
Kim and US President Donald Trump both want a second meeting.
But there is widespread belief that Pangong will rebuild its weapons, as it believes that it needs only weapons for its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
A beautiful headpiece unveiled at the Paris Fashion Show is coming to your nearby High Street
If you want to change your hat collection or prevent the sun from scorching you, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled their unique large-size SS19 collection in a striking style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The most bizarre hats this summer were popular on Instagram and caught the eye of designers, including Cat Walk.
Valentino has created a design that is like a canopy with a wide circumference like a wing that embellishes the heads of the models.
Other large-size accessories include a fancy watermelon, a peach hat, and pineapple. However, they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne has also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many attractive masks are like sewn lips and these masks look more like Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One of the creations is a scuba diving gear, snorkel and glasses, and another is a mask-melted ice cream cone.
And if you're really into fashion, you'll find your favorite here.
Style lovers have speculated that it will attract you to your nearby High Street because of its attractive bonnets.
The large size hats are modeled after La Bomba. The straw hat with a two-foot-wide brim can be seen on the head of everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratak to Jo Jowski.
The unpractical cult label hat has caused a huge stir on social media, including catwalks, where the straw beach bag is as big as a swimsuit-wearing model.
The Burnt Orange Raphia Bag includes a Raphia fringe and has a white leather handle. It is the signature product of the Jacquemouis La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Female: "I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive on the High Street by next summer. Designers have made such an impact that it is impossible to ignore the demand for large-size accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are needed by global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence and in 2018 this was further reinforced by another unique test result, which was further enhanced by individual and cumulative success in sports, arts, music and other community contexts.
These schools, which have around 30,000 children in Scotland, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and seek to provide a high quality of service to their children and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare children for higher education, their chosen career and to grow as global citizens.
In the educational sector of designing and implementing school curriculum, we can observe that modern languages are constantly becoming popular and in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to a person in his native language, it reaches his heart.
It reminds us that when we want to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries, we should not rely on English alone.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that the languages with the highest pass rate in independent schools have been ranked first.
68% of the children who studied foreign language achieved a higher grade A.
According to data collected from 74 CIS member schools, 72% of children studying Mandarin have achieved the highest grade A, 72% of children studying German, 69% of children studying French and 63% of children studying Spanish have achieved the highest grade A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland are encouraging foreign language as an important skill for children and young people to have in the future without any doubt.
Languages are now considered as a matter of choice in the Independent School curriculum and elsewhere as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, the most difficult job for employers to fill is that 17 per cent of people lack language skills.
Thus, language proficiency is becoming increasingly essential for young people to shape their careers.
More and more jobs require language skills and this skill has become a necessity in the global world.
Apart from career, if someone chooses to learn a second language, they get the real benefit of having this kind of lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will naturally put a person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75% of them cannot speak a foreign language when they are having a conversation, and only 15% of them speak French in the double digits.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for today's children.
If there are multiple languages in developing countries, it provides a better opportunity for children to find a better job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
While many schools focus on classical modern language, looking at 2020, other schools teach the most important languages to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your children's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools and there will be skilled teachers.
Scottish Independent Schools are specialised in providing a learning environment and no matter what the prospects are, they build an environment that develops the skills necessary to succeed and prepares children.
It is undeniable that language will continue to be the most important factor in the global business environment and this should be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages really need to be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and expertise to the young people of Scotland.
This is the action that needs to be taken.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' expectations for LeBron James' debut against the Los Angeles Lakers have finally come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is yet to be decided.
"It's probably more than one, but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James could play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked what the plan was for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
He said, "At this stage of my career, I don't need the preseason games to get ready.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, and they will also be staying in places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
After his election to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, Trump now aims to win support as Republicans risk losing control of the House in the November midterm elections.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
The time for Trump's West Virginia Wheeling Rally is 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
The Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's trial is likely to be mentioned at the Trump rally this week, a matter that has taken on a delicate nature and is expected to block Senate vote confirmation for those under FBI investigation for sexual misconduct.
But the primary focus of these rallies is to encourage Republicans in the November elections.
So these five rallies next week are seen as a way to encourage volunteers and supporters to protect and expand Republican majority in the Senate and House.
Since controlling parliament is so important to his agenda, Trump wants to enter as many states as possible and thus he will be very busy during the campaign season, a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
The West Virginia Metro News reports that the tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could also invite Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and get media coverage of Pittsburgh.
Trump is visiting West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, after winning the state in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump has tried to help the defeated West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morris.
Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said that Trump's election appearance was not a good sign for Morris.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggled to keep up with expectations, facing the singles on Sunday
After three convergence sessions, the Saturday afternoon quadruple was a must for the Ryder Cup.
The running pendulum was a game changer, but it was a race that the athletes really believed in and competed in.
So, which way does the wind seem to be blowing now?
"They were six points ahead, but now they are down to four, so we are slightly ahead", said Jordan Speeth.
Europe is definitely ahead by four points, with 12 more to go.
Speith said Americans feel they have less air in their side and need to be encouraged by many things. Speith and Justin Thomas have been down all day, each one down from four to three points.
She has played for the Green side of the Speeth Tea and is a leading model.
As they went through the lap, the cheers of celebration could be heard. When they and Thomas were two down, the match went to a complicated stage in all four rounds.
His put was followed by a similar outcry as the one that won Game 15. This indicates that the US team did not go out.
"It shows that you are very worried about your match", said Speeth.
That is why all the players have left.
There are now 18 holes to be completed.
The only players to score more than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird but favorite couple are in fours and they can't go wrong.
The only couple who did not shoot the bogie on Saturday afternoon was Maliyud, who put the bogie away on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and returned at nine o'clock on Friday morning.
The race and the energy they have suggested that the players will win the game on Sunday, and the people are supportive of that. Europe is clearly going to win over Fleetwood or Molinari at sunset at Le Golf National.
In different holes at once.
It is not right to talk about European victory right now.
The morning Four Ball Hero Sergio Garcia short work, played with Alex Noreen, was done by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson.
A bogey and two doubles at the front nine encouraged the Spaniard and Sweden to the hole as never before.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
Fourball and four sum is very interesting to watch because the communication between the pair and the advice they give and the advice they don't give and the changing strategy is important.
Europe as a team played well and had a significant lead on the final day, but this Four-Sum Session showed that Team USA is capable of a dubious fight.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe took a healthy lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead against the United States at Four Balls and Four Sum on Saturday.
The pair, encouraged by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, have now reached four points at Le Golf National, with two wins against Tiger Woods, who are trying to match Talley.
Thomas Bjorn's European is trying to regain the trophy after losing two years ago at Hazeltin. The series is 3-1 as the Americans missed out on the morning Four Ball.
The US proved more resilient in the Fourth Sums, winning two matches, but they were unable to overcome the deficit.
The Jim Furyk side need eight points to hold the trophy from Sunday's 12 singles match.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and they became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four matches after he and Molinari had a spectacular weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four Balls, the American rookie Bryson DeChambouy defeated Woods by an even more impressive 5-4 score.
Woods, who lost two matches on Saturday, was often a specialist, but he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in the Four Balls and Four Sum, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's Four Balls, joined Dustin Johnson and Brooks at For Sum to beat Copper 2-1 and are ranked number one and third in the world.
The road was not easy for Europe, they lost in Paris South West.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
Spain's John Ram and Lan Poulter won 2-1 in the Four Balls and after losing the opening two holes, the Four Summoners defeated Poulter and Rory McCall Roy 4-3 in the Four Balls.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup, the team has been four points short in singles.
After two days of being the second favourite, it seems that every attack on Sunday is more than this.
North Korea has said it will not destroy weapons for any reason without confidence.
The ban violates his faith in the United Nations and in such a situation, North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday, it is not possible to destroy their country with nuclear weapons on their own accord.
Speaking at the annual UN session, Ri said North Korea has taken many good steps in the past years, including halting nuclear and missile tests, shutting down a nuclear test site and pledging to halt nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we have not received any response from the US on this", he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in such a situation we will not spontaneously destroy nuclear weapons first.
Ri spoke of Washington's complaint about its resistance to the proposal to phase out North Korea's nuclear weapons, and his statement that he is not as strongly opposed to the demolition of nuclear weapons as he has been in the past.
Citing a joint statement issued by the current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, Ri said Kim has vowed to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and Trump said the US is committed to North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to sing the formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang first destroy its nuclear weapons.
The United States has refused to lift the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US is encouraging nuclear disarmament first, but increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal. Moreover, the US is also objecting to ending the war", Ri said.
The dream of those who do not know us is that we are on our knees because of the ban.
But the problem is that continuing the restrictions is increasing the trust gap between us.
Ri made no mention of the second meeting between Kim and Trump, as cited by US leaders at the UN earlier this week.
The Minister highlighted three talks between South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Kim in the last five months, saying: "If the main actor in this denuclearization proposal were not the United States, but South Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a complex stage".
However, the tone of the speech this year was completely different from last year's at the UN, which was caught in a dilemma when the evil President Trump called Kim a suicide-proof rocket man after North Korea targeted the US with its rockets.
Trump, who said last year that he would "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage in denuclearizing it, but said there was still much work to be done and the ban would continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for it, saying it would take two years, three years, five years, that's not a problem.
China and Russia have argued that Pyongyang should be awarded by the UN Security Council for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "We must continue to vigorously enforce the Security Council sanctions until we know fully, finally, about the verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but this last visit has not been good for him.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, as he was reprimanded for making "pirate-like demands" on North Korea in a matter of hours.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate steps".
Kim said that in addition to the security assurances given by Trump in Singapore, he was looking forward to "conforming measures" and was interested in continuing good relations with Washington.
Harvard students taking a course on getting enough rest
A new course is starting this year at Harvard University to tackle the growing macho culture in studying undergraduate students who are sleepy from caffeine-fueled "all-nighters".
Students who are educated at the best university in the world do not have the basic understanding of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Seesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first time the course has been offered in the United States.
He was inspired to do this course after giving a talk on the negative impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl asked: 'Why am I being told this all these years later, when I am a senior?'
I was surprised when she said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep,' he told the Telegraph newspaper.
The course, which was first implemented this year, explains to students how a good sleep practice can help with academic and sports performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at Vidyalaya, said that Vidyalaya decided to introduce the course after seeing students sleep deprived during the week.
Long-term courses will include interactive tasks.
One section has a picture of the dorm room where students click on coffee mugs, screens, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insomnia affects sports and the importance of bedtime.
Another section discusses how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about the routine.
We know that it does not change the behavior of students immediately.
Just as you have a right to know the consequences of choosing to smoke, we believe you have a right to know about sleep, too", said Prof. Seesler.
While the culture of boasting about reading all night still exists, insomnia is a growing problem due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students.
He said that good quality sleep should be the secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety in students, and also help avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep keeps the brain hungry and hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Seisler design the course and took one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye opener and inspired him to start courses across the campus.
The next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Students should set alarms for when to go to bed, as well as when to get up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which, Professor Seesler recommends, can disrupt your circadian rhythm and thus cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga goal to defeat Gerard team
The series continued with Steven Gerrard's Rangers losing 1-0 to a goal from Dolly Menga in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win since the February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team suffered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, losing eight points to Hearts, the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders who had left their side.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers, playing without spirit, did not seem to be able to match at any moment.
Rangers are now down to sixth, while Livingston are up to third and only behind Hibernian by goal difference.
Linesman Calum Spence is being treated for a head injury sustained after being hit by a long-range object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team which led Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, had retained the same Livie 11 that he had scored a point from Hearts last week.
Although Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston did much better on the occasion.
Menga's first time was when he had only two minutes to score when he sent lay-off Scott Pitman through Alan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs got the free-kick after skipper Craig Holcutt but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was just hitting at the back post.
Although the Rangers maintained control, their final third game was more of a confidence game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that the quarter-hour mark penalty should be awarded because of the clash between him and Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thompson did not consider Columbia's pleas.
Rangers only scored two first-half shots but Former Eblax goalkeeper Liam Kelly Lassanha was hampered by Coulibaly's header and Ovie Azaria's strike.
The 34th minute starter from Libya may be against the game, no one can disqualify him.
Again, the Rangers failed to counter Jacob's deep set-piece.
When Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield did not respond, waiting for him to pick the manga for a plain ending.
Gerrard switched bowling for Ryan Kent during the break and this had an immediate effect as the winger slipped in Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran over his line to block.
But Livingston continued to play the game that viewers loved with Lithgow and Holcett with big big shots
Holt could have taken the lead in the final stages but McGregor stood to deny Jacob before he headed wide from the Lithgow corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim from a dispute with Jacob but again Thompson walked away.
Panchang: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyser invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, eventually the device became known as the Geyser counter
Since then, the Geyser counter, the main basis of science, has also become the basis of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring the Kaukophon scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can really hear the effects of the radioactive molecules in the minerals.
Evans: "Now, you really are a fool!"
"Hans" Geiser died in 1945, a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But this invention has saved his name.
New cancer vaccine may boost immunity to all disease cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches immune cells to fight and destroy disease
As part of the treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system identify the target cells
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory
They can then re-inject the most common protein for many cancers.
The experimental vaccine is showing promising results in cancer patients.
A woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify disease cells has seen her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory so that they can be given the normal protein HER2 to many cancers, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: 'The results show that we have discovered a very promising vaccine.'
Jay Berzowski explained that HER2 "provokes the progression of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
'Teaching' patients to take immune cells and target them against cancer cells has helped in treating a form of leukemia.
Support for Trump from Kane West, who wore a mega hat after SNL.
It wasn't good.
On Saturday night's live, viewers criticized Kanye West for praising US President Donald Trump and telling him to run again in 2020.
After performing his third song at night at Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Cap, he satirized the Democrat and expressed his support for Trump.
'When I talk to white people, they ask me many times: 'Why do you like Trump, isn't he a racist?'
If I cared about racism, I would have left America.'
SNL opened with a skit by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star satirized Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee investigating allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West's parody was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether West was trying to rock him by posting.
He also said that West is finding it difficult to defend his hat in the background.
'They oppressed me behind the scenes.
He said, 'Don't wear a hat and go on stage.'
I was oppressed!
I was in a bad mood,' he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
And West said, 'Do you want to go on stage in the same spirit?' 'You can't tell me whether or not to wear this Superman cap, I asked you where you want me to go.
Love and see.'
His statements were at least twice denounced by the audience and embarrassed the SNL cast members. According to Variety, one of the cast members said: 'The whole studio was in silence.'
West took the stage as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
Dressed like a Perrier Bottle, West surprised many with his song I Love It.
The conservative group TPUSA supported West. Cadence Turner tweeted: 'For the brave souls: Thank you for performing at the group level.'
But Karen Hunter tweeted, "Simply put, West was as good as he was".
'But I don't believe in supporting someone who says idealism is harmful to my community (buying their music or clothing or supporting their 'art').
They are free.
And so are we.'
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter, 'He has changed his name and his name is now officially Kane West.'
He was not the first person to change his name in this way. Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy or P Diddy also changed their name.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion. Similarly, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later reverted to his original name Prince.
Accused of murder in the Belfast restaurant robbery
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhacamore, police said.
The accused will appear before the Magistrates Court in Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will review the allegations.
The game of thrones star kit harrington sparked a war against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington, best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is annoyed by the concept of macho hero and said that because of such characters on screen, boys often face the situation of thinking that they will only get respect if they are determined.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said, "I feel something is wrong". He said that in today's #MeToo era, action is needed against toxic masculinity.
Kit, who is married to fellow Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, 31, said he intended to express the matter.
He felt that something was wrong with masculinity, even though he personally felt strongly about it.
'What do we teach boys as they grow up, and does this have anything to do with the problems we face today?'
He said that the growth of toxic masculinity was due to television and its male characters.
He continued: What is inspiration and learning?
What is it about TV, the things on the street that makes young boys think they're men?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time. How can we change this?
The truth is, something is wrong with young boys.'
He said in an interview that he would not be bothered about any Game of Thrones when the sequel ends next summer. He said that the battlefields and horse scenes were boring.
From November, Kit will star in the next installment of Sam Shepherd's True West. The story is about a filmmaker and his bandit brother.
He said he wanted to meet his wife Rose to get out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show, so in this way it provided me with my future family. From here my life was different,' he said.
Rose Kit played the role of the love interest Wigrit in John Snow, a fantasy series that won an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate
HIV/AIDS: China has seen a 14% increase in AIDS cases
China has increased the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
More than 8,20,000 people are living with AIDS, officials said.
More than 40,000 cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The most significant change is that the majority of cases are due to sexual contact.
Traditionally, blood transfusions have been the cause of the rapid spread of HIV in China.
Chinese health officials in Yunnan state said that the HIV outbreak has been almost eliminated.
Year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In China's LGBT community, HIV transmitted through sexual contact is a serious problem.
In China, homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community continues.
The reason for this is the traditional values of the country. Studies show that about 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Diseases are spread by not using proper precautions in such relationships.
Since 2003, China has provided comprehensive access to HIV medicine to eliminate this problem.
Maxine Waters, who says GOP senators have not leaked information, attacked for 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy charges'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday protested allegations that one of her staffers had posted personal information on the Wikipedia pages of three Republican senators and lawmakers.
He said right-wing pundits and websites are spreading propaganda about it.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that "lies, lies and more egregious lies".
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee of South Carolina and Arin Hatch of Utah.
The information, which appeared online on Thursday, was posted by an unknown person during the Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill.
The leak came shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative sites Gateway Pandit and Red State reported that the IP addresses suggested that the source of the posts was Waters Office and that Waters staff members may have published the content.
'This anonymous allegation is completely false and malicious,' Waters said.
He said, "My staff members, their identity, safety are all exposed due to these fraudulent and false allegations.
He said, "This anonymous allegation is completely false and malicious".
Waters's statement immediately sparked online criticism, with former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer among those who criticized it.
'This denial is outrageous,' Fleischer wrote.
This shows that Waters is not eligible to be a member of Congress.
They need not be angry if someone is falsely accused of wrongdoing.
They don't have to be so violent.
He does not have to say that the accuser is malicious.
They should be calm and patient.'
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters's response to the Democrat's criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who appeared to be very upset by Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, shared his thoughts on Twitter.
'This is great news if true,' he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that the fraud claims have been reported to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies.
'Whoever is behind this plot will be revealed,' Waters said, adding that 'those who have taken destructive and dangerous actions against my staff will be held accountable for their actions under the law.'
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Spy film by Rowan Atkinson
The British film industry is not without its Brexit themes, which are also a major theme in the comedy series Johnny English. The series, which began in 2003, was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a satirical self-parody of the fact that we have obviously done poorly as the nation's new exporting powerhouse?
In any case, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English is licensed to update his material for the second time - a name that above all suggests he's designed comedy for non-English speaking cinemas.
He was of course a Daft secret agent, and despite his eccentric pretexts for glamour he was somewhat of a bully, contributing his earliest notes to Mr. Bean's rave and a note from the Charities of Fire theme tune at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was originally an international figure of the mysterious Actinson who appeared in the now-forgotten Bark Cleckard TV commercials, and who has caused confusion among the public by waking up.
There are one or two happy moments in this recent visit of JE.
I was really impressed when I approached Johnny English's helicopter, and saw the medieval suit he was wearing and the rotor blade swirling around him.
Atkin's Son, gifted with physical gestures, was now being performed, but the comedy seemed powerless and eccentric, especially when compared to "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible.
I think the humor in it was more targeted at children than adults, and I felt that the misdeeds of Johnny English's Illupeilla were not creative and focused, and focused on the depths of Bean's personality in the manner of Atkin Son's silent film.
Now the more topical premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret web network, exposing the identities of all UK agents in the field, much to the disappointment of the agent officers on duty.
This will be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a brazen and courageous figure, already suffering from complete meltdown from political infamy: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Theresa-May role but there is nothing much to work on the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since each of the secrets has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
What this means is that Johnny English, now working as a schoolteacher in some luxury establishment, is being overwhelmed, but giving clues without a record of how to operate in secret: some of the best jokes of this are providing a rock-type academy of English espionage.
English is brought back to White Hall for an emergency explanation and merged with those long suffering from side kick-backs, again conducted by Ben Miller.
Beau is now a married man, and has hit on the submarine commander, in which he plays the role of Joly-Hawkey-Sticks, in which Vicky Pepper Din is a bit of a waste.
Haggy Batman and Robin have made terrible mistakes in Her Majesty's Secret Service, where they face off against Olga Kurylenko's beautiful feminist fatal Ofelia Bulletova.
Moreover, the Prime Minister is in danger under a charming tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: Sinister Jason Volta, managed by Jack Lacey.
English and Beau begin their act of satirical hi-zinks disguised as waiters who set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle in on Volta's luxury yacht; and Volta triggers pure English anarchy to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of the house.
In that last sequence, all the stops are definitely taken out, but it is friendly and lively.
It's a moderate thing.
And I couldn't think of any other Johnny English films: Couldn't the British film industry really do Rowan Atkinson a role that did justice to her talent?
Britain is working on a four-day week but plans to pay for five days, but workers are refusing
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but being paid for five.
The party wants the savings made by company bosses through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to be passed on by giving an extra day off to employees.
This is where you see employees enjoying three days - the weekend - yet taking home the same amount of pay.
The idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favour of workers, sources said.
The Trades Union Congress has approved the change to four days a week in line with the benefits of the changing economy.
Labour Party senior figures told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'Such action will not happen overnight but the four-day working week is an aspiration of the party to balance the economy on behalf of the workers and to align with the party's overall industrial strategy.'
As the Green Party pledged a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign, Labour would not be the first to endorse such an idea.
However, this ambition is not fully endorsed by the current Labour Party.
As one Labour Party person put it: 'Four-day work week is not party policy and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell held a labor conference last week to work to dispel the vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that the decision has been taken to return power from 'faceless directors' and 'beneficiaries' in utilities.
Shadow Chancellor Plans Current shareholders in water companies may not get their full stake back, as the Labour government can 'cut back' based on perceived wrongdoing.
He secured a plan to create Inclusive-owned funds to include workers on company boards and private sector organisations to transfer 10% of shares to employees, who would pocket an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lind Say Graha, John Kennedy says "60 Minutes" could change his mind if the FBI's investigation of Kavanagh is successful.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, and the bureau's findings raise questions about whether any Republican senators will be motivated to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelly asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could catch anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"That is, whatever", Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to trial, I spoke to Judge Kavanagh.
After this happened, I called them, the charge came out, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unambiguous".
However, Graham's resolve was firm as a stone.
"My mind is formed on Brett Kavanagh and it takes the charge of dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it, referring to Christine Bresley Ford.
"And none of those who were named could question them.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see any new changes".
What is Global Citizen's Day and have you done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Civic Festival, an annual music event that features a star-studded show and an equally impressive mission: Ending World Poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Civic Festival will take place on Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also raise awareness about the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, as stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concerts had to complete a number of tasks or volunteer, email the world leader, make a phone call or whatever other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has global civilization been in 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the thought act of rewarding people with a free concert the real way to persuade people to call or another case of what's called "click vision" - do people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Civilization claims to have documented more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, with different goals.
These actions have helped to inspire world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion, aiming to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the start of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the safe funds have directly affected around 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments of Nutrition in the Global Citizen include a Russia-based partnership "to help raise children of stakeholders and their implementation" that promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the Russian government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", said Tracy Ullman, Power of Nutrition Ambassador, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
After the Russian government took more than 5,000 measures to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions, the group said.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website, "How do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's answer: "It's a very long and difficult path - sometimes we stumble and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that lie ahead of us, we will succeed because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Card B, Janelle Moni perform at this year's event in New York, which is hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use navy as "blockade" to disrupt Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed that Washington will use its US Home Fleet "if necessary" to hide Russian power in markets including the Middle East, as the Washington Examiner has said.
Zincke accused Russia's involvement in Syria, particularly at the invitation of a legitimate government, of being a pretext for exploring new powerful markets.
"I believe they want to be a mediating power in Eastern Europe, in the south-central part of Europe, because they are in the Middle East", he said.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"With our Navy, the United States has that capability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and blockade if necessary, to make sure that their power doesn't go to market", he said.
Zincke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Power Alliance, which describes itself as the "voice of consumer power" in America.
He went there to compare Washington's approaches when dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is more or less, to control and replace the fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "a clever horse" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has replaced Russia with an intention to export its liquefied natural gas to Europe, a much cheaper option for European customers.
To that effect, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unconventional" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, was Berlin's "prison" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is poised to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of dishonest competition.
I believe that after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, we share the view that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cannot be a pressure-pulling tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.
The US position has been rebuffed by Germany, which has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had a big problem when the third state interfered in our energy supply", said Dieter Kemf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren "worked hard" when she ran for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would face running for president after the midterm elections with "hard work".
At the town hall in Holyoke, Mass., Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's about time women went to Washington to fix our broken government and the issue of women being better positioned", she told Hill.
"After November 6, I will work hard to run for the presidency".
During the Town Hall, Warren pressed President Donald Trump, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has spoken out against criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote.
A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's units do not think they should be competing in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters have stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of people supported such a contest.
A poll of the race conducted by former Governor Deval Patrick showed high support, with 38 percent of people having a potential run and 48 percent support.
Other top Democratic names discussed regarding the 2020 possibility include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Trump meeting with track Palin called PTSD by Sarah Palin out of office
Track Paulin spent a year in Iraq after joining on 26 September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son is doing, what he's doing after he gets back, I can relate to other families who are experiencing PTSD intensity and the families of our soldiers who have come back injured", he told the audience at a meeting for Donald in Lusa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called their detention the "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back with a firm mind, they wonder respectfully what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have contributed to the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic assault, domestic violence against a female, interfering with a domestic violence report and seizing a weapon during a domestic violence report and rape, a spokesperson for the Dussnett Wasilla Police Department said.
18 States, D.C. Support for new asylum policy challenged
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to those fleeing robbery or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a brief petition Friday in Washington by friends of the court to support those seeking asylum by challenging the policy.
The full name of Grace v. Nassi Plaintiff, the August lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She told her partner that she was abused by the children of his violent gang members, but US officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys from states that support Grace, including El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, explained that it creates a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, with the nations facing widespread problems with robbery and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who had not fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law", as District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday.
"All asylum claims must be determined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances under federal law, and such a listing would violate that principle", the court's friendship summarized.
The attorney briefly argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they were likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions Immigration ordered the judge to no longer provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic abuse and mass violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of exploitation or fear through race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said of the June 11 policy.
There will never be an asylum to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day, even the most serious ones.
Desperate rescue efforts in the wake of a race to find survivors, with the death toll doubling
For the survivors, the situation was even more dire.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fevered son at a centre for the relocation to the city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances are bringing bodies.
Clean water is very scarce".
The residents returned to their destroyed houses, picked up their submerged household items, and found a picture of whether any were worth using.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were flooded by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwai Harris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, were rested outside the Paluvi Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to lack of space.
He was crying with his wife and children, telling them that the earthquake shook his fifth-floor hotel room.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck to the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had gone for a wedding and was in town.
"My wife was begging for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'intimidating' through propaganda ads
After a Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily describing the benefits of the Sino-US trade relationship, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US media to achieve its goals.
US President Donald Trump has accused the paid Chinese daily supplement appearing on Iowa's best-selling daily Des Moines Register on Wednesday of being an attempt by China to influence the US congressional elections, which begin on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US election is part of an effort to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
It is common for foreign governments to run ads in newspapers to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war and are poised to take action by raising taxes on goods sold to each other.
Chinese and American manufacturers have said that China has imposed tariffs on American manufacturers in a way that is more in line with exporters in states like Iowa, which has supported Trump's Republican Party.
According to Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and long-time governor of Iowa, and a major agricultural exporter to China, China has overtaken American workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, 'China is now trying to cook its own meal by advertising in our free press.'
"The American tradition of free press has allowed China to cook the beans, as evidenced by the advertisement in the Des Moines Register", writes Bransted.
"By contrast, if you visit China, you will not find any comments against the economic crisis in the Beijing newsstand, where the media is run under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
"One of the major Chinese newspapers was reluctant to publish my article", he said, without naming which one.
Analysts warn Republicans who are turning away women voters over Kavanaugh
As Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, is being defended by several top Republicans, analysts warn that he will face stiff opposition from voters, especially women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment is so high that most Republicans are officially saying they want to vote.
There is no going back on those things", said Grant Richer, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Senator Jeff Flake said he doubted that trying to get the FBI to investigate at the last minute would be enough to anger angry voters.
"Women may not be able to forget what happened yesterday - whether it's tomorrow or November", said Carine Jean Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MovOn, in a Washington, D.C., newspaper interview.
Protesters demonstrated in the Senate's hallway on Friday morning, chanting "November is coming!" Meek reported that despite the fact that Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination, Dr. Christine Blasey's statement was ignored.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is unprecedented", said conservative political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
"They are saying,' This is a miracle, 'and it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among women who change their party and young voters aged 18-29 living in suburban areas, who don't like the president and who often don't vote".
Analysts said before Ford's public statement on the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee that the Republicans could face stiff public opposition if they continue to pursue the nomination.
"It's complicated at the GOP level", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets to sit on the bench, but how the Republicans handled the matter and looked after her", Guy Siccil, director of Priorities USA, told a news channel.
Americans seem to be a little confused about the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, and most seem to be a little in favor of Ford.
A new poll by YouGov found that 41 percent of people believed Ford, while 35 percent believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of those questioned believe that Kavanaugh lied during his trial, compared with 30 percent who believe that Ford lied.
After Flake's case was brought forward, Ford's allegations are currently being investigated by the FBI. Several other charges have been filed against Kavanaugh, including one by Deborah Ramirez.
Ford has accused the Senate Judiciary Committee of sexually assaulting him while he was 17 years old.
Rumirez alleged that Kavanaugh had displayed his penis at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web search engine is sold to Google and Facebook
World wide web searcher Tim Berners-Lee is set to launch a new startup to take on Google, Facebook and Amazon.
A technology legend, Lee is set to build Solid, a new project called Inrupt, an open source platform.
With Solid, users can control where data is stored and who can read what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind Inrupt was to worship the world.
"Let's do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic occasion".
Using solid technology, people can create their own "personal online data store or pod".
It provides contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It works like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all in one browser at the same time.
The unique aspect of Personal Online Data Store is that it is entirely user-related.
The company calls this 'Personal Empowerment through Data'.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, methodology and skills to make Solid available everywhere.
The company currently has a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a developer staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking about introducing a way to suddenly change the way Facebook and Google do business.
"We don't have to ask their permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee said that "Inrupt's mission is to build a commercial powerhouse and ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
He pioneered a revolution in the Internet with his invention of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been one of the most influential voices in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute, even when he launches Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said he was very optimistic about the future of the web.
Bernard van: Memorial to the Victorian Cross winner of World War I
The priest, who was a recipient of the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I, was commemorated on the 100th anniversary of his birth.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann was a recipient of the Victoria Cross for the Battle of Bellength and Leighcourt on 29 September 1918.
But four days later he was shot dead from behind the scenes, not long before he was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest military honour.
His grandchildren unveiled the memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that it is truly symbolic to erect this stone in his memory 100 years after he received the Victoria Cross.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van moved his battalion to the Canal de Saint-Quentin, as the fog of traffic spread and enemy machine guns shouted unnecessary fire".
He then went to the battlefield and showed great bravery. He was at the front of the battle and single-handedly used a field gun to repel three enemy guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was shot dead by a German attacker from behind the scenes on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of World War I.
"I can't replicate what my grandfather accomplished in his life", says Michael Van, 72, "but I can be very humble about it".
After the military drill, he and his brother, Dr. James Van, laid the foundation stone. The event was organized by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said, "It is an honour to be here today and to honour the heroism of the outspoken hero, which has been warmly supported by so many people".
MMA fans who waited all night to watch Belator 206 got Peppa Pig
You stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 but you don't get to be on the main program. Imagine this situation.
The San Jose Bill had a total of 13 fights, including six on the main card and it was shown live overnight on Channel 5.
At 6am, Gerard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were getting ready to fight, but it was a shock to UK fans when Peppa Pig took over the coverage.
It was natural that some of the audience, who had waited till morning for this fight, were angry.
A fan tweeted about the cartoon show saying it was a "bad joke".
"The 6:00 a.m. fight performance was not appropriate in line with government broadcasting policy, so they had to air the children's show", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications.
"Peppa the Pig, yes".
Scott Cocker, President of Bellator, said that he will be planning the event in the future with the UK audience in mind.
"Perhaps I think we can adjust the replay time in a way that fits the UK", Cocker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning. But we can't set it until our Sunday time, which is their Monday time", he said.
However, we are trying to correct this.
Yes. They were all angry when we had to stop the broadcast. There was a shower of messages.
We are trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical problem.
But this is not the case, they are following the government's instructions.
I can only assure you that this will not happen next time.
We can bring it to five fights instead of six fights, we used to do five fights, but we were wrong to expect that our fans would have one more.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly's humiliation of sex
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he feels humiliated by his sexuality, but that it also motivates him to achieve and succeed in the future.
He didn't realize that everyone was different until he was 24 years old and in secondary school.
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren LaVerne, he spoke about gay rights to provide hope for others.
He said that parenting has made the Olympics less of a concern.
Kirsty Young, who was a regular on the show, took several months off.
Daly, who appeared as Cast Away on Laverne's show, said that while he felt inferior, it was not considered normal to like boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, feeling inferior or different has given me the strength to succeed".
They wanted to create an environment where no one would care if they wanted to achieve something and even know about their sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT campaigner, urging more countries to decriminalize homosexuality during the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said that he is happy to live in freedom and works hard to inspire hope in others.
In 2013, it was a surprise to find out that she had fallen in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, a filmmaker from the United States.
Daly married Oscar winner Lance Black last year, who is 20 years her senior, but felt the age gap was not a big deal.
"A lot happened at a young age", she recalls, "when she won her first Olympic medal at age 14. Three years later, her father died of cancer.
The couple adopted a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley. This development completely changed the customs of Daley's way of life.
"If you had listened to me last year, I would have talked about winning the gold medal.
"You may know, there are bigger things in life than Olympic gold medals.
Robby is my Olympic gold medal".
She named her son Robert after her father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 40.
According to Daily, Robert's father never wanted to die. He always asked if he could get a ticket to the London 2012 Olympics to sit in the front row.
"But how can I tell you that you can't be in the front row", Daly asks.
And I said, I will hold them fast, until their breath be taken away; and when they are dead, they shall not be ashamed.
The following year, Daly won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"It has been my lifelong dream to dive in front of my country at the Olympic Games, where I could not be happier than to win a medal".
This inspired her first song choice, Pride by Heather Small, which not only resonated with the preparation of the Olympics but also filled the atmosphere.
Desert Island discs on Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Michaelson lost the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Michaelson of the United States was scheduled to play his 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will need to get back on track to make the milestone.
Michaelson, who is participating in the biennial tournament for a record 12th time, was rested by team captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's Four Balls and Four Sums.
The four-time Major Winner and Cheerleader, who has been performing brilliantly for the United States as well as shining in the Ryder Cup, spent the day focused on improving his game.
The 48-year-old, who was not known for his direct achievements even at the peak of his career, was not a role model for the National Golf Course, which is more punishable for long rough faulty shots.
Although the course is not as challenging, Michelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, winning all four of his matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
Michaelson's performance in the Hot Start will be a major one for the Americans, who have scored four points short of starting 12 singles matches.
Furik said nothing but confidence in his teammate.
"They fully understood what their role was today, they supported me and said they were ready for tomorrow's match with their arms around me", Furyk said.
"They have a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past.
I didn't think they would play only two matches.
I thought I could win more, but it turned out that way. We thought it was the right decision.
They want to be here like everyone else".
Michelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This marked the end of a Ryder Cup career that did not match the height of his personal record.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence has brought some ambiguity to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make people laugh, and he's a good guy on our team", she explained.
The younger players were having fun going to him, and even this week, I think it was fun to watch.

European leader Thomas Jorn says large-scale lead is about to disappear
European captain Thomas Jorn knows from experience that a key lead in the singles match on the final day of the Ryder Cup tournament can easily turn into an unpleasant ride.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros had scored five points over the Americans but only got the finish line to his nose in front of the narrow margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
After watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead in the National Championships of Golf League, you will remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but not only.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Tomorrow will be very boring for everyone.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this trophy, and stay focused there.
I have said everywhere, I will focus on the 12 players in my team, but we know very well what is on the other side: the best players in the world.
It is good to see how his players have performed on the tough golf course, Jorn said: I will not let this continue.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow's upcoming solo shows, and that's another thing to do.
It's good to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're out on your own, your ability as a golfer is put to the full test.
The message is that you should contact the players, you will get better results from them tomorrow.
For now, let your comrades go and they must go and wish the best for them".
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk is performing better than his players as a part-nor, with Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas scoring three out of four.
Furyk himself was on either end of that last trade, Europe was part of the winning team at Brooklyn before ending up a loser as he came out in "Madina at Medina".
"When I was asked how the captain, Ben Crane Shaw, put his players together for the last day in 1999, I remembered every bad word of it", he said.
"Tomorrow we have 12 major matches, but you want to start fast like you saw in Medina, like you saw at Brookline.
When you are fast like that, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
You know, we're going to adjust our line-up accordingly and we're going to raise the boys in the style that we think we're going to, we're going to try to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter facing the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this move, because I think it's going to be covered in every way", Jorn said of his singles options.
The new German battleship was delayed again
The new German Navy fleet was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace Cold War-era battleships, but due to faulty systems and snowballing costs, local media reported that it would not be possible until the following year.
According to Direct newspaper, citing a military spokesperson, the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the "Rhineland-Pfalz", has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but some post-delivery issues have ruined the future of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the Bremen-class battleships.
They are known to contain powerful artillery, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some secret technologies such as low radar, sonar and acoustic signatures.
Other key features include long maintenance periods, deployment of new warships from major local ports for up to two years.
However, due to the constant delays of state-of-the-art warships - which are said to allow Germany to power projects abroad - they will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, Direct says.
The F125 warship apparently refused to be retained as an official German Navy ship last year and made headlines by returning it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This will be the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reason for the withdrawal, but the German media cited several critical factors such as "software and hardware deficiencies" that would render the battleship useless if deployed in combat.
The Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by approximately 120 naval sailors, with software deficiencies that may have a major impact in part - half the manpower used here compared to the older Bremen-class battleships.
Also, the ship has overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project - including staff training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from €2.2 billion initially.
These difficulties are particularly important in terms of acquiring new warships under recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was in fact "dropping out of deployment-capable ships".
The official said that over time the problem grew like an iceberg, as the old ships were scrapped but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class fleet could rejoin the fleet.
The National Trust's survey of the secret life of bats
New research is underway at the Scottish Highlands Estate, aiming to reveal how the baboons use the land for their prey for food.
It is believed that the findings on the unique behaviour of flying mammals will shed new light and guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland followed both normal and soprano pipistrels, including brown long-ears and daubentun bats.
Special recorders are kept at key locations of their movements to track the activities of bats in all seasons.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting surveys on mobile using handheld filters.
The sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of the calls of the bats and what the species is doing.
A habitat map and report is produced to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and will give bats and other related species a better understanding of how to manage wilderness areas.
The population of the baboon has declined considerably over the last century in Scotland and across the UK.
They are endangered by construction and development works, which affect poultry and habitat loss.
Some chemicals in fly papers and building materials can cause damage, as well as wind turbines and lighting can pose a hazard to pets.
The bats are not really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to identify faults and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the Bawali very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who continuously conduct surveys, inspections and sometimes salvage.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only conservation reserve of bats at the Threw Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, said the estate is a good location for him.
"In Thrive, we have a good area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and all good housing.
But we don't know enough about bats, so we are working here and helping to understand more about what they need to do to thrive in other places".
She stresses the importance of screening the bats before conducting site management, as without proper maternal care 400 female species and younger generations were wiped out, possibly the entire population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harm them or destroy their offspring.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Conversation Trust for Bats, has encouraged the public to help.
As he says: "We still have to know about our bats and for many generations we do not know how their populations are going".
Ronaldo dismisses rape claim as lawyers sue against German mag Jean
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape claim against him as "fake news", saying people use his name to "promote themselves".
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was allegedly paid $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram live video with his 142 million followers just hours after the claims were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo said it was all "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what is what is the way that is the way that is the way to do this is the way to do this is the way.
He said that the fake news, five-time Ballalen Devor Winner, was told in front of the camera.
"They will do all this to you because you are my disciples, because you have heard me speak against them.
It is normal.
They are becoming famous using my name, but it is part of the job.
I am very happy and everything is fine, just like another player.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel, which they called "unacceptable reporting on suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Skirtz is seeking compensation for moral damages in the amount "commensurate with the violation, which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada reported that Ronaldo and Mayorra went back to the player's room, where he raped her.
Ronaldo fell at my feet after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent" "good guy".
Records say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had a sexual relationship, but it was agreed.
Mayogra went to the police and gave them photos taken of her injuries in hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she was trying to cancel the settlement now as she was traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and agreed to a €100 million deal with Italian giants Juve this summer.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing its car maker
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "perpetually regret" losing its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it will temporarily halt production at its factory in Barnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a border delay of a no-deal Brexit event could cost jobs.
The Bernaston plant, which makes Toyota's Yaris and Aventis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain is hit by the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", Toyota managing director Marvin Cook said.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without any deal on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its mini-plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The problems of the car manufacturers are that there are risks to the supply chain in the event of no deal in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with spare parts arriving from suppliers in both the UK and EU every 37 minutes.
The industry says that if the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border due to delays and lack of spare parts.
Toyota has said that it is impossible to keep a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, thus halting production.
Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU was "scaled precisely to avoid those checks at the border", Mr. Clark said.
"We need to make a deal. We want to have the best deal that we can, as I say, allow us to enjoy the current success", he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we should be fully capable of continuing the most successful supply chains".
Toyota cannot say how long it will stop production, but warned that in the long run, the extra costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately hurt jobs.
Peter Tzavaleris, who worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is a United Union conveyor at the plant, said that members are more concerned: "My experience is that once these jobs are lost, they can't come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
As the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be pushed back another week", the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating ties between Trump aides and Russia and obstruction of justice by the president, due to Russian election interference.
Whether Trump will take down the deputy attorney general and endanger Mueller's freedom for it has been a matter of months in the Washington airwaves.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House last Monday, despite reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't prefer" to shoot Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanagh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual abuse, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanagh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "There is no date set for that, it could be this week, I can see it being pushed back another week given all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we see it and I always want to keep the press updated".
Some reporters contest that claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
The reason for not calling the press conference, according to Sanders, was not a lack of desire to draw attention. Rather, he explained why: "I don't disagree with the fact that they do".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any other president", he said, without citing evidence. "We've seen numbers like that".
Briefings still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's more limitless than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of that and you've seen us do a lot of that over the last few weeks and when you talk to the president of the United States, it's going to be at a press conference.'
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting elites.
Solo press conferences are very rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated with reporters who were probably freewheeling and sometimes oddly-looking.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express gratitude for the country and to the position they want to be in post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter from the UK with less than six months until the EU withdraws.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its improved public services.
In her letters, Ms Freeman wrote: "As the summer is over, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal are ongoing, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is stepping up its preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know that this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That is why I would like to emphasize how much I respect the contribution of each staff member regardless of their nationality.
We bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, benefiting our colleagues in the EU and beyond, and the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would very much like you to stay".
Kristen Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Aber Crombie has undergone emergency surgery for a concussion in his head following a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Speaking to reporters, Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, said the injury occurred half an hour earlier.
"They came to the party, what a fall", Reid said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen before putting him on a stretcher and returning him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of the WS MV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Aber Crombie was out of surgery at the Wonder Built Medical Center.
Harris "has no details yet on the extent of the injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Harris "has no details yet on the type/scale of injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Under the new Tory schemes, foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK with extra money to be used to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of the Carbin drive to attract young voters
Stamp duty increase will be charged to non-taxpayers in UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty rates when buying property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide affordable housing to young voters and target the highest earners.
The Government has also announced that the UK will impose a stamp duty increase on non-taxpaying individuals and entities, and a further increase on non-taxpayers.
The additional fee - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, includes the higher levels introduced in second homes two years ago and the opportunities to buy - could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million annually with this move.
Non-UK residents are buying up to 13% of new properties being built in London, which is driving prices up the ladder and making it difficult for first time homeowners to own their own roof.
A large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, which has turned many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - into "ghost towns".
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction firms of stealing land and driving up property prices by not using it, and urged Mrs May to scrap her quota of affordable housing to remedy Britain's "housing scandal".
Mr. Karbin has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rental control and ending of "no-fault eviction".
He demanded that the councils be given more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring the British love - to make life better for every new generation.
This means that we have to fix our fragile housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be said that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign-based companies are as easy to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For many, home ownership has become a distant dream, and the miserable life of sleeping on the streets is a reality".
Jack Rose: 'Managing Scotland is my ultimate ambition.'
Jack Rose, head of Sunderland, said it was his "ultimate ambition" to become a Scotland manager at some point in his life.
The 42-year-old Scott, who has eagerly accepted the challenge of reviving the North East club, is currently in third place in League One, three points behind first.
He is returning to the Stadium of Lights this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and it's like this", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my dad in Hampden from a young age, and that's always something that binds me.
He said that I will only get the opportunity if I am successful in managing the club.
Previous Sunderland managers who have preceded Ross include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Cano.
The former Aloha Athletic boss said he had no qualms about joining such established names at such a large club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only criterion for this time is how I can get this club back into the Premier League.
The structure and facilities at this club make it a Premier League club without a doubt,' he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I think if I can get the club back there, I'm successful here".
Ross has been in the management profession for only three years, having served as assistant head at Dumbarton and as a coaching staff member at Hearts for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa to recover from a third-place slide. By the following season, he had transformed St Mirren from relegation to championship title-winner.
Rose says he feels more comfortable now than he did in the past with careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a really dark time", he recalled of his time in Aloha.
"I honestly believed that management was better for me than playing.
It seems strange, because I have done the job well, and I have earned enough, and I have reached enough heights.
But playing is really hard.
Once a week you have a lot of work to do.
I cannot escape it in terms of the stress and pressure of work, it will continue. However, the management work seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage, and I'm doing it now, and I think it's the most comfortable thing I've ever done in my entire adult life".

The poll says the best time to pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat has boosted the sales of struggling UK pubs, but at the same time, it has added pressure on the restaurant chain.
Pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 per cent in July - while restaurants saw sales fall by 4.8 per cent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy `CGA`, which compiled the data, said: "Due to continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation, pub sales were up 2.8 per cent in July compared to the previous June, but restaurants faced even tougher days.
The 1.8 per cent decline in restaurant turnover in June was further intensified in July.
Pubs and bars, which are mainly selling beverages, have performed better than restaurants in terms of business.
Although the sun's heat is also affected at festivals where food is the main ingredient, it is not as severe as for restaurant owners.
People seem to want to go out drinking.
Alcohol sales in the managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent monthly, while food sales fell by three per cent.
According to Paul Newman of Leisure and Hospitality Analysts `RSM: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to outdoor or out-of-home market sales, the influence of weather and major social or sporting events remains the biggest determining factor.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to be in constant distress, as, while sales are declining by 4.8 percent year-on-year, on the other hand, operating costs are rising.
This long summer should not have come in days when the main food restaurants are struggling. Time will tell if the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed relief".
The total sales growth of all pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened in July, was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slowing of product launches by brands.
The ̋Coffee Peach Tracker' is now an established industry benchmark, collecting and analysing performance data from 47 management teams that monitor the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry's sales totalling over £9 billion.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that their parents do not know about
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts, unbeknownst to their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake Instagram" pages
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are secretly creating social media accounts without the knowledge of adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake Instagram" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account, which is "pure" and "show parents" and also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret location of her 13-year-old daughter claims that the teenage girl insisted on social media that she "rape me".
In research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40 per cent of children aged 11-18 said they had two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
As HMC chief Mike Buchanan says: "It is alarming that many teens are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Elid Doyle is the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elyd Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most popular track and field athlete. President Ian Beatty, who commended his selection, described it as a great opportunity to leverage Elide's extensive experience at the international level over the past decade to guide the sport.
"Elid is held in immense respect throughout Scotland, the UK and the world athletics community, and I am confident that bringing him on board will greatly benefit athletes in Scotland", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be a voice for the athletes and I think I can really contribute to the direction of sport in Scotland".
The American, who won four gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, is now a regular on the BBC. But he has been unable to walk since he was diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago on this day, I suffered a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors told me that only time could tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was hard work, but I made a full recovery. I learned how to walk again. Today I'm doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Pro-opposition to breast pump advertising that compares mothers to weasels
Both these views have been expressed online against the breast pump company's advertisement comparing mothers to daughters.
Consumer tech company LV has launched the world's first silent wearable breast pump, and has released a music-laced promotional video showing how the new pump gives mothers a chance to express themselves.
Four mothers dancing in a hay shed: Yes, my milk calls, "But you can't see the tail. If you think these are to irritate the breast, you're wrong. These are my breasts".
The lyrics continue: "Pump, pump, I give milk to the children... pump, pump, call it female milk".
The advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has caused a lot of controversy online.
The video has already been viewed by 77,000 people and has hundreds of comments, with mixed reactions from viewers, who said it made fun of the "terrible" dairy industry.
"It is a poor decision to use her for this breast pump advertisement.
The women also become pregnant and give birth; but when they give birth, they are cut off.
The LVB is concealed in the breast pump of the nursing mother (LVB/mother).
Another commented: "I know it's hard for both mother and child.
But why not use this breast pump for advertising for those who have their own children?"
Another said: "It's a nonsense advertisement".
Inaro defended the ad. One woman responded that the song itself was "funny".
"This is a common idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one of these.
It is true that when pumping, one feels like a bum.
The ad may sound a little crazy, but it's also a little true.
It is a genius product.
Another commented: "It is a joke on mothers who feel that they are really the pimps by pumping (in the workplace and in the toilets)".
This is not an advertisement praising or denigrating the dairy industry".
Finally, the commercial shows the dancing women wearing a breast pump inside their bra.
The idea behind the campaign is the insight that many mothers who use breast pumps feel that they are pregnant.
The LVP works completely silently, without any fillers or tubes, and fits comfortably inside the breast-feeding bra. It gives women the freedom to move and pick up their babies.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: "LV Pump is a revolutionary product. It needed a bold and provocative start.
By demonstrating the equality between expressing women and dairy cows, we wanted to talk about breast pumping and its challenges, and how to make the new pump feel independent by telling it in a fun and relevant way.
This is not the first time that LV pumps have appeared on the headlines.

Hundreds of children quietly migrated to a tent camp at the Texas border
The Trump administration's strict administrative measures have made it difficult to provide caregivers for refugee children, and the number of children detained at the border crossing has increased sharply despite the same number of detentions per month.
Traditionally, those who want to raise such children are refugees themselves, and when their lives are difficult, the desire to raise such children makes their existence in the country even more difficult.
The risk increased further in June, when federal authorities made it mandatory for individuals or families who want to adopt children to provide fingerprints, which would then be provided to immigration authorities.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albenz testified before Congress that his agency had arrested dozens of people who had come forward to adopt unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal background.
"Eighty per cent of the individuals are either sponsors or family members of sponsors who have been here illegally and most of them have a criminal background.
So we are trying to catch these guys", Albenz said.
In order to expedite the process, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring children to appear in court within one month of their arrest, compared with the original 60-day rule.
Most of them do not have to appear in person, but instead present their legal status by video call. The immigration judge listens.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be deported immediately.
Children who are detained for long periods of time may be more prone to anxiety and depression, which can lead to violent feelings and a tendency to run away.
Advocates say that such facilities are too numerous to care for children in need, and that the potential for such a large facility like Tornillo is too great.
The tent workers feel that moving children to the tent city without giving them any time to prepare emotionally and even to say goodbye to friends at the end adds to their pain.
Syria says it is ready to surrender to US, French and Turkish forces
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ulem has urged Syrian refugees to return home, amid the ongoing war in Syria, which is now in its eighth year.
Molem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally entrenched on Syrian soil and fighting terrorism is just a pretext for them. He also warned that action will be taken against these forces.
"They must leave immediately, unconditionally", he said.
According to Maulem, the "war on terrorism" in Syria is now "nearly over", with 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue its fight against terrorism and illegal foreign forces until it seized Syrian territory.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training Kurdish and other Arab forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Maullem said that now is the time for them all to return home.
"We appeal to the international community and human rights organizations to allow such returns", he said.
"He is actually doing politics on humanitarian issues too".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no help will be given to Syria's reconstruction unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
The UN ambassadors expressed hope that the talks between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, have created an atmosphere conducive to the start of political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoids the possibility of an attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the state, which is home to millions of people.
The agreement has a "clear deadline" and the Syrian offensive will be directed against all jihadist groups, including the al-Qaeda-backed Nusra Front, which will be completely destroyed, Maullem said.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is hopeful of forming a new committee with members from the government and opposition, which will aim to draft a post-war constitution in Syria and pave the way for elections.
He said that interference is not acceptable in any way, and said that the purpose of the drafting committee should be limited to reviewing the provisions of the current constitution.
Trump will be President again, how?
Trump will lose the presidency if he is not fooled by promises or scandals. According to this logic, Trump will be the president of the United States again in 2020, which is also true contrary to the optimism of most liberals.
This will be the 'most dramatic presidential fight'!"
There is no basis for spectators to settle on this at present.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's ratings have tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" was the top show with 3.5 million viewers.
"It's a trick that's drawing people in. We don't understand what it is", says Neil Baer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor". In this drama, an attack destroys the Capitol, and then a cabinet secretary becomes its president.
The author and senior comedy writer Nell Scavel of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into a Hollywood Boys Club" is different.
He also recalled the cab raid before the 2016 Boston election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" Neal asks.
They said, "They're laughing at me", Ms. Scovell told me.
There is an entertaining part to this confusion.
Of course, more than anything else on TV, the stories coming out of Washington could determine Roy's future, whether immigrant families can be reunited, or whether the global economy can improve.
Change is a luxury that can only be achieved by the most privileged.
Yet watching experts discuss on TV the $15,000 Ostrich leather jacket by Paul Manafort (the Washington Post called it a Garment Thick with Hubris)... watching the implications of Stormi Daniels's account of Trump - that's not enough information for us.
I can't see Super Mario in the same way.
According to Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment, the creator of 'Pawn Stars', it feels like there's a reality show every night. Trump is feeding the discussions, whether it's conflict with the NFL or praise for Kim Jong-un.
He said that even if you miss one episode, you will be far behind.
When I reached Mr. Fles this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was taken inside while watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could balance the future of Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, without being able to face himself.
"I remember we were doing all those amazing shows and people were telling me, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fles said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but then I felt that they were doing the right thing".

Tight midterm election house races are like a spillover
It's no surprise to see Pennsylvania's 17th cash flow, thanks to a rearrangement of congressional districts that lowered the two-candidate-rankings for a single seat.
The recently reconstituted suburban Pittsburgh district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who last won his seat in another district in a special election.
Lamb is currently running against another seat, Republican Keith Roth Fuss, representing the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were reconstructed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally jerrymandered in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th contest touches on the campaign finance slugfest between the major party financing arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after being widely watched in a special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been contested by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats some intensity.
The U.S. sanctioned El Salvador for supporting China, then supported
The diplomats noted that Beijing in Washington had already identified the Dominican Republic and Panama.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and stayed at a Panama hotel until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
"The State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama regarding their future decisions to recognize Taiwan", Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and proposed visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continue, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, a step in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, he made it clear that a conference of top administration officials would proceed, effectively ending any consideration of the penalty for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now addressing a conference scheduled for mid-October, diplomats said, in a sign of importing the administration's positions.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion, as explained by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
His accounts were confirmed by outside analysts close to the administration and he also spoke of a state of anonymity.
The study history
A report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's obstruction of justice may be the next target, which now has plenty of public record evidence.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly changed his investigation into whether the Trump campaign has compromised with Russia in the attack on our elections.
As Mr. Trump prepares to go before the voters again, Congress needs to change hands and finally his colleagues' verdict is final.
It was a lot of things and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable or that he has no equal in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices to make that will affect how long the fight can last.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to stage an uprising against Hitler, only the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the subsequent genocide.
The course of history revolves around such reflection points and the inevitability of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face a number of these conspiracy elements.
What should we do if the man who controls the future of Mr. Mueller's investigation is Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who Mr. Trump is going to take down?
Last year, Rosenstein was canonized since the paper reported that he had secretly filed a motion to dismiss the president and decided that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is not accurate.
"How do we respond to the newly requested F.B.I. Is Brett Kavanaugh's investigation incomplete or unjust or has he been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
And above all, do we vote in the interim for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail such tests, democracy will be in disarray for a long time.
But I hope that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had occupied my embassy.
She survived, then immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
Like my heritage, can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Before the rapid Vienna collision, Rangers Graham Doran was an optimist
Rangers' win against hosts Rapid Vienna, Austria on Thursday, after an impressive performance against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from scoring the first goal in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more.
"It's a joy for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end but, overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
They probably played well in the first half and we came out in the second half and were a better team.
Going into Thursday, it's another great European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it was a tough game and they had a good result in their last match but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can go on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between my injuries and everything that happened with the changes of the club now there is an emotional aspect about the place.
The team is great and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is great.
Hopefully, we can move forward now, we may have beaten us last season and now we have a chance too".
Women are losing sleep over retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves, few talked about it with their family members.
In a nationwide study, half of the individuals said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of themselves but they're not taking steps to engage in the conversation", said Holly Cinder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not congratulate your family in advance, you will not be able to prepare them.
Talk with your counsellor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as such options can play a major role in determining cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to suggest ways to pay for such expenses.
Your future fund options for long-term care may include a hybrid cash value life insurance policy, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, to help save on these expenses as long as you have the money, or to self-insure your property.
Get your legal documents out: Fight legal battles at the pass.
Get a healthcare proxy to know about your medical concerns so you can assign a trusted person and make sure your professionals follow through if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.
If you are unable to make financial decisions and pay your bills, you can choose a trusted person.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
You can be prepared by providing those details in writing.
"It's not just a game of finances, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are drugs?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put that one idea into action".
One man shot several times with an air rifle in Lifracombe
A man was shot several times by an air rifle on his way home at night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Lifracombe, Devon when he was shot, having been hit in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials describe the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the man who attacked him.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
Due to the damaged communications, the relief officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongola Regency in the northern zone of Palu, the area near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palo since the disaster.
Some highlights about Palu and Dongola on the island of Sulawesi are:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a steep bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
The regency of Dongola extends over 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, the administrative region at the bottom of the region, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The major economic backbone of Central Sulawesi is fishing and agriculture, which is the main occupation in the coastal area of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the area, but it is mostly specialized in Morowali, a coastal region opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Relief and Relief Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in Dongola due to a tsunami and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami killed nine people in West Dongola in 1996.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a seismic zone that is constantly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the top earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of North Sumatra in the Indonesian region of Aceh on Dec. 26 struck 14 nations, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Indonesia's most populous island, Java, was hit by a 6.8 magnitude tsunami that killed about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra region.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands of Sumatra, creating waves as high as 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: Once again, as people remember the devastation from the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami, the earthquake hit PD Jaya Regency and caused devastation and terror.
No tsunami has affected this time, but more than 100 people have died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lambook, mostly in the northern part of the island, killing more than 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily disrupted thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska governor Track Palin and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin have been arrested on charges of assault.
A man named Pauline 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reporting and opposing detention, according to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when the woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.
Pauline is being remanded to the Matt-Sue pretrial facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "certainly, not guilty" when his appeal was heard, the network reported.
Pauline faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanor, sentenced to one day in jail and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Pauline.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Pally, was charged with assault.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic abuse, interfering with domestic violence reporting and drug abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior arose from his service in Iraq to PTSD.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of people killed
384 people have died in the earthquake that hit Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication network are disconnected with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Influential videos are floating around on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo, when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors seeking a rare death sentence for suspected NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York have sentenced to death the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, Seifullo Seipov -- the rarest sentence in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is alleged to have used a home depot rental truck to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan.
To justify the execution, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious physical injury, according to the notice of intent seeking the death penalty, filed in the Southern New District.
According to court records, both counts carry the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with the aid of bandits, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and preliminary preparation", with prosecutors describing the procedure in Saipov as "horrible, cruel and fraudulent".
"Sifulo Habilávic Saipov caused injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Anglin, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Lara Decadette, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoz and Alejandro Damián Pagnuko, who were also killed in the attack.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last heard a death sentence.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was accused of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a New York federal case resulted in the death penalty was in 1953 when a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed two years earlier after conspiring to run a church for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, Rosenberg and his wife were executed by electric chair.
The resident of Saipav, Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of compassion in days and months, according to court records.
He said he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipav told the authorities that he was motivated after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He has also pleaded not guilty to the charge number 22.
David Patton, one of the representatives of the Federal Public Defenders representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" with the outcome of the legal action.
"The death penalty instead of life in prison without the possibility of release of any kind will drag on for a long time for everyone involved", Patton said.
The Saipav's bar team had earlier asked the judge not to hand down the death sentence.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit
During a protest at the Tory Conference today, Nigel Farage pledged to 'arm the people's army'.
For saying that she should take charge of negotiations with the EU as suggested by Theresa May's MP - a former UKIP leader who said that politicians from Eurosceptics should 'feel warm'.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have already been left out if Farah had not been Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces a different challenge, she stressed, as the city is in a separate struggle with those who want to stay in the anti-Brexit movement.
The prime minister is struggling to keep track of his checkered compromise plan amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and Europeans.
The Allies insisted that she go ahead with a deal with Brussels despite heavy opposition - and urged Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'disorder'.
Bone said that he wants to do 'Chuck Checkers' at the Leave Means Leave (Leave Me) rally in Solihull.
He suggested that Faraz should be made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If they had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough MPs said: 'I am in favour of Brexit but we need to check the checks.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We did not fight the world wars lightly.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Bonn dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay without Brexit is completely false.'
Tory Brexitist Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, telling reporters: 'My little advice: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Checkers are not popular in the public sector, the opposition does not vote for them, it is not popular in our party and our workers' circle, really these workers fight in the streets and choose us first.
Please drop the checkers and start asking.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she said: 'Prime Ministers keep their position when they keep their promises.'
He said that if the politicians who are rallying are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be 'warmed up'.
"It is now a matter of trust between our people and our political class", he said.
'We are here today to make it clear that they are trying to betray Brexit and we will not let them do that.'
In a message to the excited crowd, he said: I want you to warm up our political class that is betraying Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we make our country an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group started this weekend, activists blew Tories against Brexit banners.
Labour Peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives on the security issues he experienced on the party app as the conference began.
'These people will tell us that we can have IT systems with Canada etc etc and have all the technology with Ireland, frictionless border and open borders for free trade etc,' he said.
'This is a complete travesty.
There is no better thing than Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to make a 'hard decision' to run for President of the United States
"I will make the tough decision to run for president", said Senator Elizabeth Warren after the U.S. election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future actions at the town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Jeff Dahl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might defeat Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting he has held with the units using the Town Hall format since Trump took office.
The people present at the meeting asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in a high position", Warren replied.
The Sims murder of the LSU team - the killer arrested
Police in La Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson 20, at 11 a.m., according to a news release.
He had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately he was dead", police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, 247 Sports reported.
Wade came forward to save his friend and shot Simpson.
Simpson was questioned about this and admitted that he was the one at the scene with the gun and that he was the one who shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch guard who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, including 10 starts, and averaged 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes the World Championship round after winning against Sebastian Vettel after the team order
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Batas qualified over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would play a bigger role in the race.
From the pole, Batas got off to a good start and defended his position in the first two turns, almost preventing Hamilton from scoring any points and thus inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Wettle went to the pits first and let Hamilton drive behind the group in traffic, which was crucial.
Mercedes then pitched a lap and Vettel pulled out behind, but Hamilton went ahead with some wheel-to-wheel action, which allowed the Ferrari driver to reluctantly pass inside after the double move to protect the third corner freely, thus risking him being left out.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He led for the majority of the race as he held his tires to finish the race quickly and push Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
He finally came to the pits on lap 44 but was unable to increase speed for the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a difficult day because Voltaire did all the work perfectly over the weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have one or two", said Hamilton.
It is really bad sign language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feynman Tane at a rally on Saturday after she insisted that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had not leaked a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford alleging sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president responded that Ford did not directly address the testimony he gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead showed people what was going on in the Senate as "selfish and disgusting and false".
"One of the things that has been happening in the Senate over the last few days and the beautiful thing is what it feels like when you see anger, when you see angry and mean and ugly and lying people", he said.
"You see the release and the leak and then they're like, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it".
What is the purpose of the Bible?
Diane Feynman, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I know.
I did not leak".
Okay, wait a minute.
We leaked ... No, we didn't", he added, echoing the sentiments of a senator.
In July Ford sent a letter to Feynman's Ten explaining the charges against Kavanagh, and it was leaked before September - but Feynman denied that the leak came from his office.
"I don't know Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story", Feines told the panel, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as she asked".
But his refusal didn't seem to sit well with the president, who reacted at a Saturday night rally: "What I'm saying, that's really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
Defending the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president accused Democrats of using the charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to take power by any means necessary.
You see all the selfishness, the abomination in them, who they hurt, who they drive to get power and control, they don't even care", the president said, Medialight reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against Bell Fast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars avenged their Elite League defeat to the Bell Fast Giants by winning the return match in Dundee on Saturday 5-3
The Giants took an early two-goal lead with strikers Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney helped their team to tie the Dwyer Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard had equalised for Dundee's goals before two Lucas Lundwald Nielsen goals secured the win.
This is Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of the season, having come to beat Dundee 2-1 in the Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer scored the opening goal with Kendall McFaul's help in the fourth minute at 3:35, doubling the lead for Beaulieu when David Rutherford provided an assist four minutes later.
Sullivan brought his team to the field in 13:10 in a tight opening. Cooney then equalized the gap to 15:16 for Matt McWard.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead into the first half by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The hosts rallied and Bouchard was added to the field once again with a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran helped Nelson lead Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and secured the victory in the final half of their team's fifth period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies after trying to save hundreds of people on board
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now being hailed as a hero for sacrificing his life to help hundreds of passengers safely fly off the ground.
More than 800 people died and nearly people are missing after an earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The situation has caused a stir in Palu city, where many people are still suspected to be trapped under the rubble.
Despite the panic of all his colleagues, 21-year-old Antonion Gunawan Agung, who was still hanging by the earthquake, did not leave the control tower of Sis Al-Jufri Airport, Palu Airport, Mutiara.
He was still in the tower to ensure that Bottic Air Flight 6321 was safely taking off from the runway at that moment.
He jumped out of the tower thinking it was going to collapse.
He died in hospital.
"His decision saved the lives of hundreds", said Johannes Sirit, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Australian ABC News reported.
We brought a helicopter from Balikappan in Kalimantan and made preparations to transfer him to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him earlier today before the helicopter reached the bridge.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this news", he said.
Meanwhile, access to the towns of Dongola, Sigi and Boutang was limited, the country's disaster management agency said.
"Many bodies are still in the rubble, but it is believed that the number is still at risk of increasing as many cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which rose to six meters, destroyed the porch and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing supplies for relief and assistance.
A 35-year-old woman, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances are bringing bodies in.
Access to clean water is scarce.
Mini markets are being looted everywhere".
John Gell Fund, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross rescue workers are rushing to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It has already proved to be a disaster, but it could be worse.'
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am anxiously asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to taxation.
Are you ready?" he said, CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people died in an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea now says one person is missing after Lagoon plane crash
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean off Micronesia has now officially said one person is missing, after previously saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sunken plane.
As of Saturday afternoon, it was not possible to count the male passengers, Air Newini said in a statement.
The airline said that it is trying to locate the individual with the help of local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the age or nationality of the passengers.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Seven people were hospitalized, officials said on Friday.
Six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday and all of them are in stable condition, the airline said.
The cause of the accident and what happened is still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the aircraft landed in the lagoon area just behind the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jans said the plane had come too low.
"It's very good", said Janes.
Jans said he and others managed to run through waist-level water to find an emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were scared and screaming, which resulted in minor head injuries.
The Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the wharf also rushed to the rescue and helped with the evacuation using inflatable boats to push people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
The figures from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG registered aircraft in the last two decades but none of the accidents involves Air New Guinea.
The night's woman was burned alive, analyst tells time
The prosecution, which tried a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014, reserved its argument on Saturday.
Forensic analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of U.S. intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how cell phone records were used to record the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers (who was murdered) on the night of Jessica's death.
Roulet said he had received location data from several cell phones, which showed Telles was with Chambers on the evening of the murder, which contradicts what he said, The Clarion Ledger reported.
Aropi claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, but data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time, and police went to question Sanford.
Sanford came to testify on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors heard Tellis say he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford was lying because my truck was in Nashville that night".
Another irony is that Tells told me that he only knew Chambers about two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records suggest they only met each other a week ago.
After Chambers' death, Tells deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone, according to Roulette.
"He's erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that the trial is expected to go to the jury later that day.

Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Acala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York nurse sued a couple for texting on a "racial" topic
A New York nurse who received a message that mistakenly said "another black guy" from a woman sued the couple for discrimination.
The couple denied accusations that they had been racist and likened the lawsuit to "bribes".
When new childcare dad Giselle Maris arrived at work on her first day in 2016, she was bored by two mothers named Linse Plasco-Flaxman, who discovered she was black.
"No, another black man", Mrs. Plasco-Fluxman sent a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
After realizing his embarrassing mistake, the "shame-stricken" Plasco-Flaxman fired Morris, accusing the nurse, who was African-American, of doing a bad thing and sent him home, and reported that he was expecting a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home on Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for racial intimidation based on the message and even demanding compensation of $350 a day for six months, without a contract, as she was a live-in gig that she was initially hired to work on.
"I want to show it, look, you don't do that kind of thing", he told the Friday Post, "I know it's racial discrimination".
By saying that firing Maris from her job was a reasonable thing to do, the couple are committed to the statement that she is racist, accusing her of not being able to trust her after she was humiliated.
"My wife sent me a text message that I couldn't tell her.
She is not a racist.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post that we are not racists.
"But would you hand your children over to a woman who behaves so badly?
What about your newborn baby?
Tell me what you think".
He also said that his wife has only two months left to give birth and that "she is in a very difficult situation".
"Do you trust and follow such men?
It is not such a good job", said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing in court, the court of public opinion is at the forefront of condemning couples on social media, with the number of those blaming them for their behavior and logic increasing moment by moment.
The publishers of Padding Ton feared that the idea of a talking bear would be difficult to accept, a new letter said.
In her letter, Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was published, said: "It is very difficult to play the role of another, and I have read this book for the first time even before it was printed.
It is truly amazing when you think about the secret behind the incredible success of Padding Tons.
She said that she was inspired by a toy bear and that before writing a children's book, she worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She was confident in her work even when her book was rejected.
Apart from Padding Ton, she says Padding Ton is also "like an honorary member of our household", which she says is a remarkable success.
She also said: "He was one of the most quiet people, the least talkative, and never boastful about his accomplishments".
"But Paddington was a real person to him. It's like what it's like to have a child who's a success in front of you, like: You're not proud of what you didn't do, like that.
I think that's how he saw the success of Padding Tons.
Even though it was his creation and concept, he would give full credit to the padding itself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where all attempts by doctors to save her life were in vain.
"Nad was calling repeatedly to say it was really serious, and I didn't expect her to take the call", said Mrs. Ednan-Lapperhouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I will join you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication given to her to pump her heart slowly went out of place and she abandoned the body.
She had died a short time ago and the body was becoming neutral.
I had to sit there and wait, I knew it was all predestined.
I could not scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by my family members and others.
I really had to hold it together".
Finally Mrs. Ednon-Lapper House, now grieving over the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - forgetting the firefight she was experiencing.
"No one knows", she explained.
"I bowed my head down, and I was weeping the whole way.
It's hard to explain, but it expressed this unspeakable sympathy for Nad while in flight.
He needs my guidance and love.
I know how much he loved her".
Posters of a woman mourning suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys, two women, are posting inspirational messages on Welsh Bridge, along with phone numbers, to let anyone who needs help or comfort call.
When Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old, he began to suffer from depression. He committed suicide when he was about 18.
"I ask that no parent should experience the pain I experience every day", he said.
Ms Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious sense of humor.
"Everyone was amazed at his laughter.
His smile would light up any room".
And he also left his work before his death, and was in the place of darkness.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then only 11, was the brother he found after he took his own life.
"I always worry that something bad will happen", said Mrs. David.
She said, "Even in the midst of grief, there are people to talk to, share your pain with, and you have a friend.
Don't just sit silent - you need to speak now".
Ms. Humphreys, Davis' girlfriend of many years, has lost her 15-year-old life partner, Mark, after the death of his mother.
"He never told me that he was depressed or that he was sad", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the room on Christmas Day - and when the kids opened their Christmas gift boxes, he didn't even look at them".
She said that his death was an unbearable shock to them, but they tried to get over it: "It was a big trauma to their family.
It made us different.
But we accepted it and fought".
If you are experiencing any sadness or depression, please call 116 123 (UK and Ireland) or email jo@samaritans.org. Here you will find a counsellor to talk about your sadness or visit the Samaritans website.
The FBI continues the investigation, so Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy
"I think we get a little bit of what he's asking for - the investigation time, the scope is very limited. We can bring some unity", Mr. Flake said.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican friends want an FBI investigation?
Their hesitation is due to the present time.
With the midterm elections on November 6, which are only five weeks away - as expected, Republicans don't get the results right. They are severely under-represented in their attempt to elect the person they want to the world's highest court.
George W. Bush called to call the senators. He is lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and through him we met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The Senate currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
I still don't understand. Mr. Kavanaugh should have at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, so who let Mike Pence, the Vice President, end the tie and tell the Supreme Court?
The number of people fleeing North Korea 'smalled' under Kim's rule
A South Korean lawmaker has said that the number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago.
South Korea's unification minister Park Byung-seug also supplied figures, stating that 2,706 people fled the country in 2011, compared with 1,127 the previous year.
Park said the reason for this was the tight border between North Korea and China and the double-digit tariffs for human trafficking.
There has been no official statement from Pang Yong.
Most of the North Korean refugees have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reported that about 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the 1953 Korean War.
Most people have fled the country through the Chinese border, which shares a long border with their country rather than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats those who flee as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and in most cases, they are extradited back to North Korea.
North and South Korea are still technically at war, but relations have improved in the past few months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss nuclear disarmament.
This development follows a historic meeting in Singapore in June with Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump, in which the two discussed how to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho condemned the US contribution to development.
"Without the confidence of the United States, we cannot unilaterally disarm our national security", Ri said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and therefore unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and expressed her opinion that he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that when a woman ever behaves like that, they call her 'crazy,'" Pelosi said Thursday, responding to Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanagh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
He denied allegations that the abuse took place when Kavanagh and Christine Blasey Ford were both teenagers.
He openly denounced the Democrats on the committee, arguing that the charges against him were "a vicious and organized assassination of characters" organized by liberals. He expressed outrage that this was why Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed his belief that Kavanaugh's testimony proved his opinion that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it highlighted his bias against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself because of those statements and his statement about Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was disappointed when asked if he would try to impeach if Kavanaugh was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only are they going to be appearing in the Supreme Court, they're not fit to be in court right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said he was concerned about the Affordable Care Act or the verdicts against Roy v. Wade because, according to him, Kavanaugh is a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanagh did not answer questions about whether he would withdraw some of the judgments given in the Supreme Courts.
"This is not the time for a maniac and a biased person to go to court and say, 'That's not great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It was the angry words of a righteous person, even after months and years that anger comes out, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem, 45, told me later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "One female officer helped me so much that she said that she would cry when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "I'm crying because you might think I'm sad.
I am angry with you".
Then she continued.
And I thought it was amazing".
Tears have been seen as a way to vent anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
My first recollection of work is of a time when I was in a male-dominated office, crying with indescribable rage, when an elderly woman grabbed my collar strap and pulled me down the stairs, a little terrified that someone was pulling me down.
"Don't let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They feel your grief and may rejoice in your grief".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential race.
In 1987, when she was caught in an extramarital affair on the boat Heart Monkey Business and turned away from the embarrassment, Mrs. Schroeder was so disappointed that she found no reason to withdraw from the presidential race.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
She had already begun the campaign too late. She had been behind in the fundraiser, vowing to raise $2 million, and had threatened to withdraw from the race if she did not do so.
It was a losing war.
She learned that some of her supporters had given $1,000 to the men and had given her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she made a speech announcing that she would not start a campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotions - thanking the people who supported her, saying it would be very difficult to raise money and reach the goal. She expressed frustration with the system.
"You might think I had a breakdown from nervous weakness", recalled Ms. Schroeder, explaining how the press reacted to her.
"You thought Klenex was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder, what would they write on my grave?
"Is she a mother-in-law?"
How the U.S.-China trade war has done Beijing good
The trade war between the US and China is not going quiet today, and while the war is far away, experts are of the opinion that the rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant development is the imposition of tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods this week, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has also retaliated each time, most recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to join the US, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to shrink much any time soon.
To push back on Washington means to be targeted for demands, but to publicly bow to the US would be very embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing can play its game properly, the pressure of the US trade war will positively support China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Experts believe that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would cripple the economies of both countries, which is more dangerous than previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank that monitors Asia.
Syrian Foreign Minister 'ready' for the return of refugees
The government, which is committed to rebuilding the country after seven years of prolonged war, has asked the refugees to come back voluntarily to help.
Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moolem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation is very stable and secure. I thank the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The Government will continue to work to bring the areas devastated by terrorism back to normal.
Now is the time for people who have left the country for their livelihood and livestock due to terrorism and unilateral economic policies to return to the country of their own free will.
According to the United Nations, an estimated 5.5 million people fled Syria in 2011.
Six million more people live in this country and they need our humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maolem said the Syrian government welcomes those who help rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not accept help from countries that helped his country's insurgency or from countries that provide conditional aid.
The European team that won the Paris-Ryder Cup
Team Europe defeated Team USA by 16.5 to 10.5 in the 2018 Ryder Cup at the Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The Danish-born captain Thomas Jorn's team regained the European crown as they reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the USA team.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled without form for most of the tournament, dipped his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, he lost the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all his rounds, becoming one of only 1 of 4 players to achieve 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Speith of the United States was the lowest ranked player on the European team, losing in the 5th and 4th rounds to Tharb Jorn Olesen of Denmark
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who played probably his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia is the all-time winner of the European Tour with a career score of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry but today I couldn't stop myself.
It has been a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy to win the cup again.
"I'm happy, I'm happy to have contributed to the team's victory", said Garcia, who was emotional after winning the European Cup.
He handed the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Wood in the singles on Sunday, 2-1.
"I'm really proud", said 23-year-old Rahm. "I can't believe I beat Tiger Woods, who I grew up watching".
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It's really strange that Tiger Woods, who has won the most major titles after Jack Nicklaus, has 14 titles.
The American team had a lot to eat this weekend, but only Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnow played their best game of the tournament.
Speaking after his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought well.
This morning we had a bit of a warm-up for the European team.
But we ruined it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 players and am proud to serve as their captain.
I salute you.
We played well".
Red tide updates: Algae concentrations are declining in Pinellas, Manate, and Sarasota
