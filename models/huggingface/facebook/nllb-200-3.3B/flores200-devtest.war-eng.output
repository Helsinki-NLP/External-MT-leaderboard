This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is spreading, but it also provides details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional shapes.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is chestnut-brown on the top with a pale or carotenoid color beneath.
The findings still provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other features of feathers  barbs and barbels  researchers have argued that the rachis was a late evolutionary development against these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature or vision. The researchers suggest that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult's feather rather than a chicken's skin.
The researchers suggest that, although this is the skull of a baby dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult and not the skin of a chicken.

Candidates could send their caregivers to witness each part of the process. At night, the votes of the volunteers were counted under heavy management, following particular procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was constantly in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on trial for the murder of his son.
He was in custody while awaiting trial and facing trial, but any evidence found might have been contaminated because his image had been discredited.
This practice is common elsewhere in the UK but justice has been different in Scotland and the court has seen the publication of the photos as potentially disruptive.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University says that "journalists often walk a dangerous line when posting photos and other material of suspects".
The Crown Office, which handled the cases, informed the press that no further comment would be released at all until the trial.
The document, according to the leak, refers to the border battles, which Palestine wanted to base on the border battles before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed in print included the future state of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel maintained a continuous military presence in the mountains for ten years at the time of signing an agreement while the PA agreed to leave such a presence for only five years.
Pest control field trials should be subject to peer review, since the trials are monitored and their effectiveness is evaluated.
In conjunction with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members present.
This was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a move to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have been held over the failure to hold elections, some as far back as 2011.
Some 60 cases of unmarked iPods were crushed by overload, causing a total of six fires that left four people with minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it is aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "minor".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delayed report "very troubling"
The quake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The emergency management office in the Northern Marianas Region said that no national disasters had been reported to them.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
Four Filipino policemen kidnapped a Hong Kong tourist by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead in the ambush.
Six hostages, including children and elderly persons, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Before long, photographers switched positions to photograph the elderly woman, who had to use a washcloth, and Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor during his off-hours.
His research shows that when the hormone is stimulated it can accelerate the development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had recovered two 'black box' flight recorders from the Wednesday flight.
Luna is still revered by his fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the most fun Queen of Extreme. My favorite manager. Luna died the night before last two months. She was just as different. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna has the same sense of humor as I do...but even more so...I love her and miss her...and she's in a good place".
Out of 1,400 people who polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased 8 percent since 2008.
Observant Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share the same view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch in Australia.
At the conclusion of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should soon become a republic, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints her health was in doubt.
He was unable to take medication needed to help relieve the pain because it was forbidden from the Mulay.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
A few people confirmed the discovery using a variety of hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets that may have been formed by the delivery of water to the earth contain organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how planets, especially Earth, formed, since comets have been striking the Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "political and silly".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology in place of older ground-based radar-based technology that allows the overhead traffic to control the pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional cars will be parked and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will no longer be used below.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the mules would be beaten behind closed doors by unwitting supporters of the group.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to be much longer, due to the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold could be shaped into many different forms, and it could be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be wound on thin wire, which can be twisted and bent. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make a marker using the red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level indicates the number of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that are replaced by their electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Brick both dry powder and then, with clean clay hands, crush it into a ball.
The fluid in your hands reacts with the outer layers, which become a sensory stimulus and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of the funerary system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were still common in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled in equal company.
If you are to call a person thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A space satellite receives a signal and then immediately sends it back down.
The satellite is launched by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of our light and radiation.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
Below this are just the right size of lizards that have eaten just the right amount of prey from lizards to antelopes and one.
Finally, many small rodents (including untamed pet rodents) eat smaller prey such as insects, ants, wasps, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of geographical adaptation, a special task for each species that prevents competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the reptiles, living in large groups called pride.
The pride was composed of one to three male couples of the right age, plus up to thirty women and children.
The women were usually close to one another, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behave like wolf packs or a pack of wolves, lion-like animals (but not the big ones) are prey, and kill their victims.
A fearsome athlete, the tiger can run (even poorly), swim, jump a great distance and can throw five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four species are the only predators.
The tiger's roar is not the same as the lion's full-throated roar, but it is more like a roar of fierce, loud words.
The ocelots are known for their love of small animals, and they have captured monkeys, snakes, ducks, and birds whenever they have been able to do so.
Scientists thought that ocelots tracked and searched for prey (victims) by hammering, hitting where they landed.
They can see clearly even in the dark with night vision, and they still move about secretly. The ocelots capture their prey by moving around and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (such as when it moves to a mountain or river, or when it moves to a new island so that it cannot be moved again) it often finds itself in a different environment from where it was before.
This new environment has a variety of resources and a variety of competitors, so the new population will require a variety of qualities or adaptations to be a strong competitor against what they were originally known for.
The original population was virtually unchanged, requiring the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to decline along with other populations.
In a few decades, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have become so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable destiny and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they also produce the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants obtain their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and our clothes from plants. Plants are the main ingredient of our food. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaurus is the tail that spends its time, its eye without fear, except for the other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, with an additional set of teeth on the roof of the mouth, meaning that nothing can get in its way.
We cannot be sure, but it may have had a sharp tongue, and it may have fed on lobsters, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even cannibals.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex.
While we may be familiar with the sophistication of their food, the Romans had some exotic or unique festive items, including wild boar, paboreal, breasts, and a type of yacht called a dormouse
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals while sitting in chairs, the rich preferred to sit where they were reclining on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primeval temple for each of their gods, which they thought was the abode of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an opening to the temple court and an entrance to the sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Some erect special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, to form part of temples.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot summer climate of the Middle East, home is not important.
The Hebrew family lived outdoors.
Women cooked food in the open air; shops were open only to the street-side trash; houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, but the wood was very valuable.
Norse legends say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on a journey further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map had the Declaration of Independence written on the back.
Although someone may have written on the back of the document, it is not a map of wealth.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776".
While no one can be certain who exactly wrote it, it is known that early in his life, a large cuneiform document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was drawn for the purpose of measurement.
Thus, the notation may simply be added as a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but not just the south.
It was ruled by "Vichy" French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies occupied the southern part of France, the occupation being called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had cleared the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by that substantial group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and likewise describes the extent of society.
City-states are the starting point of nations. A culture of civilization describes the transmission of knowledge across generations, a sustained cultural fervor and equitable distribution.
Many of the lost cultures disappear without leaving any historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government that Congress had composed under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacks any power to enforce taxes, and, lacking an executive or a judiciary, it relies on the state authorities, who are largely uncooperative, to enforce all of its acts.
They still had no authority to control the laws on taxes and interstate tariffs.
The Articles require full consent from all the states before they can be amended and the states simply ignore the central government in the absence of their representatives.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international events and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that comprise Japan, it is often called an "archipelago" geographically speaking
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European explorers recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift from indigenous rice-producing activities and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Many of the buildings around the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in their original form.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration is still going on.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the closing era of analog film.
It is still made today, but its aspect ratio is more important than that of digital camera image sensor formats.
It is actually a 35mm format, apparently a blur, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are able to approximate or approximate this aspect ratio.
The highly abusive and constant-scale rule of thirds is the simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining the scale of a composite image.
This suggests that the most effective location for the main subject is where the lines that divide the image into a third vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years Christianity had united the states of Europe behind the differences of language and customs.
The range of its powers extends from the king to the common people.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and misery and that church funds should be used for that purpose.
The church's center of authority has been in Rome for well over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money raises many questions as to whether this belief is true.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violates some generally accepted international rules devised by some international observers over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire section of the sea, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
With a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its uncontrolled submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the enduring values of indigenous peoples and nations were pacifism and militarism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war in World War I, the nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his first job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different points in time; each Chinese state or ruling family was a different dynasty.
And still in the middle of each dynasty is the unstable age of the provinces. The most famous of these times is the Three Kingdoms period which took place during the 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times, violent conflicts occurred among many nobles vying for the throne.
During the Three Kingdoms, the bloodiest period in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the majestic palace of Xian.
The social and political effects were many, including the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
The Revolution still opened the jobs to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and earnest to succeed.
The same is true of the military, where ranks are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other poor working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He would frequently go to a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on the crest of a hill north of Mecca, the cave is virtually cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not so easy to find even if one knows that it exists. Once inside the cave, the separation is complete.
Nothing but the clear, beautiful skies above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures erected in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "up bow" V-shaped mark and the "down bow mark" appear to be a staple or square without its bottom.
An up means that you start at the top and push the bow, and a down means that you start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and push the bow.
The up-bow produces a more subdued sound, while the down-bow is louder and more powerful.
Do not hesitate to add your own markings, but remember that printed bow marks are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 and Louis-Charles, four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of women in the market.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob that shouted and shouted threats against the King and Queen.
A mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their chariot wide.
On one occasion a member of the troublemakers flagged the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits made from the long exploitation of the Filipinos could be squandered by the chief beneficiaries of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages is the period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is the term that carries the broad range of concepts of function, from the technology-essentials or the necessary technology to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by the logic of the law of sensation and their expression in technology.
Common interpretations of technological determinism follow two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has effects on social behaviors, rather than social conditions.
For example, one might say that the motor car should lead to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide network would not be economically viable for small cars, so the new method of manufacturing was developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
Car ownership has led to a high incidence of road accidents, which has led to the development of new treatments for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the embodiment of the individual, and over time customs and cultures associated with this geography emerged, and these, united in the social sphere, were more in opposition to the established established laws.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the free world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of pride began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status in the twelfth century was enhanced by the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices more valuable than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was during this period that the title of the Iron Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Byzantine culture had a great influence on the dress of the east from the very beginning.
However, because of the slowness of communication routes, the western style is delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of the time as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to stretch their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is practiced for the production of food that is sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, organic, system using collected seeds native to an ecoregion that is supplemented by crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, many farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, as is the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel the neglect of social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ based on age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that mark a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and idioms.
One of the most common ways used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to take a few tragic cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized with adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "vulnerable" or "unruly". Some violent children are imprisoned by people (including their own parents); in some cases this is child neglect due to parental rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical defects.
Violent children may have experienced severe abuse in childhood or trauma after being abandoned or abandoned.
Some are domesticated and raised by animals; others are nomadic hunter-gatherers who live by themselves in the forest.
When raised almost exclusively by nonhuman animals, the aggressive child exhibits behaviors (within the physical limits) that almost entirely mimic that particular caretaker animal, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning can make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding adds another step.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique but a tool that provides support to individuals embarking on a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, that is, the teacher is a scaffold shape but just like the little paperclip human-human in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in a software and are intended to ask, suggest, and explain methods that might tempt the student to act alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons that range from neglect to abuse and even abuse.
No child should grow up in an environment that is uncaring, unkind, and uneducated, but they are.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster-care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, reliable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care must be able to provide all the necessities that are lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet has combined elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The peculiar nature of the internet has led to an increased sophistication of its use and its entertainment strategy.
For example, knowledge and engagement have been suggested as important motivators for the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal peace and lasting relationships are also recognized as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigate the reaction of website visitors.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of tiny expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect when a person is lying by correctly interpreting small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, noted how people who are speech-impaired because of brain damage can still correctly interpret sincerity.
He even suggested that this ability to interpret human behavior may have been inherited by animals such as the hunting dogs.
Twenty-first-century research shows that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, which selection removes from the population of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination reduce the variation between the two groups over each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid needs from plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources to obtain are proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (fungi, snails, eggs) not only are easily digested but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our forefathers solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the jungle.
Sleep paralysis is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleeping time and falling asleep only for a short time (1060 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a quiet alarm clock to make you feel that you are not fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting your bedroom clock, it may be placed in another part of the room, forcing you to work to set it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing one to act to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is the opposite of the amount of tension that a person has in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive life-force there is. Each person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is supplemented by the path of love and the many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, incorporating Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of light) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through the visualization of the various gods energy pathways are cleared, chakras are activated and the awareness of light is created.
Germany was a common adversary in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collapse of systems, processes and cultures led to the collapse of nations.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were at odds with each other and the Cold War began.
This would last for the next 40 years of actual conflict, through proxy armies, in conflicts from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted overnight, when over 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts ending the occupation of Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is the most effective means today of transporting large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The job of traditional navies is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your opponent's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most dramatic recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, perhaps Britain would have been as much a part of Germany as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cut them down for the rapid extraction of milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often tended by young or younger shepherds, similar to the more well-known shepherds.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although the wagons were made of identical wooden planks, they allowed the horses to beat them to achieve higher speeds and to haul larger loads against the rougher road of the old days.
Crossties were introduced earlier to replace track ties in the field, but it was gradually realized that the ties would be better if they had a steel part on top.
This became a common practice, but the battle caused even more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (erect man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, could not walk upright in the traditional way.
Bipedal specializations are seen in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can contribute to environmental causes, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some areas.
But if we do not want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems, and we must eliminate them.
Clearly, the world has been greatly changed by mankind's advances in science and technology, and problems have been compounded by overpopulation and the pervasive human way of life.
After this was agreed to by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were produced, known today as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still seem to resemble the dinosaurs.
They had spiny legs and claws, were hunchbacked, and walked with their feet backwards like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information in the encoded form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are designated as binary digits - or bits, for computer jargon.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, should be so general that a quick diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic chemicals in the home.
Refer to the label for specific instructions for that specific drug.
The term bug has been used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the familiar Sudlots, insects that are well-known parasites of man.
Both Assassin-bears and Sudlot nidicolous, adapted to live in the host's nest or home.
Across the United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a terminal neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make plans for the adoption of their child.
In an adoption, the adoptive parents withdraw their parental rights so that the other couple can become the child's parents.
The primary purpose of science is to learn how to think about the world in a scientific way, and this approach has actually been the basis for much scientific research.
Yet it is not unique, experimentation, and the experiment is a test used to test one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations and still guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views are accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As Greek scholarship declined, the West saw itself detached from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are largely dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than simple responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self sustaining oscillators that persist during a period of free-running cycling, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Community-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the sights, as well as the flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
One example is to visit, take photographs, and learn about the media in Borneo.
Every morning, people in the small town leave by car to go to their place of work and some find that their work destination is the place they left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everything seems to be connected to, and supported by, the transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science has now shown that the greatest economy of this carbon has stripped the biosphere of one of its most robust supports of human evolution over the past two million years.
All share in society and use transportation systems. Almost all complain about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaint about water quality or bridges breaking down.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or has something happened before?
Traffic Geography is the study of the behavior of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic patterns is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Of course, drivers are likely to operate within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow is likely to have some reasonable similarities and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three basic parameters: (1) the flow, (2) the density, and (3) the speed.
These relationships help plan, design, and operate street facilities.
The ability to fly enabled insects to evade predators more quickly and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Insects often have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them a larger area in a smaller area to hide from their predators.
For instance, the only insects that do not fold their wings are the fly and dragonflies and the butterfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
A few people believe that he is right but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This is reasonable, since the Earth is not perceived to be in motion, is it not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is still the widest river on Earth, sometimes as much as six miles [6.8 km] wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale of the Giza pyramids and the technical perfection of their construction were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt was impressed by its earlier monuments, which were once well over a thousand years older.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications.
Italian was still the everyday language of most civil servants, while Latin was the language of religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, for they are all found in the environment in their native form and are relatively easily mined with specialized tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of a combination of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he still theorized that these transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are usually composed of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are still metals such as silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. Everything is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil is a good friend to many people when it comes out.
Sadly, as new writing techniques developed, the pencil was moved to a more limited state and use.
People now type messages on a computer screen, no longer having to approach a screen.
One can only imagine what the keyboard would be like if something newer came along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to compress a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like a chariot being pulled down a hill, the nucleus releases some of that energy by rearranging itself.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that can easily be destroyed with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide at the nearest point and 100 km wide at the farthest point.
It is thinner below the marshes and denser below the mountains.
The crust is thinner, so it is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what will attract people or what will draw them.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/ or desires that are acted upon while they are in the right age or maturity.
These theories look at what makes some people feel like the things they do and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In the overall story, two parallels may emerge as managers begin to blame their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and hiring people.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one may be an unknown individual who feels that he or she must change everything the group does and do it on their own.
After all, the leader is the one most responsible for the success and failure of the group.
This behavior often results in misunderstandings between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with slight differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their fast-moving physical team.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional team members because their team may be assembled according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
Having a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a distinct feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why is it so difficult for an organization to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for training in learning organization concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used in the most productive department in an organization, creativity and innovation can occur.
As a result, an organization's process that is busy overcoming a problem may lead to a newly developed process to meet customer needs.
And in order for an organization to be sustainable, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as the sharing of knowledge and wisdom in the organization.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive inquiry, thus narrowing the field of research and making it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that a wide variety of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Advances in technology are allowing us to see and examine structures and processes of the brain that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information to build simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavioral, cognitive and intelligent adaptation to a machine.
Research into AI includes the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become discrete disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they are in some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take his students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides a solution to virtual field trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a good way to show a trip and experiences to future classes.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the layout of the website is changed, but older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs also help improve student writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience in the classroom changes it.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger started to work on improving her writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be more intelligent about the world around them".[22] The need to provide an interest to the audience inspires students to be intelligent and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to learn more than the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can articulate their positions in the context of the writings of others as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and has numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south of Niagara Falls and farther north is the home of the unparalleled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more define Ontario as what outsiders consider to be true Canadians.
The northern plains are the most sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises the majority: More African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or are part of France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely conquered on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: It is recommended that any female traveler state that they are married, regardless of the actual state of marriage.
It can also be helpful to wear a ring (not just a very expensive one.
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment and unusual advances, arm-in-arms, and so on.
Be firm in your resistance to men, and don't be afraid to stand up (cultural differences or not, it won't be okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber hunters in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic harbor called Anfa.
It was demolished by the Portuguese and rebuilt under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan renamed the city Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and the full spectrum of geegaw, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda, is a tourist city.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is still a safe haven, any visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the most expensive Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short trip.
Along with the relative impotency of this, "Timbukti" was used as a metaphor for the strange, barren landscape.
Today, Timbuktu is a struggling town, though its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, because of threats from desert sands.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates's special Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African intellectuals.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa and lies along the northern border of Mozambique, the northern border being the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a diverse wildlife.
It is a major attraction in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation charge and an entrance fee for the park.
It may also be useful for one to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry to any of the parks in South Africa or to all the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and the place that tourists consider its main focus.
The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a bar chart that is viewed through the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The vast expanse of Hong Kong Island's province stretches from the reclaimed land down the northern coast.
This is the area that the British colonizers took as their own and if you are looking for evidence of colonial past in the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal wetland, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Indian part of the forest is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Yet the forests are not just a spectrum - they include some of the last remaining stands of the great forests that once occupied the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbands cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is under water/land degradation.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 wild boars in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, although crowded, especially the eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang departures between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are usually crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to remote areas, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 277 feet [83 m], are 1,700 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes that are 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 meters below the bridge.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when it is expected to clear Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group living in present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic nomads who are still trained to survive on agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called "The Giant Province of the Indies", came into being as a result of the encounters of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has preserved many of Paraguay's indigenous customs and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the most difficult polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can still be seen here at other times of the year.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) with a fixed value equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are generally accepted.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; consult with the owners in advance to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It was almost impossible to exchange the Falklands' currency outside the islands, so the money had to be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures as high as +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and moisture accumulate to make it colder than the thermometer said.
There are no particular "rain" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are now hungry for people, wildlife is still wild and should not be eaten or tamed.
According to park officials, keep a distance of at least 100 yards [100 yards] from bears or wolves and 25 yards [25 yards] from all other wildlife!
No matter how friendly they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals are vulnerable.
Each year dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the freedom struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting resulted in the assassination of the most important leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are numerous, due to Auckland's connection with two islands.
The North Shore coast (in the North Habour district) lies on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beach is almost pristine with no swimming and plenty of shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, just above the market towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
It is a family beach with many shops located on the beach.
The leading local beer is 'Number One', not a sophisticated beer, but delicious and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines are drinkable, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more palatable.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available only if you are nervous.
The idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians, as is the shorter black, the cappuccino with cream (not froth), and the tea served without milk.
The hot chocolate is based on Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but very tasty.
Many trips to the dunes are made throughout the year, and the damage from any cause to the dunes is exceptional.
Still, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to rescue reminders.
The box jellyfish shows up near the shores and near the river esters from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim farther away.
The Saltwater Crocodile is not an active seabird, its primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to board at the time of arrival at his destination.
Travel agents usually have deals on specific hotels, though you may find it possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even a combined flight and hotel package.
They may still hold the reservation for you if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendants decide to camp on the site, and most attendants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you need to get in early to get a campsite close to the music.
Note that even after the main parts of the music have been completed, some parts of the festival may continue to be played until midnight.
Some festivals have a special camping area for families with young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice will cause terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include the city time. Cruise passengers are exempt from required visas (see terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to save visitors time and money. They often have no windows and clocks, and the grills are difficult to clean.
They often have special foods, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them in their place.
Similarly, alcohol can impair judgment, and all who are good at drinking know the importance of keeping in their senses.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain roads must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, the right amount of snow to keep you warm may fall in a matter of hours.
Visibility can still be limited by falling or splashing snow or by condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs almost uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey by land to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to live close to cars and standard equipment will allow good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "footing") consists of hiking, which can be done over a period of a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, hosting the men's in 1964.
If you booked your flights for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not been in place until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a plank and ironing board that can be used for ironing, even when no one is present in the room.
If you do not have a faucet, or if you do not want to wear a plain stocking, you might try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (which can cause burns, or in extreme cases, heat).
There are various methods of purifying water, some more effective against particular threats.
In some places, pouring water for one minute is appropriate, in others for several minutes.
The effects of filters vary, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals unfamiliar to their home regions.
Pests can cause food to spoil, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or cause infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can inflict disaster or kill a person by force, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without taxes and excise duties at a few particular locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The gap between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult conditions for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, let your wisdom be with you: The steep grades, the winding roads, and the straight curves are all there.
The posted speed limits are noted to be the most effective against the preceding and following sections -- usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) -- and strict adherence to these is the most important against anything.
Surprisingly, though, mobile phone service is stronger here than on many other scenic routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are somewhat bland, and in Bavaria, they are somewhat richer and more varied, as in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples baked in the pastry all year round, and cherries and plums on display during the summer.
Many German baked goods also offer almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try the so-called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a vegetable-based soup and seasoning, with any meat or vegetable.
Curry can be "dry" or "dry" depending on the amount of liquid.
In those regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is the common ingredient in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, the cabbage husk is the common ingredient.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term covering the many kinds of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without additional qualifiers, the term likely means that the dish originated in the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now widely used throughout the archipelago, Javanese foolishly features simple dishes, the staples familiar to Javanese are peanuts, rice, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
The legs are the support for the rider's feet that are arranged either under or on the side of the saddle.
They provide extra stability for the rider but can cause safety concerns because of the potential for the feet of riders to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but one foot is stuck in the stirrup, they may be held up if the horse is running away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions should be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a low, flat, relatively short heel.
Next, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow a leather seat to fall back onto the saddle when a fallen rider is bounced back.
Cochamó Valley - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its steep granite walls and cliffs.
Summits include breathtaking views from above. Summits from all over the world continue to forge new routes amid the endless potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a leading tourist activity with a large number of people leaning in, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan an entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old -- cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Bottom skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
Related but not usually confused with alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter is done on sloped terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as a parallel to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you may be able to cover a longer distance than by walking - but you rarely get the speed of cross country skiing with an unweighted backpack on good roads.
Europe is a relatively small continent that is home to many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between countries means that you have to go through many visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen zone, however, seems to be a country in its own right.
As long as you live in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to pass passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.

A rip current is the backflow of water from the waves that wash ashore, carried by a boat or similar vessel.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is pure at some depth, and the fast current may be completely filled there.
Many deaths occur as a result of fatigue in trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the water, swimming back is no more difficult than it should be.

This meant that you could visit the historic city for several full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go to the coast using boat excursions you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by air can be frightening for some people of all ages and backgrounds, especially those who have never traveled before or who have experienced a frightening experience.
