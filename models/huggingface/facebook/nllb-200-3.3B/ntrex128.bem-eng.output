The concern of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) for looked like a fool
There is some concern amongst the Welsh Government on the idea that the title of their office should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The decision came as a result of a proposed change of name to the Welsh Parliament.
Government officials in all political parties are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour politician said his party was worried that it sounded like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means stupid.
One member of the Plaid group said that the whole group was "disgusted" and had even proposed other alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative party member said his party "wanted to know more about the name change, but said it was a short form of a direct translation from MWP to the word Bupuba.
In this case the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the English u is pronounced in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which drafted the law to make this change of name, stated: "The final authority for any interpretation by the Members of the Constitutional Court shall be vested in the Members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name of the court.
In June, the Labour Party held a public poll in which it was found that a majority of the people wanted the council to be called the Welsh Parliament.
Due to the position of the AMs, the party chose the name Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the preference of the MWP was strongly supported in the public opinion poll.
AM is currently seeking alternate names, but the difficulty of reaching a consensus could be a headache for the prosecutor Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legal opinion on the name change in a few weeks.
The amended law will include a number of changes to the way the court operates, including the rules for the removal of the AM and the structure of the committee's work.
The AM will have a final vote on the question of what to call the debate on the bill.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The decision was part of a broader effort to resolve the long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece over a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name is a reference to its territorial ambitions and has long opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum on the name change and said that he would not support it.
However, supporters of the decision, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a cost to the EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Angels are silent as the Harlem Riots rage
"According to the legends, the old people I spoke with say that there was a village and a congregation for each bird", said Adams.
"Today, none of that exists".
The sound of the waves, he said, was loud.
"People are now more prone to unusual behavior", he said.
"We are no longer a place where people go to rest every hour".
But for the churches, he worries that the revenue from the sale of the goods will not be as much as the leadership hopes, "which will soon be back to where it started".
He added that congregations could be replaced by shelters where the unwanted attitudes of the people would not contribute to the peaceful environment.
"Most of the people who will be buying rooms in these buildings will be white", they said, "which will bring the closing date of the congregations sooner because it may not be possible that all the people who will be entering these rooms will become members of these congregations".
All of the parishes were converted to the Western Church before Harlem became a separate community - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The first white Methodists left the area in the 1930' s.
The congregation that met nearby was moved into the hall.
St. Martin's was taken over by a religious group led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a protest against the business on 125th Street, Harlem's main thoroughfare, that refused to use or even welcome the passersby.
A fire in 1939 left the building in ruins, but when Father Johnson's students tried to rebuild it, they produced a carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillons "the poor man's carillons".
The carillons were called by the carillonneur of the month of April: "the carillons of tradition" and "the irreplaceable instrument of the ages".
The bell, named Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, was also said to be the first bell rung by the world's greatest organist, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the main bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that the parish of St. Martin had not yet found a successor.
What has happened at St. Martin during the past few months is a strong message from the architects and builders, some brought in by the local authority, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish administration - vestry - of the congregation - wrote to the diocese in the month of April with concern that the diocese "would like to extend the fees" to the vestry, even though the latter would not be interested in hiring the architects and builders it had commissioned.
Some members of the congregation complained about the unfairness of the diocese's conduct.
A shark injures a 13-year-old lobster fisherman in California
The shark attacked and scratched a 13-year-old boy who was fishing for lobsters in California on the opening night of the lobster fishery, the adults said.
The accident occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was swimming with a group of friends about one o'clock Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and the group went to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel at first thought that the joy was due to the lobster catch, but then he heard a boy shout, "I'm sick!"
I'm tired of it!'
The shoulder bone was completely removed", Hammel said, adding that he had seen this when he had been working on the boy.
"I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: 'You're in trouble!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed on the emergency list.
The species of shark that attacked him was not well known.
The chief of the rescue team, Capt. Larry Giles, told the nation that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it did not appear to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the boy had severe lesions on his upper back.
Local authorities closed the access road to Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate the incident and to set up a checkpoint.
Giles says that there are as many as 135 shark species in the area, most of which are harmless.
Sainsbury's enters the UK bodybuilding market
Sainsbury's was a member of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and the skin-care section of the company.
As part of the UK's £2.8bn skin care market, which is shrinking as clothing and home care recover, skin care products will be sold in 11 stores nationwide and will be introduced in nine more this year.
The investment in cosmetics has led to many stores filling shelves with televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's claims to have expanded the range of body wash oils to 3,000 varieties, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw on the original volume.
Other established stores such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also occupy the same number of rooms as those found in Boots.
The supermarket is also reorganizing its Boutique department store to make more products for non-vegetarians who are eager to buy more.
In addition, the Fragrance fragrance store will also be opening in Sainsbury's store, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second, which opened earlier this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the daily shopping for small quantities of food at nearby supermarkets mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, the general manager of Sainsbury's, said that the stores selling their products are beginning to look like department stores as the supermarket tries to compete with Aldi and Lidl who are charging higher prices for services and non - edible goods.
Sainsbury's has already started to distribute the Argos brand in a number of stores and has been producing Habitat brands since it bought both brands two years ago, which it says has helped boost sales and create a new brand.
The store's latest test will remove fragments of oil and wood that have been buried.
Sainsbury's tried to work with Boots in the early 2000' s, but the problem arose after a dispute over the price of the store's wooden boots.
The new partnership comes after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
Lloyds could play a key role in this, he said, by adding new brands of skin care products to the four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
"We have changed the look and feel of the beauty parks to enhance the appeal of the area to our customers", says Paul Mills-Hicks, sales manager at Sainsbury's.
We have also set aside funds for training regular attendance and visits.
Our products are designed in a way that meets all the needs of the market and the beautiful and ubiquitous environment means that we are now on the cusp of becoming a market that invites everyone in contrast to the old ways of buying things".
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby leaves £11 million business
Dragons Den singer Peter Jones is 'outraged' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby walked out of her £11 million and luxury business to focus on her new business partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time for Truly's furniture and appliances.
The pair's business was compared to Goop's Gwyneth Paltrow's.
The 37-year-old presenter of the program This Morning took to Instagram to announce her departure.
The departure of Holly Willoughby from Dragons' Den has angered Peter Jones because Holly has left the luxury goods business that was making her big money in a short time - to focus on new business partnerships with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Our source said Jones was "outraged" when the TV personality admitted in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday at his headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business - worth £1.5 million - meant he no longer had time to invest in his Truly furniture and appliances business.
The deal was compared to Goop's property owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to grow to twice Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain and headed to a shopping centre for a holiday.
"Truly's business interests are at the top of Holly's list", said our correspondent.
It was to be his successful business that would carry him forward for many years to come.
His success in getting out has amazed all who have been involved.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday, the closest to the opening of the market.
There is a full- stocked warehouse at Marlow HQ that is being sold".
Critics said the departure of the co-host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable networks, would affect the operations of the store, which sells a range of products including clothes and furniture as well as clothing and home furnishings, as well as delaying the store's opening.
It can also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Three-children's father Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been in a relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined in March.
The two men's names, along with Jones's, account for 40 percent of Baldwin's TV advertising.
Willoughby became the commercial representative for M&S and replaced Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
"We cannot discuss the details of this business relationship", said a source close to Jones last night.
We fell in love after we met
He joked about the potential for a scandal in the news by mentioning some words that some would consider "inappropriate for the president" and strongly supported the North Korean leader.
What prompted President Trump to take such a strong stance?
Trump called his euphemism "a propaganda ploy".
"I have not lost anything".
He knew Kim was eager to meet again after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the debate over nuclear weapons has stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore talks, North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North has not seen a "slow response" from the U.S. to the rapid end of the nuclear arms race in North Korea.
However, he noted that the U.S. was imposing sanctions in order to put pressure on the government.
Trump, in his speech, was optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of lives could have been lost.
Now we have that wonderful relationship".
He said that his efforts to establish relations with Kim would bring good results - ending the testing of rocket artillery, helping rescue hostages and returning the bodies of soldiers to their homeland.
He was defending his own unique approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but when you have 10,000 people outside who need to get into this crowded area, you don't have 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd of protesters.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, nonpartisan organizations were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been left homeless, the country has not declared a national emergency, which would require the withdrawal of international aid.
"Many times, unfortunately, they have been very open about not needing any help, so it's been a relief", Ms. Sumbung said.
At the time Save the Children was planning a trip to Palu, it was not certain that foreign workers would be able to work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for a disaster relief organization, said that Indonesian authorities were still evaluating the extent of the disaster in Palu and whether agencies from outside the country could be allowed to join the relief effort.
In view of the seismic activity that Indonesia experiences on a regular basis, the country is so vulnerable that it is not equipped to survive the ravages of nature.
Although surf locations have been developed in the Aceh area, other coastal areas are not.
The lack of a tsunami warning system in the area, even though it existed, was a major factor in the deaths.
Travel between the many islands of Indonesia is often a challenge.
Natural disasters also strengthened the way of life.
The Lombok earthquake hospital is on the way to Palu, but it may take three days to reach the new epicenter.
President Joko Widodo has invested heavily in repairing Indonesia's damaged infrastructure and roads as a means of attracting voters, and has spent heavily on roads and railways.
But now the money is being withdrawn from Joko's administration as he now approaches re-election this year.
Joko has another problem with the religious crisis in Indonesia, where many Muslims are involved in the so-called "religious" system.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands left homeless as Christian and Islamic factions fought in the streets, using swords, arrows, spears, and other heavy weapons.
Note: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is playing against Chelsea with a similar kick
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League defeat by Chelsea when he scored a hat-trick in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri with 30 yards to go in Chelsea's 1-0 win.
He returned the ball to the left before it was nearly to the top of the net.
This is a long way down, but it turns right to the right of the main altar.
It was difficult to cross the top of Kefa Arrizabalaga and to enter the island.
"He was always keen to get in there, to be on the pitch and players like Shaq always try to play forward, so I was always trying to make time as long as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming to meet you but I didn't pay attention to you and I just accepted".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian Eden Hazard.
The Blue's goalkeeper passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the match, before he went through the centre of the pitch and rushed to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic has come to the end of the pitch and is heading for the middle of the pitch.
Napanuma came to the end of the game, taking Hazard into the penalty box.
Hazard rushed to leave the full-back and made a splash on the left-back flank, passing Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will also face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League play-offs at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Deaths from Indonesian floods rise to 832
The death toll from the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia now stands at 832, the disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Hundreds of people were reportedly buried in the rubble of collapsed buildings as a result of the 7.5 - magnitude quake that struck Friday and triggered waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters.
The city of Palu, with a population of some 380,000, was covered with debris from the collapsing buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of murdering a woman who had been stabbed to death.
An investigation is under way after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with the death.
The police have asked people in the area who witnessed the incident to give evidence.
'The investigation is still ongoing but I would like to ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything that is suspected to be the case to contact us.
I would like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have their cameras recorded, to contact us as they may have information that may help our investigation.'
The spokesman for the police confirmed that the body of the woman was found in the Birkenhead area and that her body was found in the building.
In the afternoon, friends who knew the woman went to the scene of the accident to ask questions about the body and its whereabouts that morning.
The investigation is still ongoing, as the police said they planned to inform the woman's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews wanted to enter his room but was stopped by a policeman because no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The experience is fascinating.
Residents in the area were now being told that it might be a few hours before they would be allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer was overheard telling someone that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman in the crowd is seen crying.
He repeatedly used the word 'terrible.'
At 2pm two police officers are still inside the cordon and another vehicle is outside.
Some police officers stood in the cordon and searched the houses that had collapsed.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 following 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell's House of Commons has become a modern-day monument to 'the revival of the past'
Its banning would be a poetic retribution for his Taliban-like destruction of many aspects of England's culture and religion by his Puritan people.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's statement as "a nonsense" and "a rewrite of history".
John Goldsmith, a councillor in the Cromwell Society, said: "It is beyond doubt in the current debate on the removal of statuary that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster may be one of the objects of the ban.
The preparations for the invasion of the English mainland were neither initiated nor supported by Cromwell.
However, Cromwell may have been influenced by the actions of his great - grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
The most complete account of Cromwell's description of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is the 19th-century translation and historical record of a man who seems to have been a celebrated poet.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, especially in the late 19th century, more as a protector of the House of Commons against outside interference, in his view of the threat to the sovereignty of the individual.
If this event is perfect in its representation, it could be the subject of a continuing discussion in the world's mythology.
The fact is that the revolutions of the mid-seventeenth century were the cause of the next revolution in our country, and Cromwell is a prominent representative of one of the sides of this divide.
His heroic service as Protector of the King is also worthy of praise and respect".
A Chinese Farmer Is Bitten to Death by a Wild Boar
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a unique farmer's market in northern China, according to local radio reports.
The man, known by his middle name "Yuan", was found dead with a ruptured heart, bleeding near a pig farm in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject his pigs on the morning of April 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell his 15 pigs at auction.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, only to find the closest door unlocked.
He said that the large pig was lying in the corner and that it was covered with blood.
An autopsy revealed that the same 550 - pound pig had bitten and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and fractured, said his cousin named "Wu", according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
The funeral director told the Evening News radio program that the pig was chosen to prevent it from attacking anyone, while the police were investigating the matter.
The Yuan family and the village elders discussed the matter of loyalty in their deaths.
Although rare, cases of leopard attacks have occurred in recent times.
In 2016, a husband and wife were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband with severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound pig knocked a Welsh farmer off his tractor until his wife pulled the pig out and rescued him.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually safe, but that even a blood bite can be "dangerous".
"The pig is often very playful.
They have no youthful intelligence, no exploration.... and no fighting.
But you should give it the honor it deserves".
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rain to the western United States
According to meteorological observations, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves toward the northern tip of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the days that follow.
Hurricane Rosa had sustained winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, when it made landfall at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, while moving over 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Tropical Storm Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At this time, clouds begin to rise over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward near the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a hurricane, it will begin to push a cool, northward breeze across the western U.S.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches [4.5 cm] of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Afterward, moist air in combination with clouds will bring heavy rains to the nearby West Coast for the next few days.
In this region, rainfall between 1 and 4 inches will cause landslides, rockfalls, and possibly landslides in the desert.
The cold weather in the area will bring rainfall of up to two and three inches, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of up to 2.5 inches [4 cm] is expected in much of the northern part of the state, especially in the greater Arizona region.
Flooding may occur in conjunction with weather changes due to the spread of heavy rain.
It would be very dangerous to go into the desert on foot because of the threat of this flood.
Heavy rains can turn rivers and streams into rivers and winds can create storms and mudslides.
The approaching clouds brought rain to parts of the peninsula of Southern California.
A total rainfall of up to half an inch can occur, which can lead to pollution and road congestion.
This may be the first of their many blessings.
The distribution of rainfall will begin to move toward Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with less rainfall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Quarter on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
The summer months are hot in the U.S. when the Arctic is hot, but the tropics are cool.
Sometimes this results in a change of only a small amount of distance.
There is a contrast to the U.S. central time on Sunday.
There is a difference of up to 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the heat of the summer begins to build up and intensify again.
The central and eastern U.S. are expected to begin the summer heat wave with temperatures of up to 80 degrees from the Southwest to the East.
New York City can reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80° C.] on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit (10° C.) above average.
Long - term weather forecasts indicate that the eastern U.S. will experience a record high temperature during the first half of the summer.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people have seen the testimony of six national media outlets, in the cases of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman named Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of attempted rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with the media scrambling their programs to air this Friday's news flash: the continuing preparations by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to represent the FBI could take up another week to investigate the matter.
Mrs. Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh was arrested for drunk driving and for trying to strip him during a school funeral.
Kavanaugh, in his most honest testimony, also said that he was 100 percent sure that it had not happened.
According to the latest estimates, more than 20.4 million people watched the trial on Friday, according to figures provided by Nilesen.
The company has been able to track the number of viewers who watched the events on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers received were not immediately available from other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And sometimes the Nielsen company has trouble counting the people who walk into their offices.
To put it simply, this number could be compared to the number of people who watch football in a stadium or attend an Academy Awards convention.
The Fox News Channel, whose ratings are strongly in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination, fell by a margin of 5.69 million viewers during the entire period of the investigation, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The following is a list of the names of the people who were executed for the crime.
Flake was particularly impressed by the talk given on Friday.
After the Republican presidential candidate announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS on Friday morning being cheered by an angry crowd as he climbed a fence to appear before the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his face down in embarrassment as he listened to the news broadcast on CNN.
"I stand here before you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the world?
She was told, "You are stronger than most women are".
Flake said that his office had already discussed the matter before the hearing, and that he had more to say to the board after the hearing.
Radio and television broadcasts covered the events until the next few hours, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate's general election.
But Flake said he was doing so in the hope that the FBI would look into the election this week, something that a small number of Democrats oppose.
Flake was only partially convinced by his conversation with his colleague, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and the other senators, Flake made a deal.
Flake's veto is powerful because it means that Republicans cannot win votes for Kavanaugh without a referendum.
President Trump has suspended the FBI's investigation into all of Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political meddling' in the Brexit debate
Prime Minister Theresa May accused her supporters of "politically meddling" with Britain's political and economic interests, according to the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another close discussion of the first page of the report, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked May's report as a "Chequers Brexit" plot, and said the idea that Britain and the EU should levy a single tax was "totally absurd".
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU student Kate
Police arrested a suspect in the rape and murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in a tent on a second degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The police officer showed video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and then claimed that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the victim and said Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses, the WAFB official told CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he admitted that he had beaten Sims severely.
His bail was set at $350,000, the Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released preliminary information Friday, saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and local residents for their assistance in the arrest of the suspect.
LSU team president Joe Alleva praised the law enforcement department for its "work and commitment to justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
This boy weighed 5.6 tons and saved 2.6 million pounds in the intervening period.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply saddened" and "deeply saddened" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you always worry about", says Wade.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
The eruption of Popocatepetl reached the southern part of the city.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it detected that the eruption had increased its gas and ash levels by 183 times in 24 hours.
This section tracks the frequency of earthquakes and earthquakes.
Some of the images were of cars with dust on the windows in parts of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have reported an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September, 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" first appeared in 1994.
Police clash with Catalan protesters shortly before the march to commemorate the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with police, and several were injured in a violent clash at the start of the referendum for independence in Catalonia.
A mob of protesters in front of the police station was beating them with sticks and paint, creating clouds of dust in streets where tourists are supposed to be.
The fighting sometimes took place during the day and the police used their clubs to break up the fighting.
In the hours that followed, the pro - independence movement shouted "No forgetting, no forgiving" and the Unionists shouted "Forward to Spain".
Fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries sustained in the clashes, said a local radio station.
The scary scene is the scene of the independence movement a year after the referendum of 1 July, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was welcomed by the Catalan revolutionaries.
Most electors voted for independence, although a minority of the various sects refused to vote.
According to Catalan authorities, up to 1,000 people were injured this year after police tried to prevent further clashes in the area where there were large protests.
Freedom groups camped outside on Friday night to protest in support of the national police.
The protests continued but were forced to change course.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said that he had no hope that the region of Catalonia would ever again become independent.
"We have had a very peaceful time in our lives this past year.
I saw my parents cry tears of joy at the opportunity to choose and now we are being forced to do so", she said.
Despite the narrow victory in the December elections, Catalan independence activists have been fighting for power this year with some of their leaders still in exile and others still in prison awaiting punishment for their role in the preparations for the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old auto mechanic who recorded the police protests on her cell phone, said that the riots were supported by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting worse", they said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who were in prison without trial last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The determination to vote for Europe is the best way to avoid a return to the clichés of violence and oppression that characterized the Spanish political system", they said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car crashed into a house several times in Londonderry.
The accident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was to the door and the house itself.
It seems that the arrow has been stuck in the side of the car for some time.
A little boy named Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was the winning goal
The Livingston club, which was promoted, had just beaten Rangers manager Steven Gerrard in two defeats in 18 games against Ibrox.
Dolly Menga made a difference when Gary Holt's character joined Hibernia in the second episode.
Gerrard's side remained unbeaten in the Premiership as they faced top-tier Hearts, who were level eight, on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston's team, meanwhile, continues their winning streak in the division with six games under head coach undefeated Holt who replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's team squandered its chances of victory by hosting stronger teams
Holt's team had to be in the lead despite the lack of goals, and their pace could have caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson crossed the line but was out of bounds when he took the ball, and Alan Lithgow added his strength after sliding and hitting Craig Halkett's head which he hit to level the ball.
The stadium owners were confident that the Rangers would play ahead of them, hoping to beat the visitors at the right time.
It was in this way that the problem was solved.
The Rangers were able to score a goal and Livingston worked on the opening goal, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked on the defensive line, which was a goal from the middle of the goal box.
This time, Rangers took the ball but found the backs stronger and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was well prepared,
This play was followed by a second episode, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save the winner.
Scott Pittman was challenged by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow came up with the ball from another goal made by Livingston.
The ball went on to the Livingston area but was recovered, and two shots - later Halkett's attack on the catcher Glenn Middleton, and a catch - were called.
'Surprise' for the Livingston group - a review from
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The match was a surprise and a surprise win for the Livingston team.
For everyone else, they were well prepared, even more than expected in this exalted position.
Their style of play has not changed since their return to the top, but the credit goes to Holt in the form in which he has brought the team forward since his arrival.
He has many talented soccer players.
Captain Halkett worked hard, preparing the shield for the match, and Menga had Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the ropes for the rest of the match.
However, the Rangers have been very reluctant.
Although they sometimes succeeded under Gerrard's leadership, they were not able to reach those goals.
Their unprecedented play was not enough - they only managed to fill their place once - and they had to take care of the Rangers, now in the middle of a table of tons.
Erdogan is greeted with a welcome in Cologne
There was a smile on his face on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German presidents met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of a difficult visit by German President Erdogan - focused on improving relations between NATO members.
They are leaving for a number of reasons including human rights, democracy and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large mosque.
This is the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police said that for security reasons they were preventing a crowd of up to 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque but many supporters of the president stood at a distance to see their leader.
Many anti-Erdogan people - some of them Kurdish - also spoke out, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's refusal to accept him into their country.
This public protest created a distinct atmosphere of hospitality which the German Turks praised and others treated as tyrannical.
Deptford Road accident: A motorcyclist dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics tried to resuscitate him, but the man died instantly.
The accident occurred just a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, a block from the scene of Saturday's accident.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said that authorities were looking into the man's identity to contact his family.
Road closures and diversions are taking place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were wounded in a riot
Prison guards were injured in the riot at the main male prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
A special squad of "Tornado" soldiers was called in to deal with the riot, which left eight inmates in one part of the prison.
The soldiers were wounded by small cuts right there in the prison.
A spokesman for the Prison Guards said: "Special forces have been sent to monitor the situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six soldiers were taken away with their wounds.
We do not tolerate riots in our prisons, and those who are found guilty of violating this law will be handed over to the police and may face additional years in prison.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In April it was reported that the prison's director was being treated in hospital after a prisoner had been treated.
And in the summer of this year, the military cleanup crew was called to a disastrous cleanup where the crew were beaten with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake, and the Floodwaters (Where Hurricanes Can Affect the City)
It is unlikely that a tropical storm will reach Arizona, but it is possible that it will next week as the last remnants of Tropical Storm Rosa move through the Southwest Desert, where it carries a storm surge.
The National Weather Service issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southeastern Nevada, central California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa was expected to pass over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday with snow.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that 10 tropical storms with winds of up to 200 miles [200 km] had made landfall in Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ line".
The National Hurricane Center's latest forecasts are 2 inches and 4 inches of rain, with some areas up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the area between the Rockies and the Great Basin are expected to receive between 1 and 2 inches of rain, with some areas receiving up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, Rosa's rains can be a blessing because the area is prone to drought.
Although the drought is a serious concern, some of these rains will be a blessing in some areas because the Midwest and Southwest are now in a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the second- worst drought on record", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path is heading toward the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Tropical Storm Rosa, which is still a hurricane early Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is moving 385 miles per hour southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The cold Pacific Ocean is the source of the rain that causes the sea to recede.
Thus, heavy rain is expected in Mexico with the force of tropical rains during the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
The rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be very heavy, which can cause a lot of stress.
"A total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to eastern Sonora, up to 10 inches at times", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move northwestward through Mexico as a tropical storm before making landfall on the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, passing through Arizona and entering southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
These floods are expected to bring devastating rain and drought to the desert, and landslides to the plains.
Midsomer Norton incident: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Two teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with assault wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to a hospital where he is now being treated.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the evening in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The police have asked anyone with a cell phone to come and see us.
Trump says Kavanaugh is a "scam, a scandal, and a disgrace" to the Democratic Party
"Voting for Kavanaugh is a vote against the violence and the corrupt policies of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been harassed, bullied, and insulted by the Democratic Party throughout his election campaign.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcing him to deny the allegation that Christine Blasey Ford tried to rape her as a child.
Ford also testified at the trial about his own speech.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the strength, intelligence, and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for the smartest man of our time, a judge who is known for doing the best for his citizens", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred to the election of Kavanaugh when discussing the Republican landslide in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks remain until the great harvest of our time.
I am not standing by choice, but I am standing by reason", he said.
"That is why I am in many places to support those who represent the authorities".
Trump said that Democrats were on a "serious, balancing and balancing" mission.
The first round of the Senate elections for Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by the earthquake, tsunami and tsunami in Indonesia, and the death toll was rising.
At least 384 people were killed, some were swept away by the waves that swept ashore, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said in a statement.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the sands of the coastal city of Palu on Friday as six-meter (18-foot) waves came crashing ashore in the afternoon, washing away many people and destroying everything found along the way.
These waves followed an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the sound of the waves came yesterday, people were doing their jobs in the sea and they did not immediately run away and were attacked", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster management agency BNPB told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami waves did not just come, they carried away cars, trees, houses, and hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the waves were traveling at sea at speeds of up to 800 kph (497 mph) before they hit the mainland.
Some climbed trees to escape the waves and were saved, they said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerial photographs taken by the disaster area showed that many buildings and shops had been burned, the walls had collapsed and the mosque had been flooded.
Minor earthquakes continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The seismic activity was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia said in a statement that the force of the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
And the construction of the city, which was located on the other side of the island, was said to have caused the waves to rise.
Nugroho described the destruction as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, restaurants and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found lying on the rocks and were thrown down, and it is estimated that 540 more people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of people who were evacuated and the damage could have been caused by the sea at a distance of 300 km (190 miles) northwest of Palu, in an area called Donggala, close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The conversation was chaotic and did not include any specific information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live in the area", said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the disaster area.
"This is a bad, bad, and it can get worse", they said.
The council was overwhelmed on Saturday by the tsunami warning for the Palu area, although officials said the tsunami had come on time and the community had been warned.
A video posted on social media showed a man shouting from a small building to warn people on the streets of the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water washes ashore, washing away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not confirm the video at the time.
The earthquake and waves caused power outages and disrupted communications around Palu, making it impossible for local authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Military airlift of supplies and relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities has begun, officials said, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport, which is closed for charity, will remain vacant until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the Palu refugee camp on Sunday.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian tsunami.
It is very serious.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have made it safely to the city of Palu, where staff live in tarpaulin huts built in the courtyard of their office, the journey has been marred by a series of unusual accidents, Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", they said.
It is very bad.
Although relief groups seemed to be getting ready for disaster relief, some complained that highly qualified relief workers from abroad were being prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian law, the movement of money, goods, and labor from outside the country can only begin when the area is declared a national disaster zone.
This is not unusual.
"This is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, 'OK, this is a global crisis,' we can get foreign aid but that doesn't seem to be the case".
As the second wave hit Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the victims still hold out hope that their loved ones will be like miracles that will restore hope after this terrible tragedy.
On Saturday, a little boy is being washed in a toilet.
On Sunday, rescuers came to the scene and removed the remains of a woman who had been buried under two rocks with her sister's body nearby.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, recovered two of the injured at the Asian Games, which ended last month in Indonesia.
Some of those arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students
"As a paragliding instructor, I have a heavy burden on my heart", he said.
Gendon explained how upon hearing of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse and the spread of the news among the players, they started sending WhatsApp messages to their rivals in Palu, who were participating in the river festival.
Sadly, their message was replaced with a yellow flag, not a blue one.
"I think this means that the news has not arrived", he said.
A thief withdraws $26,750 at an ATM in Newport on the Levee
The robbers on Friday stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was depositing money into an ATM at Newport on Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was withdrawing money from the ATM in the gym and preparing to transport the metal, according to Det. Dennis McCarthy in the report.
When he was dismissed, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the wallet that was being distributed.
Witnesses said they saw suspects begin to leave the area, according to the police, but the police were unable to determine the exact number of people involved in the case.
Anyone with information about the identity of these individuals may contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The singer changes his name to Ye
The musician Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
In his Twitter post on Saturday, he wrote: "The man who was once known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used that name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The name change came in the wake of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to open his new album called Yandhi.
She replaced Ariana Grande for the show who left due to "some issues" with the show's producers.
Despite the shortening of his name as he used it in his current work, West later said that the term had religious connotations for him.
"I believe that ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said during a discussion of his new album earlier this year with producer Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, die.
It is from Kanye, which means one thing, to Him - which only reveals our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This is a very personal statement".
He is one of the most famous singers in the world.
Sean Combs is commonly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his love for the name Love and Brother Love.
Another of West's co-workers, JAY-Z, also occasionally takes the hyphen from his name and writes his name in lower case.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's new president, Andre Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to end the use of military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the student massacre.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never allow the military to oppress Mexican citizens.
The military's crackdown on peaceful protesters at the plaza on October 2, 1968, killed some 300 people as student groups began to form in America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexico's youth by paying for students and opening more universities.
He said that lack of employment and lack of educational opportunities are the main reasons why young people are joining gangs.
The U.S. should increase its A.I. funding.
As China expands its technology efforts, the U.S. should increase its research funding, said businessman and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The announcement comes at a time when many parts of the U.S. government are making AI announcements, even though the U.S. does not appear to have a fully functioning AI system.
At the same time, China launched its own ambition this year: it aims to become the world's number one AI manufacturer by 2030.
Increasing funding for AI research could be a good start, especially at a time when many countries are doing very well in the U.S. market, and we are looking at even greater AI performance", said Lee.
Increasing funding could increase the likelihood that the next AI boom will occur in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a major investor in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that was inspired by the famous American Othello, and later joined Microsoft Research and was a senior executive at Google in China.
Lee mentioned the long-running U.S. technology projects such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked what the next step should be, perhaps identifying people with knowledge of the subject.
Researchers in the U.S. will have to work hard to win federal funding, Lee said.
"It is not China that is taking the lead in education; it is the institutions", said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies over the years have recruited many employees from universities working on AI.
Lee said that the change in traffic laws could also help the U.S. to shake up its AI program.
"I think that green cards should be given only to those who have PhDs in AI projects", he said.
The State Council of China will be presenting the country's Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in June-July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation in China provides funding to the research community in much the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the impact of these studies is less in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department opened the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is tasked with bringing together staff from the departments of labor and education, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DAPRA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
But in terms of the NSF's contribution, it currently generates about $100 million a year in AI research.
On the other hand, the U.S. bill that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been seen in action in recent months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could end a decades - long dispute with Greece over its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has called the neighbouring country's left-wing name a symbol of its territorial dispute and has opposed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two sides reached an agreement in June on the new name, but opponents of the nationalist government said the name change would confuse the identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
Governor Gjoege Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that refusing to call the vote would raise doubts about whether the voter turnout would reach the 50 percent threshold needed for a referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Do you want membership in NATO and the EU and acceptance of the Greek referendum?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying a small price for Macedonia's membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO, a country that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for a national goal, for the youth of Macedonia to live in a free society within the European Union because it means a better life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje.
Although not universally applicable, many members of the legislature have said they will accept the results of the election so that the election will be held in a democratic manner.
A change of name requires the votes of at least three members of the legislature.
The polling agency said that no problems had been found in the polls as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was 16 percent compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections, which saw 34 percent of the electorate and 66 percent of registered voters participating.
"I came to vote for my children, our destination is Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, a 62 - year - old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would allow it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was preparing a stand and arranging seats in front of tents erected by protesters.
"We want to be in NATO and the EU, but we want to go in with our heads wide open, rather than going into the dark", said Kavadarkov.
"We are a nation of rich but important people.
If they don't want to be treated like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian alliance".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed economic growth to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I hope that the majority will support it because up to 80 percent of our people are in favor of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
They said that a "yes" vote would be the guarantee of our goal".
A poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia estimated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - a figure that is less than expected.
Another survey by Telma TV, Macedonian found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said that they would choose to approve.
For a referendum to pass, a minimum of 50 percent of the electorate is required to cast a single vote.
The failure to pass the referendum represents the biggest challenge to the constitutional legitimacy of the Eastern bloc since it came to power in June this year.
Image: Manchester City goalkeeper Sergio Aguero crosses the Brighton defensive line to make a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling lightened Brighton's defence in Saturday's 2-0 win against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look easy by scoring a goal in the 65th minute.
An Argentine goalkeeper receives the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He ran with the ball through two Brighton defenders before accepting an open spot.
Now Aguero was surrounded by four men dressed in full robes.
He passed one of the guards before rushing to throw the others at the end of the Brigthton's leather box.
He now turned to the left, and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first striker's ability to get the ball back into the box to Aguero who used his right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper and hit the ball to the right of the net.
"Aguero is fighting with the problem in his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told the radio.
"We said he was playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
We were fortunate that he had a good time".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first chance in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball inside the Brighton area of the game.
He sent a good ball to the left-back Leroy Sane.
Sane scored a few times and guided Sterling to the end of the penalty.
The Sky Blues' first goalkeeper threw the ball into the net just before he was about to leave the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wanted to play against the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to start over.
But the all-time winner Scherzer is hoping to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but otherwise the Rockies' one-game winning streak against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West is over.
The Rockies won the game 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night and will be looking to improve their record.
"Even if we play for nothing, we can still walk with pride knowing that the look here in Denver and the crowd and the other teams will play at the highest level that I will be able to reach this year.
Why not win the game?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting lineup for Sunday, but have reportedly expressed interest in allowing Scherzer to pick the stadium this time.
Scherzer, who is making his 34th start, will select the bench players on Thursday and will select the field players on Sunday during the regular break.
The Washington right-hander had an 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump meeting in West Virginia
The Governor was referring to the recent Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke of the Republican surge in the midterm elections.
"All our work can be thrown off in November.
Five weeks later our lives were in a terrible state of decline.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't stand for election but I do stand for the fact that I'm everywhere opposed to those who represent power, "he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible mob of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
They also want to take power by any means they can, to see violence, to be seen as a threat.
They do not care about the wounded, who are being wounded in order to gain strength and dominance, their desire is for power and redress, and we will not give in to them".
Trump said Democrats were on a difficult mission "to stop and compare".
"You can see what has happened in the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry and violent, disloyal and lying".
He also cited the Senate Judiciary Committee's decision to put Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the ballot, which drew a lot of attention from the crowd.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you distribute a leaflet without permission?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I was waiting for something - a body language - the most horrible body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a major party
It does not tolerate those who speak out of their own free will
When Momentum's supporters in my party voted to keep me in the party, it was no surprise.
However, I am one of the few senior leaders of the working group who have been told that they are not welcome - just for speaking our minds.
A friend of mine, Joan Ryan, a lawyer, was similarly persecuted because she refused to be involved in harassment.
For my part, the reason for my suspension was that I had refused to endorse Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of the law of economics in effecting, on the security of the country, the same arguments that Jeremy refused to support and the leadership of the press.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting announcement on Friday said that it was "looking forward to a more open and progressive meeting".
For most of the eight years that I have been a Labour MP, the GC meetings on Thursdays have been the same.
Unfortunately, today, the many meetings and promises of a gentle, gentle political message are often forgotten, if at all, they have begun.
It is now widely accepted that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every dispute is decided in accordance with the approval or disapproval of the party leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who shared my concerns at the time expected me to quickly change and accept a position I had never considered before - either in the field of national security or in the EU.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter how much I say it - there's a loud voice on the left saying I should be expelled, saying I should leave the middle class, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
Yet, I am not alone in the struggle.
I know that I have been more helpless than some of my fellow workers, for the words spoken against me seem to be an insult.
I am amazed at the hard work and endurance of my fellow workers, who endure so much pressure and pain day after day but never give up.
The most tragic thing about this time in political terms is the way in which the oppressor seems to be justified.
Jeremy Corbyn this week said that the Labour Party must have a policy of acceptance.
The fact is that we are no longer the great congregation that we once were and that whenever there is a law that is trustworthy, the congregation dwindles.
I have received so many calls in the past two years that I have been forced to keep my head down, to keep my mouth shut and then "just be safe".
But what about the matter of rules?
Since joining the Labour party 32 years ago as a student and the Thatcher government's oppressive and almost bankruptcy-inducing policy, I have been determined to work hard and give back to the people of the country who need it - whether as chancellor or as head of a government department.
I have never made a public statement about my political views, other than to say that I am a liberal.
No one in Nottingham East would be confused by my statements and some of the things I have shared about the current administration.
To those who supported this speech on Friday, I can only say that as the world looks ahead to Brexit which will disrupt many lives, businesses and our public services, I cannot understand this waste of time and energy on my commitment to the Labour leadership.
But the only hope I have is not to go to Nottingham Momentum, but to be in my own country, whether I belong to the Labour Party or not: I am committed to serving you and I promise that no threat or political pressure will prevent me from doing what I believe is right to do.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the undefeated Ayr go to the top
A two-Test draw would have ruined the final, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in what was a very interesting match that night in the Tennent Premiership.
Now they are on high, the only undefeatable group of all that exists.
In the end it was their turn to win, as well as to take their chances, which led to their victory and their coach Peter Murchie having all the privileges to feel good.
"We have been tested in our games up to this point, and we have not been defeated, so I can be proud.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose party said: "All credit to Ayr, he has used his opportunities better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute penalty, played by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was cleared by the Warriors to play the game, allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggot to take the penalty in the unofficial fixture.
Ayr's play was improved by a penalty, then, at halftime, he was forced to change his own tackle to make the score 17-5 to Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose's second quarter started well as Patrick Anderson scored, and Baggot added, reducing the gap to five.
There was a long wait due to the injury of Ruidhar Knott, who was ejected, and when they started again, Ayr moved forward through the arc that had hit Stafford McDowall, and another entrance to Climo.
Ayr's substitute captain, Blair Macpherson, was then sent off, but Melrose made a strong pass attempt, but the ball from Bruce Colvine was blocked, ending in a hard-fought shootout.
The home side came up with a strong run, and when Struan Hutchinson was given the ball for attacking Climo without the ball, from the penalty area, MacPherson came up with the ball down the back of Ayr's goal.
He again made a late pass, as he had done in most of the rest of the season, then Kyle Rowe came in to catch David Armstrong's shot and gave the receiver Gregor Henry a fifth in the owners' game.
The Still Game actress seems ready to take on a new career as a food service worker
Still Game actor Ford Kieran seemed poised to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he had been appointed as the CEO of the company.
The 56 - year - old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC series, which he writes and stars in with his longtime friend Greg Hemphill.
The two men said the upcoming ninth series would be the last to air, and it appeared that Kiernan was preparing for his life after Craiglang.
According to the company's employer directory, he is the president of Adriftmorn Limited.
The sports star declined to comment on the matter, although sources told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan was looking to join a successful restaurant chain in Glasgow".
'Help our ocean people': Bolivia, surrounded by other countries, hopes that the treaty will open the way to the Pacific
The large harbor of La Paz was the crossing point for the pirates.
All buildings in the country will display the blue flags of the sea.
A sign at the entrance to the shipping channel from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon reads: "Woe to our own sea.
It is our duty to protect him".
Across Bolivia, the memory of the archipelago that Chile won in the bloody wars of the 19th century is still fresh in mind - as is the desire to plunder ships in the Pacific Ocean.
This hope has been growing for decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia is a country of strength, unity and patience, and of hope", said Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian ambassador.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ ruling on the country's major criminal cases, hoping that the regional court in The Hague will sympathize with Bolivia's claim that - decades from now - Chile should agree to negotiate Bolivia's access to the Sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's religious leader and a candidate for reelection this year, has strong support in Monday's vote.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", they declared in late June.
But some analysts say the court may not have made a difference in Bolivia's national well-being - and that it would have made little difference if it had.
The UN mission in the Netherlands has no mandate to grant the Chilean space, and will not be involved in any discussions there.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes after the final hearing shows that the case is not resolved, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the process of reform for the Bolivian people, it seems that the last four years have been a setback.
"The question of access to the sea is being ignored by the current administration in Bolivia", said Zárate.
Morales' military dictatorship has finally stripped Chile of all its good qualities, they said.
Bolivia and Chile may be able to negotiate for a while, but it will be very difficult to resume negotiations after that.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomats since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's proceedings were too long.
Monday will give Bolivia "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance "to end 139 years of economic isolation,  they said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular leaders - used the maritime dispute as a political platform.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"A trial can be an opportunity when we need a way out of the past".
North Korea has said that denuclearization will not happen unless it trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Ministry official Ri Yong Ho said his country would not be able to develop nuclear energy without the trust of Washington.
Ri made this statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
They are calling on the United States to honor the commitments it made at the Singapore summit between the warring leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to launch a new round of nuclear talks three months after the conclusion of the Singapore talks with Kim Jong Un in North Korea.
Ri said it was a "false dream" that continued U.S. sanctions and a refusal to end the Korean War could cause the North to retreat.
Washington is concerned about the approval of Pyongyang's first talks to begin the process of unblocking the country.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump were planning to hold a second summit.
But there are doubts that Pyongyang would be willing to give up what it sees as its only hope of security.
Pompeo was planning to visit Pyongyang for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
A Paris fashion show features the latest in luxury fashion being introduced to the High Street near you
If you need to add a layer of protection to your helmet or sunscreen, do not go too far.
Valentino and Thom Browne's designers unveiled the caps in a street-side SS19 assembly that opened the show at Paris Fashion Week.
The most beautiful crowns are appearing on Instagram this summer and the designers have sent beautiful designs to all the places and all the streets.
The most beautiful of Valentino's crowns was a large blue crown with a fur-like border that neatly covered the head of a goat.
Other common features include a water-resistant cap, a dragon-like crown and a dragon-like head - but these are not designed to generate heat.
Thom Browne also revealed the facial features - just before Halloween.
Many of the masks had a lip that was turned and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the objects resembled scuba diving gear with a tube and glass, and the other resembled a bowl of ice cream.
And if you can add a business word to the long dress - you're lucky.
The scouts say that these large masses are now moving toward the streets nearest you.
The large, elegant hats worn over the 'La Bomba' style high heels, the double-headed straw hat, are seen on the heads of many from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Another popular attraction was the circular cap with its distinctive design - a large-colored, hatlike carriage that symbolized the wearer.
The raiffia orange hat, featuring a number of embroidery patterns and a leather cap with a thick brim, was featured in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
That is what designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and women on the highway next summer - when the designer is so famous that it will be difficult to undo the curtains of the big furniture.'
John Edward: Knowledge of the local area is very important to citizens around the world.
Scotland's independent schools continue to be at the forefront of academic performance, and this is especially true in 2018 with a very strong academic outcome, which has been boosted by the commitment and collaboration of individuals in sport, the arts, music and other social activities.
With the number of students in Scotland now approaching 30,000, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are struggling to provide quality education and services for students and parents.
Schools that serve them are focused on preparing students for higher education, for careers that they want and for their place as citizens of the world.
As a field of study that can develop and achieve a complete curriculum, we see how new areas are increasingly required as subjects in our schools.
"If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head", said Nelson Mandela.
If I speak to him in his native language, it reaches his heart".
This is a good reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's examinations, we can see that the regions are at the top of the rankings of the schools that are doing well.
Up to 68 percent of the students who study foreign languages are able to reach the level of the Upper A Level.
The report, taken from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students passed the Class A exam in Mandarin, 72 percent of those taking German, 69 percent of those taking French and 63 percent of those taking Spanish.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland are providing the rest of the country with the essential resources that children and youths will need in the future.
Subjects, as an elective subject, are now considered to be equivalent to science or STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curriculum of private and public schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of job losses were due to lack of skills.
Thus, increased knowledge of the languages is essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
At a time when many jobs require linguists, this skill will be a part of the collaborative world.
It does not matter what career one chooses, as long as one has learned a second language, one will have the opportunity to have a permanent job in the future.
Being able to communicate with people of other nationalities gives a polyglot an advantage over others.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of respondents failed to speak a foreign language in a meaningful conversation with others, with French being the language spoken by 15% of the population.
This is why it is so important to invest in language education for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those of developing countries, will help children to find meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school has its own dialect.
Some schools will focus on new languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as key to the UK's future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's needs, there will be many options for schools to serve, and teachers will be welcomed in this area.
The Scottish Independent Schools are committed to creating an educational environment that prepares children for the skills they need to thrive, whatever their future may be.
It cannot be denied that at present, in the global economic arena, nations are becoming increasingly economically powerful, and this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern-day languages should be considered "as a global comparison".
The schools that serve them will continue to provide this opportunity, increasing the number of pupils and improving the education of Scotland's young people.
We need to be diligent.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron making his first start for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is now over for the fans who have been waiting for LeBron James to make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the team's opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the exact number of minutes he will spend there is not yet known.
"It could be more than a minute and less than 48 minutes", Wallton said on the Lakers' website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudell tweeted that James appeared to be playing the right minutes.
Following the player's preparation this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"I don't need a game show at this stage of my career to be ready", he replied.
The time of the Trump Summit in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is set to begin his presidential campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This was one of five events that Trump organized over the next week, including shopping centers in populated areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his vote count expected to fill the Supreme Court seat, Trump was seeking to boost support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of the House when the elections are held in November.
What time is the Trump Summit in West Virginia tonight and how can you start online?
The schedule for the Trump Summit in West Virginia will be released at 7 p.m. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the West Virginia Trump rally via YouTube live stream.
Trump was expected to speak at this week's Supreme Court hearing on the Brett Kavanaugh case, which is particularly contentious over the alleged rape of a pregnant woman as a vote on the matter is pending until next week as the FBI investigates.
But the main thrust of all these meetings is to help Republicans prepare for the upcoming November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign for the next election this week is focused on "empowering those who have surrendered and support Republicans to try to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress leadership is demanding that the president go to a lot of places as we enter a critical election season", said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who declined to be named, Reuters reported.
Scheduled to be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and a sizable radio audience in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second day of the month that Trump visits the state of West Virginia, despite the state's winning of more than 40 percent of the vote in the 2016 election.
Trump was trying to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who was unopposed in the election.
"It is not a good example for Mr. Morrisey that the president should come to his party to help him get more votes", said Simon Haeder, a political science professor at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcases fighting strength to maintain the hopes as Sunday's one-off match approaches
After three straight one-sided games, Saturday's 4/4 draw may be what the Ryder Cup needs.
The rotation of the pendulum of momentum is a new and sometimes controversial topic in the sports world, and it is a major competitive issue.
So where is the momentum now?
"It's up with six boats and now we've got four, so we expect that to be a strong increase", said Jordan Spieth as he stood up at the end of the evening.
The fact is, Europeans were lucky, we had a four-point lead with twelve games left.
The Americans, according to Spieth, were considered to have a lot of spirit to push forward and had a lot of motivation, including Spieth and Justin Thomas who worked all day and wore three hats each.
Spieth is the only one who has successfully introduced a new color from tee to green as an example.
The excitement of the game grew as his game progressed, with a difficult match between four boats in each game and Thomas and himself playing a game of two-two.
His team won the 15th edition of the tournament without a single loss, a celebration that would have made him believe that the American team would not be eliminated from the tournament.
"You have to be willing to sacrifice your passion and concern for your game", said Spieth.
Each of the teachers in the crowd had a piece of bread.
18 holes for the construction of the castle.
The players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legend.
The two Europeans are in the 4th division out of 4 and are not to be confused.
"Mr. Moliwood" was the only person who could not get a bogey on Saturday night, but also refused to hit bogey on Saturday morning, on Friday night and on Friday morning.
That run, and the power of their performance in front of a crowd, ensured that the players won on Sunday, and no other famous golfer could have won in Europe at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
What happens at once is in the opposite direction.
Yet, it is still not appropriate to speak of the glory of Europe.
The performances of Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson gave a limited appearance to Sergio Garcia, who was the morning's winner, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey hit two doubles in the bottom of the ninth kept the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they were unable to escape.
On Sunday, however, no one helped him out of the pit.
The 4th and 4th movements are also known as the close movements because of the relationship between the two movements, the relative positions they give, the relative positions they do not give and the way the stars can move in a short period of time.
The Europeans have been playing well as a team so far and are on the bottom as they enter the final day but the fourth and fourth games of the season show that Team USA also have the ability to play against what some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europeans lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe had a good chance as they entered the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning Saturday's 4 - 4 game with a 10 - 6 lead over the United States.
Two young champions, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the way to a double-digit win over Tiger Woods, who added four more points at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorn, determined to recover the trophy he had lost at Hazeltine two years earlier, led the American champions in the morning's 4-4 draw, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. team was trying to improve on its 4 - 4 record, winning two games, but it was unable to reach the playoffs.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight of the 12 seeds in Sunday's game to win the title.
Fleetwood became the first European player to win four consecutive titles when he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the weekend's tough play, managed to win only four in four consecutive matches since the Ryder Cup began.
After defeating Woods by Patrick Reed in a 4-4 game and a strong win over a fractured Woods, the American Bryson Dechambeau scored a 5-4 victory.
Woods, who had been a latecomer in the two Saturday games, has shown some improvement in the past but has now won 19 of his 29 games in four and four out of seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who retired from the 4-4 game earlier in the day, came back to tie Henrik Stenson in the 4-4 game and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1 respectively, who are ranked No. 1 and No. 3 in the world.
Not all Europeans were surprised by this beautiful, westerly wind of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record by sailing two boats on Saturday.
They had a 2-1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a 4-4 draw and a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4-4 draw after two holes of golf were opened.
There have been two Ryder Cup legends where a team came back from a 4-game losing streak to go one-on-one, even though the Furyk team needed a draw to retain the trophy.
After being second in the best-ever days, however, it seems that Sunday's game will be a difficult one.
North Korea says there is 'no way' it can unilaterally extract power from its nuclear reactors
Foreign observers in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions were reinforcing U.S. suspicion that the country would not be able to abandon its nuclear weapons program in the wake of the events.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "exceptional steps" in the past year, including abandoning nuclear tests, destroying the test site and not adding nuclear weapons to the arsenal.
"We do not, however, see any response from the U.S"., they said.
"If there is no trust in the U.S. there will be no trust in our national security and thus no way to achieve our own nuclear deterrence".
As Ri echoed North Korea's widespread complaint about Washington's refusal to accept the "clear" path to denuclearization that North Korea could follow if it takes the next step, his words sounded stronger in the sense that he did not oppose the denuclearization of Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to the words of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever meeting between the U.S. and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to provide a comprehensive security framework for North Korea.
North Korea is exploring the possibility of ending the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States considers the capital city of Pyongyang to be a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
Washington also rejects the North Korean sanctions.
"The U.S. has insisted on "first denuclearization" and then increased its enforcement through a tightening of sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive manner, as well as rejecting "the termination of hostilities"," they said.
"To think that a ban will allow us to overcome is an unfulfilled dream of people who do not know us well.
But the problem is that the addition of restrictions only increases our distrust".
Ri spoke about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader announced at the United Nations earlier this week.
The president's press secretary, referring to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, added: "If the talk of denuclearisation is more South Korean than U.S., denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is not as strong".
However, Ri's comments are different from those he made this year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea's plans for the U.S. were inevitable after "Bad President" Trump called Kim a "man of plans" on the coup.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who has vowed to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was more work to be done and the sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump did not have a timetable for the project, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months - don't worry".
China and Russia have said that the U.N. Security Council should release Pyongyang for the steps it has not taken.
Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue until we can be certain that nuclear disarmament is complete, and it is a certainty".
The Security Council has increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to limit the cost of nuclear weapons.
Pompeo met Ri during the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again this coming month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July with the impression that things were going well, but within hours North Korea came to the rescue and claimed that they were making "a threat as big as a dragon".
North Korea has vowed to meet Moon this month to dismantle its nuclear weapons and weapons programs if the United States takes "serious steps".
He said Kim was told that the "serious steps" he wanted to take were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore and the work needed to improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students begin a course of study with adequate rest
A new study at Harvard University this year has led new students to take more naps in order to counteract a practice known as macho that involves people reading all day long under the influence of caffeine.'
One teacher found that students in a large international school spend many hours without knowledge of the scriptures on the subject of keeping their lives in balance.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the study, which he says is the first of its kind in the US.
She was encouraged to start the study after discussing how sleep deprivation can interfere with learning.
'At the end of their talk a girl came up and said: 'Why am I being told this in the middle of my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him anything about the importance of sleep - much to my surprise, the Telegraph reported.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of healthy eating habits for academic and athletic performance, as well as for improving quality of life.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the school's health department, said that the school decided to conduct the study after finding that students were sleep deprived during the week.
This hour-long study includes a number of interactive activities.
One section includes a picture of a bedroom, where students are placed on a bed of paper, books and books to be reminded of the function of light and lighting and how the speed of the operation is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleeping during the test.
In another article, students were taught that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, anxiety, and cancer.
The school map, with its accompanying diagram, also encourages students to reflect on their daily routine.
'we know that it will not change the character of the disciples immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health risks of smoking,' added Prof. Czeisler.
The proud trend of 'training in reading' is still there, they said, adding that the current trends and the increase in dismissals among students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, long-term sleep is perhaps the most important step for students to take to combat hunger, fatigue, and stress, they say - or even to reduce weight, since sleep deprivation causes the brain to be starved, causing the students to feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the study, after studying one of his papers during his junior year at Harvard.
She said that the study opened her eyes and encouraged her to make a commitment to the education of all students at the school.
The next step, they hope, is to ask all graduating students if they would like to learn this kind of lesson before entering a highly competitive industry.
Prof Czeisler urged students to consider setting a sleep alarm, as well as a wake-up time, and to be aware of the dangers of blue light emitted from televisions and LEDs, which can disrupt the normal sleep patterns, and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The catcher brings the Gerrards to the ground
The Rangers were again defeated at home when Dolly Menga's goal scored to upset Steven Gerrard's united side in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side are looking for their first win since their 4-1 win at St. Johnsone in January, but Gary Holt's team have been challenging for a second successive win for Gerrard in 18 games as captain to put his side eight points ahead of Premiership leaders Ladbrokes Hearts.
Menga scored with seven minutes to go and the Rangers were out of position.
With the Rangers now back in sixth place, Livingston is three behind Hibernian in the points standings.
The Rangers also appeared to be in trouble after the club's captain Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after a projectile was thrown from the pitch.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team that defeated Ayr and reached the semifinals of the Betfre Cup.
Holt's side, on the other hand, went with the same Liv 11 that took Hearts to the top this week and were also pleased to see how their well-behaved side had overpowered their opponents.
The Rangers had a lot of time to play with the ball, but Livingston was the one who used the ball well.
They had to go through two minutes of extra time when the first penalty by Menga sent Scott Pittman over Allan McGregor's basket but the midfielder opened his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs's shot went to goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow managed to kick the ball back into the goal.
The Rangers started to get the ball back but there seemed to be more hope than acceptance of their play in the third period.
Alfredo Morelos feels he should have been given a penalty for the one-hour stoppage when he and Steven Lawless fought but pitcher Steven Thomson refused to complain to the Colombian.
Rangers scored two goals on the field, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unharmed by a header from Lassana Coulibaly and a tackle from Ovie Ejaria.
When Livi's 34 - minute goal was to match the time, no one doubted that the ball was needed because of the size of the ball.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to match the team's rival, Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not say anything as Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was determined to take Menga to the easy end.
Gerrard served time on a break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the trade caused controversy when the quarterback was traded to Morelos while coach Kelly fled from his hometown to a different city.
But Livingston continued to follow the visitors to their favorite ballpark, with Lithgow and Halket topping the list.
Holt's team took the lead in the final frame but McGregor stopped Jacobs before Lithgow could hit the ball from a distance.
Rangers midfielder Glenn Middleton again has a penalty shot against Jacobs but again Thomson looks the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Here is a page from our "Sunday Morning" newspaper, the Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THIS is the date on which the German mathematician Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the development of the Geiger counter.
A pillar of scientific excellence from its inception, the Geiger Counter also became a cultural icon, as in the 1950 series "Bells of Coronado", featuring some of the greatest scientific achievements including Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Person: "What is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger Counter, which is used to measure the radioactivity of certain minerals, such as uranium.
If you put these in your ear, you can feel the energy of the atoms in the rocks that are created by the radioactivity inside".
Evans: "So you say it was designed!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the vessel bearing his name still exists.
A new anti-cancer drug can train the immune system to 'find' cancer cells
A new anti-cancer drug can train the immune system to "see" and kill cancer cells
A vaccine that trains the immune system to recognize cancer cells as a potential treatment
This process involves taking immune cells from a patient, and transferring them to a laboratory
It can then 'break' a protein common in many cancers and replicate it in the body
An investigational drug is showing promise in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which helps the immune system to detect cancer cells, was surprised to find that her testicular cancer had survived for more than 18 months.
The method is being developed by taking immune cells from the patient, processing them in the laboratory to "detect" a protein common in many cancers called HER2, and then implanting it in the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our data are a beacon of hope for a very effective vaccine".
HER2 "is involved in many types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar technique of taking immune cells from patients and "training" them to attack cancer cells has been used to treat a rare form of leukemia.
Kanye West begins a tribute to Trump for his "Pink" vocals, while wearing a MAGA Hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It Did Not Work
Kanye West was invited to his Saturday Night Live show after a performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and his candidacy in the 2020 election.
After singing his third song of the night, Ghost Town in a Make America Great mask, he sang loudly and insulted Democrats and spoke in support of Trump.
"Many times when I talk to white people they say: 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
It's just, if racism is something that bothers me, I'm leaving America", he said.
SNL began its show with Hollywood comedian Matt Damon making jokes about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee about his alleged attempted rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast on radio, West's performance was broadcast on the same network as comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock was the one who beat West by throwing the sausage at the table.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had difficulty striking me because of the headgear.
"I have been through a lot lately.
'You come in the front with that shirt on,' they say.
They are very cruel to me!
And they also thought I was in a deserted area", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see a safe place?" and "I'm wearing my victory hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to see the world move forward?
This is love".
Her comments caused a public backlash and the SNL audience seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the paper: "The whole studio was silent".
West was originally slated to replace Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, singer Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many by singing I Love it, dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West was inspired by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of those brave souls: I'm going to die in the name of the WITCH".
But the show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "has shown a lot of character and it's been great".
"But I choose NOT to hire someone (either by buying his music or his clothes or by promoting his "motorcycle") who I know is carrying and distributing harmful material to my community.
He was free.
It's the same for us", he added.
Before the show, the singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the same person as Kanye West".
No musician is the first to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another artist, Snoop Dogg, adopted the stage name Snoop Lion and the musician Prince, adopted the stage name of Prince's former bandmate.
Convicted of attempted murder in the Belfast bombing

The case is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The cases will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington is furious at those who have a problem with women's rights
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old, who is a chubby, is furious at the macho hero's overweight body, saying that this show's obscenity means that boys must be tough to get respect.
In her interview with the Sunday Culture Times, Kit suggested that there was something wrong with her and wanted to know how to stop the abuse of women in the current #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, said that she felt she had to 'work harder' to cope.
'I feel for myself, that I should work harder, now - what about the mistakes we made because of our strength as men?' he said.
'What do we teach boys as they grow up, given the current crisis?'
Kit said that the porn industry is responsible for the rise in male violence because of the number of men who are exposed to violence.
He asked: 'What are we born with and what are we taught?
Is it the media, the streets, or the media that makes boys feel that they have to be that way in order to be men?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time - can we change this disease?
'There must be something wrong with the boys.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be interested in making a repeat or a one-off of Game of Thrones when the current series ends next summer, and said that he would 'abstain from games and fights with the monkeys'.
From November Kit will appear in the Sam Shepard's True West series, which is about a cartoonist and his blind brother.
The actor has revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so in this way this show has created my future family and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of the title character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning show.
The two were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a new infection rate of 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to the elderly population.
A total of 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of the people who had been baptized responded by going to the meetings, as opposed to the usual route.
In the past, the transmission of HIV in China was mainly by blood transfusion.
But the number of new infections in this way has now been brought down to near zero, health officials said at a meeting in Yunnan Province.
Compared to previous years, however, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has risen to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a major issue in China, where many LGBT people are sexually active.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the persecution of LGBT people is reported to be much worse.
Because of the country's unique culture and values, studies have found that 70-90% of men who have sex with men do not end up sexually abusing women.
Most viral infections occur because of the over-protection that exists in this relationship.
Beginning in 2003, the Chinese government promised to give all citizens access to HIV vaccines as part of its response.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP senator's story was 'dangerously false' and 'suspicious'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted the biographies of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages of the bill.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by "right-wing" political journalists and websites.
"Lies, lies to the core, lies to the core", Waters said in a Twitter post.
The broadcast was reported to include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The story, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on the alleged rape of newly elected Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, appeared online on Thursday.
The rumor was spread after three senators had finished questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the sender was shared with Waters's office and disseminated information about Waters's employee, Hill's paper said.
"This unproven suspicion is a gross and blatant lie", Waters said.
"My servant - whom you have confused with signs, a fellow story, and a prisoner because of your trickery and false witness - did not in fact spread this story.
"This unproven suspicion is a gross and blatant lie.
Waters's brief statement has been widely shared online, including by White House correspondent Ari Fleischer.
"This is a denial of anger", Fleischer wrote.
"This means that he has no desire to be a member of the Law Society.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not become angry.
He should not be justified in his anger.
He did not have to ask why the one who was insulting him was standing there.
"It is necessary to be mild and to have a mild temper".
Fleischer was trying to match Waters's anger with Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is standing for the Republican ticket to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
"This is great if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Ms. Waters said her office had "concerned those who were involved and those who worked in law enforcement in relation to this allegedly unjust crime.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found", they said, "but also that they are held accountable for their destructive and dangerous acts against both the individual and their agents".
Johnny English Returns - a comedy by Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to refer to Brexit in a broad sense in the new British comedy franchise Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would it be a funny joke to talk about how we as a country have a problem with the privilege of exporting our goods?
In any case, Johnny English's famous eyes, the unmistakable face of a second time entertainer, have been raised - a title that shows that he is proud above all as one of the entertainers who make up the non - English - speaking world of entertainment.
One user of the 100 idiots will entertain you with a fun little trick called the Little Inspector, in imitation of Mr Bean and in a manner similar to the man who contributed his voice to the Chariots of Fire song at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
And at first he relied on the mobile and international Atkinson man who was present in the now-forgotten show that brought the Barclaycard TV news, who watched the trouble wherever he went.
There are one or two positive aspects to the new JW broadcasting program.
I was thrilled to see Johnny English in his old-fashioned military suit approach the helicopter with the wings of the plane gently tapping his nose.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is evident, but at times comedy seems to be under-powered and sometimes over-the-top, especially when series such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now available as extras.
The comedy is generally seen as more youthful than adult, and many episodes involving Johnny English lack the comic elements of Atkinson's comedy, where he takes the place of Bean.
The theme of this year's report is that Great Britain is in a state of crisis.
A cybercriminal has infiltrated the UK's secret intelligence network, exposing the identities of all the British diplomatic agents involved, much to the surprise of someone on duty at the time - a rare feat for Kevin Eldon.
This is a difficult situation for a proud and vulnerable prime minister, who is struggling with the weakness of its leadership and the popularity of its policies: Emma Thompson has done well in the role of quasi-Teresa-May but not much in the role of a role model.
Their supervisors were told that all the jobs that they had been involved in were to be returned to those who had given up.
This means including the very controversial Johnny English, who now serves as the principal of a school, but gives a few tips on how to be anonymous: one of the funniest is when English teaches magic classes at the School of Rock.
English is then escorted to Whitehall for a press conference and meets his former partner Bough, a position also occupied by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, and is buried with the ship's first captain, the well-known lady whose Vicki Pepperdine looked so tired.
The inevitable deterioration of Her Majesty's Secret Service was overshadowed by the appointment of Ophelia Bulletova as the new replacement for Olga Kurylenko.
On the other hand, the prime minister is being lured by a wealthy financier who claims to be the answer to Britain's financial woes: the menace of Jason Volta, a post held by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough's imaginary journey begins: posing as a waitress, they are seduced by a French restaurant; they take a ride on the escape on Volta's luxury yacht; and English is a tourist as he tries to use Virtual Reality headsets to get a better understanding of the design of Volta's house.
All the background has been removed so that the fun is not too long in coming, but while it is interesting and entertaining in this way, the childish aspects are still in the main story.
A little more.
And like so many Johnny English films I wonder: why would the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would allow her to use her talents to the fullest?
The Labour Party has rejected a proposal to make the British work four days a week and receive five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week - but with a five-day paycheck.
The company reportedly wants corporate executives to withdraw the money earned through artificial intelligence (AI) and give it to employees by giving them an extra day off.
This will give workers three days off on the weekend - for a four - dollar wage.
Our speakers said that these plans would be appropriate for the current government and the plan to change the world for the betterment of the working people.
The move to a four-day work week was supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way to make workers feel better during the economic crisis.
A Labour official told the Sunday Times: 'The revision of the text is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not be a short but a 4-day work week of projects that are in line with the party's commitment to improving the living conditions of the working class and the country's economic development plans.'
Labour will not be the first to achieve this goal, while the Green Party will have promised a four-day working week in the run-up to the 2017 general election.
However, these plans are not fully supported by the Labour Party.
'The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not even a party concept,' said a Labour Party spokesman.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used this week's Labour Party convention to revive his vision of economic and business power.
McDonnell said he was very willing to take power away from the "unintended managers" and "the greedy" in the private sector.
The plans were a shadow chancellor and meant that shareholders in other water companies might not be able to recover their full share of the money because the Labour government could lose some money for some of the wrongdoing.
They also support the formation of corporate training schemes and the creation of Inclusive Ownership Funds to provide 10 per cent of the company's equity to employees, who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change his mind
The FBI investigation into the case against Judge Brett Kavanaugh and the delay in the vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by one week, raises the question of whether the investigator's findings could influence the Republican senators' decision to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham of the Republican Party if the FBI could find any evidence that would change their mind.
Even Kennedy seemed to be more flexible than his South Carolina colleagues.
"I think it can be done", said Kennedy.
"I have been to the trial, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I sent for him when the incident happened and asked him, 'Is this suspect here?'
He was brave, determined, and unwavering".
Graham's vote, however, seems unlikely to change.
"My mind is fixed on Brett Kavanaugh and otherwise the power of the mob will be shaken", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett is resisting", added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"Anyone who can prove himself cannot prove himself.
That was 36 years ago.
I have never seen anything new or exciting".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday in New York there will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring a variety of musicians, followed by the ultimate goal; to end the scourge of global warming.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only hear the music of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the potential of music to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a global movement that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who participate in the fight against poverty.
To qualify for a free ticket (or to purchase a VIP ticket), prospective viewers must complete a set of unlisted tasks, or "activities" such as volunteering for a mission, sending an e - mail to a consul, making a telephone call or any other activity that would make the mission unpopular.
But has the Global Citizen project achieved anything in the 12 years since it began?
Is giving people free concert tickets a way to force people to ask for a service or is it just another "click-to-make" - people feel like they're doing something by signing up for a chat or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported over 19 million contributions from supporters, calling for more work to be done.
The project, he said, has helped to push world leaders to announce a $37 billion budget and a plan to reach $2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 pledges and announcements for its activities, of which about $10 billion was raised and distributed.
The group says that the funds raised have helped some 649 million people worldwide.
Among the pledges is that The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. corporate social enterprise aimed at "helping children reach their potential", has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country's food shortage after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, governments, and global citizens like you, we can work towards making food security a global issue", The Power of Nutrition spokesperson Tracey Ullman told a panel of people attending a concert in London in September 2018.
The group also noted that after more than 5,000 petitions were launched to urge the U.K. government to improve the lives of mothers and their children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition initiative, which will reach 5 million mothers and children with the help of good grades.
In response to the FAQ on their website "what makes you think we can end the worst of the worst?"
Global Citizen responded: "It is a long and difficult process - sometimes we fail and sometimes we fail.
But as a group of people fighting for the rights of the races, we are finally victorious, because when we work together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe were among the performers at this year's concert in New York City, which will be headlined by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US government may use Navy as "protection" against Russian interference - Secretary of State
Washington could "use naval forces if necessary" to block Russian supplies from entering markets, including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that the Russian-Syrian relationship - apparently, where he was acting on the call of a legitimate government - was a mere speculation that had no basis in the search for weapons.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to talk about energy issues like they are in eastern Europe, southern Europe", he said.
So, according to the governor, there is a way to do it.
"The United States has the ability, through our Navy, to ensure that our sea lanes are open, and if necessary closed, to ensure that their cargoes do not enter the country", he said.
Zinke was speaking to an audience at a conference organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an organization that has been called "the voice of the consumer energy industry" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's actions with those of Russia and Iran, saying that they were similar.
"The project has had a financial impact on Iran and Russia, which are increasingly, or decreasingly, exploiting and replacing fossil fuels", they said, referring to Russia as "a champion in one respect" in relying solely on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is seeking to increase the supply of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, to meet the demands of European consumers.
Because of this, the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, is trying to pressure Germany to withdraw from the "unfair" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, has left Moscow "slave" to Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly called the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is expected to add 110 billion cubic meters of gas to the existing pipeline, a business development project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's refusal to participate was motivated by commercial considerations and was an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we reject the idea that energy cannot be a weapon of coercion and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US government's efforts have attracted considerable criticism from Germany which has expressed its re-commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the German trade union federation, has called on the US government to distance itself from the EU's energy clauses and to negotiate a deal between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very difficult when a big country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "Reviewed Very Well" for Standing in the 2020 Presidential Election, Says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Saturday said she should "consider seriously" whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren made sure that he was considering a candidacy.
"It's time for our women to go to Washington and fix the broken system and what it means for women to be in the top leadership", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider running for president".
Warren accused President Donald Trump of "leading the country into the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about the way Donald Trump is dealing with our basic rights", he said.
Warren is among the most vocal critics of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "we definitely need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that many people, including Warren's running mate, did not think she should run in the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts said Warren should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
As many as 32 percent supported such a stand.
The poll showed overwhelming support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting his candidacy and 48% opposing it.
Other top names in the Democratic field could be expected to contest the 2020 presidential election with Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make the decision by January, Associated Press reports
Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD by Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a violent crime that occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through on his return, is comparable to other families going through the stress of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers come back with", he told a crowd attending Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that the kidnapping was like "the lion in the room" and that her son and the other soldiers, "come back strong, come back brave, come back with the doubt that there is still the same respect that there is for fellow soldiers, airmen, and all the other soldiers, who are returning to their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of assaulting a woman, disrupting a police line and possessing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 cities, D.C. support the release of a new human immunity measure
Eighteen cities and the District of Columbia are supporting the passage of a new U.S. federal law that prohibits the admission and protection of refugees from violent or unwelcome persecution.
Representatives from 18 states and one state wrote a friend-of-the-court statement in Washington on Friday in support of a refugee claimant who is challenging the text, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions in which the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint in February against the statute was not disclosed.
She claimed that her friend and "the children of her gang members" were harassing her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was sentenced to life in prison in Texas.
The city's lawyers, who are in favor of Grace, described the El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala regions as a major source of asylum seekers from the U.S. government, as they are the most vulnerable to the tyranny of the indigenous population.
The new U.S. immigration policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for immigration.
Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new law "revolutionizes the decades-old policy of national and international cities".
"The constitution requires that any security claim may be adjudicated on the basis of certain facts and circumstances of the security claim, and the prohibition is in accordance with this provision", the friend-of-the court said.
The prosecutor also argued that this clause of separation between immigrants and the U.S. economy was a disorder, that immigrants could become business partners and "provide services that are needed".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions led immigration judges in offering asylum to those fleeing the oppression of crime and domestic violence during the month of August.
"Vaccination is available to those who have left their country because of persecution or intimidation on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", said Sessions in his 11th General Prayer when announcing the text.
This vaccine is not designed to solve all the problems - even the most complex problems - that people face every day around the world.
The search and rescue of survivors continued in Palu as the death toll rose
For those who survived, the situation was not good.
"It sounds difficult", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she laid her newborn baby at the shelter for survivors of the disaster-hit city of Palu.
"Every time the ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a lack of fresh water".
The inhabitants seemed to be returning to their ruined homes, picking up some of the things that had been lost in the flood, trying to get what they could.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and a broken shoulder, were lying outside the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated for the aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the earthquake that shook the fifth floor of the hotel where he and his wife and child lived.
"We had no time to save ourselves.
I think I was trapped in the collapsed walls", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city at the time.
"I heard my wife screaming, and there was a silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe".
U.S. ambassador accuses China of being a "persecutor" through "extreme propaganda"
Just a week after the Chinese newspaper published a U.S. advert discussing the benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade relations, U.S. ambassadors to China surrounded Beijing with American newspapers to spread a critical message.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday addressed the China Daily and its Des Moines Register - Iowa's largest newspaper - after he called for China's interference in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a cause China has rejected.
Trump's suggestion that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election has been confirmed by some U.S. officials who told Reuters that Washington is using a new strategy to impose pressure on China.
While it is good for the world to put trade tariffs in the news, Beijing and Washington are in a bitter trade war that has led to higher tariffs on imports from one country to another.
Taxes on Chinese goods earlier this year were introduced to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican campaign, said Chinese business observers.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime Governor of Iowa, said Beijing was a "great mistake" for American workers, farmers and businessmen.
"China is now adding to the pressure by putting a heavy dose of propaganda in our free papers", Branstad wrote in a column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"Through its expensive advertising, the Chinese government is exposing the American free speech with a billboard advertising for money in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, at a news desk on a street in Beijing, you find little to no criticism and no criticism of the Chinese people's seemingly declining business prospects, and of the fact that the media in China is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", they wrote.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China has refused to publish" his article, though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans Segregate Women Voters in the Midterm Election Leadership on Kavanaugh, Which Warns Reviewers of the News
At a time when many Republicans were supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who was implicated in the rape of a pregnant woman, news analysts predicted that there would be more attacks, especially against women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The controversy surrounding the issue was at its height, with many Republicans saying they were ready to accept the nomination.
That is something that cannot be tested", Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in a Saturday edition.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) unprecedented push for an FBI investigation would inflame the anger of angry voters.
"Mothers will never forget yesterday - never forget tomorrow and never forget November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior campaigner and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate chamber as the Republican Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The Democrats' motivation and enthusiasm is in the record", Stu Rothenberg, a freelance news reviewer, told an online newspaper.
"People say it's a farce; it's true.
But it is even more so, especially among women and young people who are voters in the regions where they live, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, are not voting".
Even before Ford gave a deposition to testify about his alleged rape case before the Supreme Court, news analysts said there would be a strike if Republicans pressed for a conviction.
"This has become a major problem for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, the executive director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told a news conference.
However, Americans appeared divided over the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh and many supported Kavanaugh.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents agreed with Ford's testimony to some degree, and 35 percent said they agreed with Kavanaugh's testimony to some degree.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied in his testimony, and 30 percent said the same about Ford's testimony.
Following the Flake investigation, the FIBI is currently investigating the allegation made by Ford and another alleged suspect, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee when he swore last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him while drunk on his 17th birthday.
Ramirez also said that Supreme Court nominees showed him secret photos at a party while he was a student at Yale in the early 1980's.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet that can be shared with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is developing a new technology that could rival the likes of Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The new invention of this technologist, called Inrupt, was a new company based on the Berners-Lee invention called Solid.
Solid's privacy policy allows users to choose where their data should be stored and who should see it and when.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the main objective of Inrupt is to "take over the world".
"We have to do this now", he said of the missionary.
"It is a moment that will be remembered for generations to come".
The tool uses Solid server technology to allow users to create a "permanent online archive" or create a POD.
You will find the order of things, the workload, the timetable, the songs to be sung, and other tools that are needed along with the work.
The tool is designed so that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify can be accessed on the same page at the same time.
The difference with the news stores in this tool is that it is up to the user to choose the news that he can show and to whom he can show it.
The company calls the tool "power each person through my story".
Inrupt's design, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to bring the company's core business, services and expertise to the open source Solid platform.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, former IBM employees, contractors, and other volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own tools using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google to create a new revolution that would change their entire business in a flash.
"We do not ask for permission".
In a Medium post on Saturday night, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of the Inrupt platform is to provide a business and service platform that helps protect the integrity and profitability of the new Solid network".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the world of technology when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has spoken out loud about the issue of internet fairness.
After Inrupt was dissolved, Berners-Lee continued to serve as the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I have great hope for this new era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The chaplain of the WW1 Victoria Cross is honoured
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during World War I was buried in the same town as the man who was buried there a century ago.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and then on Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was unknown to have won the highest military honor in Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a ceremony held in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "a good sign" that the stone should be unveiled 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on the night of September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his squadron into the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the deadly fog of heavy gunfire".
Then he marched across the front line "with great boldness" as he led the advance guard and fired a single shot, killing three soldiers.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German soldier on October 4, 1918 - less than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "things I could never do but that were very good.
She and her brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid flowers after the ceremony, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says that he "felt very honored to be a part of this celebration" and adds that "the glory of a person who has done a great thing is reflected in the support of a great number of people".
MMA fans wait all night to play Bellator 206, but Peppa Pid is shown
Imagine that you are staying up all night to play a game of Bellator 206 but are denied access to the game.
The San Jose announcement included 13 matches, including six on the card, and was broadcast throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to get married, UK viewers were surprised when the broadcast was changed to a Peppa Pig performance.
Some people felt uncomfortable after staying up late into the night.
One Twitter user described the change in policy and the inclusion of youth sports as "bad entertainment".
"There is a federal policy that says that the programming is not appropriate to air at 6 a.m"., said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's chief spokesman for advertising and communications, when asked about the incident.
"Please, the pigs", yes.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said that the show would be re-scheduled to include U.K. viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about a rerun, I hope we can do that", Coker said.
"It is now six o'clock on Sunday and we can't do anything until Sunday for us, which is Monday for them.
But we are working on it.
For I am not worthy of the gospel the apostles did before me preach.
We fought to fix it, thinking that something was wrong.
But it was not, and the matter was with the government.
I promise that this will never happen again.
Now we are going to show five boxing matches in the sixth season - as we always do - we wanted to make sure we had a good audience but we were over-subscribed.
It was a tragedy".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'unemployed' because of his designs
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley said that he grew up feeling unemployed because of his sexual orientation - but that it gave him the motivation to do something about it.
The 24-year-old did not realize until he went to high school that "other people are not crazy".
In her first radio broadcast on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she was speaking about gay rights to give them "hope".
He also said that being a royal helped him to reduce his anxiety about winning the Olympics.
The longtime moderator, Kirsty Young, has been on sick leave for a month.
Appearing as a jobless man in Laverne's first episode, Daley said he felt "slightly less than" everyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to be gay".
"To this day", he said, "these feelings of inferiority, of being special, are some of the things that give me the most power and the most energy in the world".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so that he would not embarrass others when they learned something about his creations.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for other countries to lift bans on gay marriage.
He said this because he felt free from oppression and wanted others to share his "hope".
The three-time world champion said that she had a relationship with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "who had a special connection with me".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior that year but said the age gap did not bother him.
"If you've been through something as hard as this in your childhood" - he went to the Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone in his generation who had been through the same things, good and bad.
The two became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his eyes" were on the baby.
"If you had asked me this last year, my answer would have been that I want to win the gold medal", he said.
"You know, there are other things that are bigger than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is now Robbie".
His son bears the name of his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said her father was not sure she was going to die and that the question was why he had to ask for tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that you'd have to meet my father to get the front seats", he said.
"I held their hand until they lost their breath and only when they lost their breath and died did I realize that they too could be defeated", he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to be in front of a crowd in my hometown at the Olympic Games, and there was nothing better", she said.
So she chose the theme song - Proud by Heather Small - which she had been singing every time she was preparing for the Olympics and which had made her feel less anxious.
The Desert Island Discs programme is broadcast regularly on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was suspended for a poor performance in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson will make a name for himself on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to work hard to keep his record from being broken.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th double-elimination, is paired with his manager Jim Furyk for Saturday's 4th and 4th games.
In his mid-game show, as he usually does when he travels to the United States, the nine-time champion divides his day between being a celebrity and working on his team to solve the problems that plague him.
A 48 - year - old student who has never been a professional golfer, even at the height of his game, would not be able to compete at Le Golf National, where the length of the course is often a challenge to the speed of the balls that come off the course.
And if the length of the field itself isn't a problem, Mickelson, in his ninth match on Sunday, will have to contend with British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed with top-ranked Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who have four shots in their opening 12 one-on-one games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game will be a little more difficult.
Furyk's confidence in this man is unquestionable.
"He knows exactly what he has to do today, he gives me a little hug and says he'll be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has faith in himself.
He is one of the many players inducted into the Hall of Famer and has done a lot to add to these teams in the past, and this week.
I never thought that he would do it twice.
We did not jump to conclusions, but we did not settle down to the extent that we were able to.
She wanted to be there, as I wanted everyone to be there".
Mickelson will beat Faldo for the most points in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It would be the end of his Ryder Cup career that would never match the size of his body.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and one draw, although Furyk said his presence had brought about a positive change in the team.
"He's funny, he's tough, he's got a great sense of humor, he likes to tell people funny stories, and he's the nicest guy in the room", she explained.
"I hope the young players are enjoying themselves, as am I this week, which was a lot of fun.
She has more than she has given".
European Commissioner Thomas Bjorn sees his famous leadership in danger of being lost forever
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that his famous lead into the final days of the Ryder Cup singles would be a quick turnaround.
The Danish star made his first appearance in the 1997 tournament at Valderrama, where the captain of the side Seve Ballesteros beat the Americans by 5 runs but eventually finished just short of equalling by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remember how we were the first at Valderrama; we were the first at Brookline, where we lost, and then Valderrama, where we won", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and the previous day's 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Thus, the events that follow indicate that the story is not over.
Tomorrow is full of energy.
Go and do whatever you can.
This is a case that will not be solved until the necessary steps are taken.
We do not run a race without a goal in mind. We do not run the race to be crowned by a champion.
As I always say, my attention is on the 12 coaches on our side, but we know very well who is on the other side - the most powerful coaches in the world".
Appreciating the way his team had performed in the heat, Bjorn added: "I couldn't have done it without preparation.
Tomorrow is the day to meet the beast.
Tomorrow will be a long time coming, and this is a special event.
It's good when you have a friend and things are going well, but when you're on your own, you're tested to the limit like a golfer.
This is the message you should give to the teachers, that you should reach all the good that you will be doing tomorrow.
But you have left your fellow worker behind, who has worked hard for him, just as you have".
Like Bjorn, the other number one Jim Furyk will be looking for more players on the field than he would have if he were in the squad, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have three goals each.
Furyk himself was also involved in this turning point, when he was part of the winning team at Brookline before the Europeans staged the "Miracle on the Medinah".
"I remember every word that was said about it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, led his team to the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to go to the first one like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When such power is limited to one side, it is more likely to be suppressed by the center of the athlete.
Let us arrange the players according to the order and place the boys in such a way that we see fit, you know, to try to make a miracle tomorrow night".
Thomas is tasked with leading the relay and will face Rory McIlroy in the top round, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter of Europe on the other side of the field.
"I joined a club like this because I thought it would work all the way through", said Bjorn about his choice of team.
The German navy was again deployed
The new German Navy ship was supposed to enter service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era ships, but was delayed until this year due to a lack of equipment and rising costs.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class, has now been postponed until early 2019, according to a military spokesman quoted by Die Zeit.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but transport problems prevented its completion.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships acquired by the Navy in 2007 were intended to replace the aging Bremen-class ships.
It is reported to have a wide range of wireless, wireless navigation and navigation systems as well as other technological devices, such as remote sensing, infrared and navigation systems.
Other important features of these ships are their long service life - they can be extended to two years from shore.
However, the delayed process means that the modern ships expected to protect Germany at sea will be underpowered by the time they are commissioned, reports Die Zeit.
The seemingly unviable F125 was on the news all year, when the Navy refused to unload the ship and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to its owners after receiving a commission.
The reasons for the refusal were not immediately clear, but German radio reports indicated "software and hardware problems" that could affect the ship if it were to be put into a defensive role.
The problems of the gun were compounded by the fact that the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be manned by 120 men - half the number of the older Bremen class.
Furthermore, it was found that the ship was too heavy to be of much use and that the Army's additional equipment would be limited.
The 7,000 - ton "Rheinland - Pfalz" is believed to have been twice the weight of similar German ships in World War II.
In addition to some difficult equipment, the cost of the whole project - including the training of the pilots - was a major problem.
The price was estimated to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - down from the original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems encountered in the new ships were so acute in the face of modernity that the number of mercenaries on German waters was dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German defense department, said that the Navy "has no more ships to send to the defense".
He noted that the problem is increasing over time, as older ships are being scrapped without being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were being commissioned into the Navy.
The National Trust has a list of hundreds of such sites.
A study in the Scottish Highlands is investigating the ways in which the geese use the land and the environment to find food.
It is hoped that the new findings will help to shed new light on the nature of these flying creatures and help guide future environmental policies.
This scientific study by the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common species of piper and soprano pipistrelle as well as the long-eared piper and Daubenton piper at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Sound recorders will be placed in the surrounding area to monitor the movements of the earth at all times.
NHS staff and volunteers will conduct the tests using the equipment provided.
Red-shift monitoring is performed on all shifts when there are no dark lines and the dark bands are not active.
The map and the map map map are then used to create a large image of the landscape and the characteristics of the mountains.
Rob Dewar, a conservationist at the NTS, hopes that the findings will reveal which areas are more vulnerable to volcanism and how these areas are used for each type of volcano.
This information will help to understand the importance of conserving wetlands and the need to conserve the forest habitat of mountains and other natural features.
The number of black people in Scotland and the UK has decreased over the last century.
It is threatened by the destruction of its habitat by commercial and industrial activities.
Electric machines that generate electricity by steam and electricity are also dangerous, as are the leaves of the hunting tree and some of the trees used for the preparation of wares, as well as the bite of the witch.
The fields are not long.
However, because of its highly specialized nature, its ears are used more than its eyes when it is chewing food.
It uses a unique acoustic system that detects the presence of insects and other pests along its path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of 270 historic buildings, 38 luxury gardens and 76,000 hectares of wildlife around the country is particularly concerned about the forest.
The agency has ten volunteers, who perform search, rescue and rescue missions.
The Society has established Scotland's first and only national wildlife sanctuary on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of wildlife found in Scotland.
The park's director, David Thompson, says that the small area is ideal for the tiger.
"Here at Threave we have a large piece of land", they said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a beautiful bird sanctuary.
But there are other unknown geological features, and our work in this area will help us to understand them better".
The danger of monitoring the mountains before the work on the wetlands is done is explained, since the destruction of one nesting site could kill up to 400 adult and juvenile birds, which would destroy the entire population of the site.
Farms are protected and it is illegal to kill, maim, or destroy their natural habitat
Elisabeth Ferrell, director of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encourages the public to get involved.
"There is much to learn about our environment", he said, "because we have not yet learned how to live with many of the species that we have".
Ronaldo denies the rape allegation during a hearing to prepare for the German magazine trial
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charge of rape was "false", and that "some people wanted to discredit themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers were preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which had published the controversial article.
The Portuguese footballer with Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly offered her a $375,000 bribe to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In his Instagram video message to 142 million followers after the alleged story, Ronaldo, 33, denied the allegation and called it "a lie".
"No, no, no, no. It was a mistake.
What they say today, it's a lie", said the five - time Ballon d'Or winner, looking into the camera.
"They wanted to call it by my name.
It happens.
They wanted to be recognized by my name, but not by theirs.
I am a happy man and everything is going well", he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are planning to sue Der Spiegel over what they call "unverified reports", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the prosecution would seek damages for the "violation of privacy in a series of unlawful violations, which is the most serious violation of human rights in recent years".
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a bar, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the victim's room, where she allegedly raped him from behind, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the incident and was "99 percent" a "normal" person, "just 1 percent"
The papers stated that Ronaldo had admitted to the affair but that it was consensual.
Mayorga said she had called the police to obtain a photocopy of the hospital, but later agreed to settle the case out of court because of "fear of reprisals" and "fear of public embarrassment".
The 34-year-old woman said that she now wanted to bring the case back because she had been emotionally traumatized by what had happened.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, having previously been signed by Italian club Juve for a fee of around €100 million.
Brexit: UK 's 'forever laugh' at car manufacturers
The UK will 'have a good laugh' if it loses its position as a car manufacturer after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would stop production at its Burnaston site, near Derby.
"We need to make a deal", Clark said.
Japanese automakers have warned that the potential for delays in reopening borders due to Brexit negotiations could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 vehicles this year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of October we will see a halt to production in our region", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have also expressed concerns about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and how cross-border trade will be affected, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would lease the Mini site in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
A growing concern for the car industry is the lack of Brexit negotiations.
Toyota's production is "time-dependent", with production materials arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers within the UK and EU that have already produced cars for customers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 October, there could be a border dispute that could cause delays and a shortage of supplies.
It would be very difficult for Toyota to stay in the Derbyshire area for a day without a plant, the company said, which would cause the plants to shut down.
Clark said that Theresa May's plans for future relations with the EU "are well designed to avoid these border issues".
"We need a consensus. We need to have a good dialogue and consensus that allows us to not only have the development that I said we have now but to have that opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to continue to develop a common framework that helps us in our business".
Toyota did not say how long it would take to restart operations, but over time, it has warned that rising costs could reduce the competitiveness of its plants and cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chief executive of the local union, says his members are very concerned: "From what I have seen, these jobs are rarely seen as being unemployable".
A government spokesman said: "We have prepared a very good and comprehensive framework for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "extended for another week" as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Russian election fraud, Trump's ties to Russian allies and the judicial oversight of the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, which could threaten Mueller's immunity, has been a topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was planning to take a tape recorder with him to Trump and see it as a way to remove the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
But on the Monday before that, he had been to the White House, where a notice of his resignation had been circulated.
In the meantime, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was postponed to Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed in the run-up to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of his alleged sexual assault accusers, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both acquitted.
On Friday, Trump announced a week-long FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case, which was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate.
Trump's correspondent, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein hearing, he said: "The date is not fixed, either this week or that week because of the situation in the supreme court.
But we will talk then and I always like to inform the media about what is going on".
Some media may disagree with this statement: Sanders has not had a media interview at the White House since September 10.
The program's host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of media coverage would not make the broadcaster "visible", though he said: "I don't deny the fact that they are visible".
He also said that Trump's talks with the leaders would increase.
"Our leaders prefer Q&A sessions to all the previous ones", they said, adding without giving a date: "We have discussed those numbers".
The conversation continued, Sanders said, but "if the media had questions for the president of the United States, that would be better than talking to me.
We've tried that many times and you've seen how we did it last week and what happens when you talk to the president of the United States".
Trump is often asked questions as he leaves the White House, during a question and answer session or during a press conference with guests.
Talking directly to politicians is not easy.
In New York City this week, the authorities demonstrated a provocative, sometimes spontaneous, and sometimes sudden display of gang violence.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to the EU staff working on the NHS in Scotland to thank them for their continued work on the NHS post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made arrangements to reimburse all costs of the consultations of EU citizens working in their area.
In her letter Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU's permanent representative continued, leading to a final agreement by the autumn of this year.
But the UK Government has already begun preparations for a possible negotiation.
I know that this is a difficult time for you.
I am not going to say this in a way that will encourage you to think differently.
You, my fellow colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring a wealth of knowledge to the strengthening and improvement of the health sector, and to the benefit of our fellow patients.
Scotland is your home and we long for you to be here".
Christion Abercrombie Survives After a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers coach Christion Abercrombie was injured in the shoulder after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's game, which was lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime practice.
"He took the wrong side and shot himself", said Reed.
The health coach gave Abercrombie a breathing gas immediately and took him for a closer examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released under investigation from Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was "no evidence of the nature or extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year football coach at the school, was in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five Saturdays before his release, bringing his team's total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying goods in the UK
Foreign buyers will be taxed heavily when they buy goods in the UK and additional income will be generated to help the homeless meet the Tory agenda.
This action will end the power of Corbyn to attract young voters.
This paper tax will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Fund expects to raise up to £120 a year for the homeless
Foreign buyers will face higher taxes on goods bought in the UK - and additional costs to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This action will be seen as an attempt to undermine the power of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to recruit young voters who promise affordable housing and fair pay for the rich.
This paper tax will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK, with additional funds to help the Government work towards reducing the burden of tax evasion.
This tax - which is an additional tax on the old tax, plus a top-up added two years ago on second homes and rents - could be as high as 3 percent.
The Fund expects to generate a profit of up to £120 million a year.
Up to 13 percent of London's properties are bought by non-UK residents, making it difficult for potential UK residents to become homeowners.
Many of the world's major cities have become "squat towns" because of the housing demands of foreigners who spend long periods of time abroad.
The new legislation comes just three weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy homes.
He argued that developers were driving up house prices by owning land but not using it, and called on May to "to see to it that the price of houses is reduced so that the stigma of overcrowding in Britain is reduced".
Corbyn delivered a positive speech on the plans for social reform, including tax reform and the end of "errorless" evictions.
He also promised to give the local authorities the authority to build new houses.
"This year", said May, "I have announced my resignation from the presidency to restore the British dream - a better Britain for a whole new generation.
This means repairing the messy parts of our homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and enjoy life there.
However, it is not clear that it would be easy for non-UK residents, as well as foreign companies, to do the same for British nationals.
For many, the dream of owning a home is a distant dream, and the need for a place to live is growing".
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that his "greatest ambition" would be to manage Scotland for a season.
The 42-year-old Scottish international is looking forward to the challenge of taking the North - East club, third in League One, three points clear.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Mirren to promotion back to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
"My dream was to play for my country.
I had a B - cell, which was just there", Ross told BBC Sportsound Scotland.
"But I grew up playing for Scotland at Hampden a lot with my father, and that's one thing that brings me back.
However, the opportunity may come if I can be effective in leading the congregation".
The Sunderland managers who have been in charge since Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he was not afraid to go after big names in the Premier League, after he had turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My performance this season will be measured by the question Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'
"The architecture of the club is such that the club is a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not easy to get this group there, but I'll be proud if I can get it there".
Ross completed three years in the role, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as manager of Hearts.
He also helped Alloa to a 3rd place finish, and saved St Mirren from near collapse to win the Championship the following season.
And Ross said that he felt better about himself now than he had ever felt when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was time to build a strong foundation", he recalled, when he started to form the band Alloa.
"I know that I am more of a manager than a footballer.
It sounds strange because I've done a good job, I've built a nice home, I'm comfortable on the top.
But playing is not always easy.
There are certain things you have to go through every week.
I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the job, but the direction is clear.
I always wanted to be a leader and now I am, and that sounds like the best thing I've ever heard in my adult life".

The best time to drink a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., says a study
The heat of summer has helped Britain's crops to survive longer than the buildings they are in.
The tobacco trade was up 2.7 percent in July - but the situation was not as bad in the metropolitan area, where the trade fell 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business association, summed up the figures: "The strong and continuing participation rate in the World Cup in England means that July followed the pattern of the previous June, when prices rose by 2.8%, except for the fact that the building sector was in decline.
The decline in the food industry of 1.8 percent in June was compounded in July.
All the beverage outlets have done very well in emulating the restaurant scene.
We have also reduced the number of stores that sell food, but not to the extent that we are able to return to the number of food stores that are in full swing.
It seems that people are just trying to get drunk.
The beer industry saw a 6.6 percent increase in sales this month, while the food industry saw a 3 percent decline".
Paul Newman, of the RSM research institute on rainfall and human development, says: "The rainfall shows the same pattern that is seen from late June.
weather and events due to sports and mass gatherings contributed greatly to the boom in the housing market.
It came as a surprise that the industrial sector was still in recession, although the decline in the figure to 4.8 percent from a year earlier would have been a serious addition to the already low inflation.
The continuation of the summer heat is unlikely to be as strong as this for the food industry and it is only a matter of time before the cooler weather we have in July will make the business more profitable".
Sales growth in the food and beverage sector, including new business, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new product launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks the UK's dairy and food industries, compiles market research from 47 organisations, with a combined value of £9 billion, and is the industry leader in this field.
One in five children has a fraud account that is kept secret from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have had a conversation with their parents or teachers about a topic that is not of interest to them, the survey revealed.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a surge in "fake instagram" accounts
This article raises concerns that content posted on these pages may be obscene
20 percent of the students said they had a large account that they could show to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have a checking account that is kept as a secret from an adult.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a surge in "fake instagrams" - a reference to the popular photo-sharing app instagram.
This subject has raised such concerns that some of the material posted on these sites is offensive.
20 percent of students said they use a large private account that they can show to their parents, and they have a number of private accounts.
A parent who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found that she was forcing her friends to "forcibly have sex with her".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18 year olds had two profiles, and half of those children reported having a hidden account.
"It's very sad that teenagers are being tempted to create websites that their parents and teachers can't see", said Mike Buchanan, the executive director of HMC.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the executive committee of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most decorated athletes in track and field and coach Ian Beattie described the role as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to benefit from the great experience that she will be gaining globally over the next decade.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in Scottish, UK and international sport by the racing community and we hope that Scottish sport will benefit from bringing him to the governing body", said Beattie.
"I am ready to be the voice of the sport of athletics and hope to contribute to its development and to the development of the sport in Scotland", Doyle said.
The American sprinter, who won Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is a BBC news commentator, was paralyzed after suffering a stroke.
"Today marks a month since I had my stroke", he wrote on Twitter.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that it would only take time to heal and then I would be better.
It was a struggle, but I was cured, learned to walk again, and now I am able to take care of my body.
Thank you for your kind words of encouragement!"
The marketing of the milk-based formula to compare mothers to cows has created a controversy online
A dairy company has sparked a wave of online advertising that has compared women to dairy cows.
In the lead up to what has been billed as "the world's first milkshake", the technology company Elvie has developed a special video advertisement that celebrates the freedom that milkshake gives to breastfeeding women.
Four drunken sisters sing a song in the cow's feed that includes the words: "Yes, I'm a milkman, but you can't see the tail" and "if you don't look at this, it's not cow's milk, it's human milk".
The song continues: "Blow, blow, blow, I will feed the children, blow, blow, I will lie down my maidens".
However, this commercial, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reviews, with many saying it downplayed the negative aspects of the dairy industry.
"It is a terrible thing to use a bull to advertise this device.
Someone wrote that, just as we are, they are pregnant and giving birth, only to have their babies born within a few days of birth.
The milk-capsules of Elvie are perfectly preserved in the milk of the nursing mother
Another said: "It seems to be a mixed bag for both mother and child.
But why not use it to promote a formula that is a mother's milk for her children?"
Another added: "It's a form of propaganda".
Others also supported the ad, with one woman saying the song "sounds good".
"I think this is a good job.
I could have gotten one myself if I had been a milkman.
The milk made me feel like a cow.
This distribution is more complicated but I have taken the material from there.
This is a gift", wrote one.
Another commented: "The advertising is directed at women who are sucking milk (usually at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'
This is neither a compliment nor a criticism of the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all kissed each other while they were still holding milk in their mouths.
The message in the advertisement is based on the comment of many lactating mothers who feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump, who does not have a tail, no strings or legs, sits inside the bottle, allowing the mothers to walk, hold their babies and go elsewhere while they are breastfeeding.
"Elvie Pump is such a good tool that it requires a lot of practice to get started", says Ana Balarin, a staff member and ECD at Mother.
By imitating the milkmaids and the dairy cows, we wanted to put the milk-fed and the problems of the street in a more positive light, while showing in a humorous and graphic way the richness of freedom that the new job will bring.
This is the first time that the Elvie pump appears in the story.
At the beginning of London Fashion Week, a mother of two was seen wearing the device in a fashion show by Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Seized in the Texas Border Camp
The number of children entering the country illegally has risen despite the border crossings last month staying the same, due to strong policies implemented by the Trump administration to strengthen child support systems.
Similarly, many of the supporters were people who had entered the country without papers, and they feared that they too would be deported if they came out publicly to say that they had helped any child.
The situation became more acute in June, when the authorities ordered that the applicants for support and other senior family members must present their fingerprints and other evidence to the authorities in charge of entry.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency has a record of volunteers who have helped immigrant children who have no parents.
The report noted that 70 percent of those arrested were never convicted of a crime.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either aid workers or members of aid organizations are illegal immigrants, many of them refugees from their home countries.
So let us continue to search for such people", said Albence.
In an effort to resolve the issue of children as quickly as possible, the authorities introduced a law requiring that some of them appear in court within one month of their arrest, rather than within 60 days, which was the usual time frame, according to the camp officials.
Many will be seen through video chat, as they will be held accountable for their crimes against the criminal justice system.
Those who are found unfit will be readmitted immediately.
The children's involvement in the camps will cause them emotional distress and emotional distress, which can lead to violence and attempts to escape, which is consistent with the statements of the camp's staff and the threats brought to the camp in recent months.
Child advocates said that this anxiety is heightened in a large area such as Tornillo, where symptoms of child abuse are often ignored, due to the size of the area.
She added that bringing children to the tent city without giving them the proper time to prepare and make friends could exacerbate the abuse they already suffered.
Syria has ordered troops from the US, France and Turkey to leave their territory immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return to their country even as the war has entered its eighth year.
Mr. Moualem, who is currently serving as Prime Minister, said that any foreign military presence in his country without authorization would be charged with terrorism, and would be subject to disciplinary action".
"They must leave immediately and without any further delay", the council was told.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is coming to an end" in Syria, where some 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and many more have been displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight this holy war until we have removed from the territory of Syria" all the groups that had been expelled and "all those who had been brought in from abroad".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops to Syria, providing training and advice to Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces opposed to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed some 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the country was safe enough for them to return and complained about "some eastern countries" for "spreading fear among the people" that made refugees afraid to return home.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate the return of the people", they said.
"They are mixing political language with a purely utilitarian subject".
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive any reconstruction assistance until a peace agreement is reached between Assad and his opponents to end the war.
The UN envoy said that the agreement between Russia and Turkey that facilitated the creation of a demilitarized zone in the heavily fortified Idlib region offers hope for further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish negotiations prevented a Russian - backed Syrian invasion of the province, which has a population of about 1 million.
But Moualem said the agreement had "definite deadlines" and expressed hope that military action against jihadists, including the Nusra Front of Al-Qaeda, would be "never brought to an end".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that a new committee will be convened by the members of the intergovernmental body to draft a bill that will be effective after the end of the war in Syria and allow for elections.
Moualem cited the Syrian government's requests to be included in the committee, saying the organization's activities "are subject to the provisions of the existing charter", and warned against any comparison with these activities.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
Following this election, Trump could win re-election in 2020 or, as many liberals hope, be removed by force and impeached by the Senate to end his presidency.
In what seemed to be "the most difficult issue of the last days of human rule!"
At present, there are no signs of the end of the world.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has 2.4 million viewers on prime time from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surged to an average of 3.5 million viewers per day on the nightly newscast.
"This is a fire that people are getting into because of something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, writer and performer of the comedy "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Facts About Getting Into the Boy Scouts of Hollyhood", has another story.
She recalled her first bus ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver of the car told her that he would vote for Trump.
What will it be? he asked.
"Because they make me laugh", Mother Scovell told me.
There are many interesting things in the Bible.
In fact, unlike other TV shows, news headlines from Washington state could be critical to the outcome of Roe v. Wade, if families who have immigrated can be reunited and the global financial system.
This program is one of the best that the lucky number of people can afford to watch
However, it was more than a little bit of a national experience when you found yourself on the sixth episode of the panel discussing the use of the "mysterious" search for Bob Woodward's "Fear", a $15,000 leather jacket for Paul Manafort ("the proud, self-assured coat", according to the Washington Post) and a famous description of Stormy Daniels's Trump strategy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what makes it seem like a real show is that it's a daily show", said Brent Montgomery, the host of the show Trump and the daily comedy (contrary to N.F.L., opposing Kim Jong-un).
If you can't afford to take a day off, you'll never be able to get out of it.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was midday and 80 degrees outside his home on the southern side of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He failed to even briefly, not when Brett Kavanaugh was scheduled to meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's decision seemed to be on the line.
"I remember when we were doing these programs back in the day and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of the Middle East,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true".
Amy Chozick, a Times business, political and media columnist, is writing a timeline called "Chasing Hillary".
Foreign currency is flooded in the Houses in the midst of a heated debate.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is the most expensive in this category, due to the congressional redistricting of two candidates for the same seat.
The newly renovated district of the city of Pittsburgh is contested by Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a different city in a special election the previous year.
Lamb was running against the incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which borders the 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old townships had been illegally confused in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the 17th district is focused on the campaign finance race between the two largest party funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a highly contested special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the state by 20 points.
The media has given the Democrats a lot of power and influence.
U.S. to Stop Punishing El Salvador for Its Support to China, and to Stop Rejecting It
The Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing's authority, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a successful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until his colleagues sacked the Trump administration.
The National Security Council decided to remove the US ambassadors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the last vestiges of hostility to Taiwan's leadership", said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the council, in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were focused on El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including a boost in drug trafficking, development and trade assistance.
The sanctions, which include cuts to aid and travel bans, are particularly severe in the Central American country where unemployment is high and the violence is rife.
In the midst of the talks, the heads of state of North and Central America have postponed a meeting on security and economic cooperation, following a similar meeting last year that was seen as a new step in an effort to keep immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid - September, the officials of the organization announced that they wanted to hold the convention, thus making it possible for the whole country to be represented.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently preparing to speak at the meeting, which is being held in mid-summer, in the lobby of the transportation department at the meeting, delegates said.
Three American envoys also quietly left El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any fresh news or sanctions from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the talks presented by three senior US diplomats, including two who agreed to discuss the details of the talks on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were verified by a source close to the administration who also stated that he would not reveal the names.
Learn From the Past
Another story that follows is the allegations by prosecutor Robert Mueller in the Trump administration's attempted judicial corruption, which is supported by a number of documents.
Mueller was reported to have changed his investigation's view if Trump's alleged involvement in the election was linked to Russia's attack on our election.
If Congress changes its policy, Trump will find himself guilty of that crime, and will be prepared to run for re-election, or perhaps stand as an independent.
The uncertainty is high, and I don't think that Trump's downfall will happen - or even the Europeans.
There are benefits to all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that could affect the progress of the war.
In 1938, the German chancellor prepared to try to overthrow the dictator, Hitler, at Munich, with the help of the Eastern Allies and the Czechoslovakians.
We failed, we lost the chance to stop the next wave of deaths.
The history of the past revolves around this change, and the history of free speech is unchanged and unchallenged.
Americans are now living through these turbulent times.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is leading the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a lot of trouble since the document was announced, this year, saying he would begin secretly recording presidential conversations and would speak out against the president's being in office.
Rosenstein said that the Times' report was untrue.
"What if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. involving Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court or if there is a suspicion of rape and sexual misconduct?
And most importantly, will we vote in a midterm election for Congress that will hold Trump accountable for his actions?
If we fail in our attempt, the rights of the individual will be in jeopardy for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the education I received in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish immigrant from Czechoslovakia who had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy.
They survived, emigrated to America and, after sixty years, sent me to light the Sabbath candle on a table with the swastika cross.
After going through this ordeal, how can I not have hope for our cause?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is hopeful of a future against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that defeating the Austrians, followed by a hard-fought Spanish defeat to Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to eliminate them from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing in the first game of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he hoped the Rangers could use his experience as a back-up.
"It was a good time for us because Villarreal are a strong team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered this game thinking we would get something, but we actually got one.
If we are to be numbered, we are to be numbered.
They did well in the first place, and we did well in the second.
As we leave on Thursday, it will be another day with them in Europe.
Hopefully, we can take three tons but it will be a strong game because they had good tons in the game that they played today, with a lot of fans, I hope we will win very well.
The past year was difficult, with all the things that happened to me and the changes in our team, but this year the team looks good.
The crowd is beautiful and the young men are well-groomed; the dancing is pleasant.
Hopefully, we can move forward now, putting the game behind us and winning".
Women are losing sleep over the fear of the aftermath of retirement
Although the participants had a reasonable expectation of what they would like to be treated for, few spoke to their relatives about the matter.
Up to one third of those polled in a global survey said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said that they talk to their children about the matter.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't want to talk about it", said Holly Snyder, the deputy chief executive of the National Insurance Company.
That is the beginning.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to be self - sufficient if they do not know your needs ahead of time.
Be devoted to them in like manner, and be ready to lend to them as much as is necessary. For this is profitable and brings good results.
Include your financial advisors: Your advisors help you find ways to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care insurance policy may be covered by a popular type of long-term care insurance, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy that helps you pay for it or pay for it yourself with your own money - if you have the money.
Work on your paperwork: Finish the legal battle as soon as possible.
Keep a record of your medical history so that you can appoint a trusted health care professional to monitor your health and to make sure that your health is not compromised if you are unable to speak.
Also, think about who is in charge of your finances.
You can appoint a trusted financial adviser to handle the financial affairs and to make sure that all your debts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Don't forget to include all the necessary information: Imagine that your elderly parents are in critical condition and are being transported to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about their medical and health-related issues?
Place the points in the right order so that you are ready.
"It's not about who has the money, but who is responsible?" asked Martin.

A man is shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot several times when he was walking home from a nightclub.
The man, in his 40s, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, after he had been stabbed in the chest, stomach and throat.
Police described the attack, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act"
The man did not see the one who had struck him.
His injuries were not serious, and the police have called for any witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Palu on Friday, which has been described as the worst in the country, with the death toll expected to rise.
At the time of the disaster, the relief workers were unable to receive regular communications from Donggala, the area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, as many as 16,000 people were displaced during the disaster.
Here are some facts about the Palu and Donggala areas, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the western tip of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary of independence when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a 300 - km (180 miles) - long coastal area on the east coast of Sulawesi.
The district, which is home to the provincial administration offices, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala area.
Nickel mining is also common in the province, but it is most abundant in the Morowali region, on the other side of Sulawesi.
The cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, floods killed 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The same wave also hit the Donggala Peninsula in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is a frequent recipient of earthquakes.
The following is a list of the most powerful earthquakes and waves in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake off the coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunami waves that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, with most of the deaths in the Aceh area.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late October and early September.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the southern coast of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered tidal waves along the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A quake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale rocked the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
Some 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck the island of Mentawai near Sumatra, sending waves up to 10 meters (33 feet) high, devastating villages and killing 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing devastation and concern as people remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No waves were recorded at that time, but over 100 people died as a result of the collapse.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Lombok, the most popular tourist destination in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many buildings and left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with violence and oppression
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for a violent crime
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of assault, in connection with a rape case and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to police sources, when the girl who had seen her tried to call the police, Palin took the phone away from her.
Palin is currently being held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 non-parole bond, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty, and was acquitted when questioned about the case, the broadcaster said.
Palin has three Class A misdemeanours, which means that she could face up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
I was also charged with a Class B misdemeanour, which carries a day in jail and a fine of up to $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, she allegedly stabbed her father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, sent the police to the scene.
The case is now before the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was convicted of assault, conspiracy to commit assault, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said that he had hit her in the face with a club.
Sarah Palin was heavily criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after linking her son's violence to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
A total of 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake produced tidal waves that destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electrical wires and connections have been destroyed and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just off the coast of central Sulawesi, east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos that were distributed on the Internet showed the extent of the destruction.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the river's edge in the city of Palu when the waves hit the island.
The prosecutor in the court was demanding the death penalty for the suspected NYC attacker
The New York City prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, accused of the New York City bombing that killed eight people -- the most unprecedented trial in the country for a crime that has gripped the nation since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot truck to cause the accident on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists in the summer months.
To carry out the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight people "on the spot" and injured people "on the spot", according to a notice seeking the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both cases carry the death penalty, according to the court's ruling.
A few weeks after the accident, a jury found Saipov guilty of 22 charges, including eight counts of murder with the aid of a dangerous weapon, which is often used by state prosecutors in criminal cases, and one count of car wrecking.
The attack required "precision and planning", said the government's prosecutor, describing Saipov's actions as "cruel, callous and unconcerned".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused the injury, pain, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the notice said.
Five of the passengers were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York last handed down the death penalty.
The defendant at the time, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering the drug dealers but his sentence was commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was handed down in a New York state trial was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a husband and wife who had been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was very sorry for what he had done, which he told the police.
Saipov told prosecutors that he was motivated to commit the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to court documents.
He also asked to have an ISIS flag displayed in his hospital room, police said.
The man denied all 22 charges on the indictment.
David Patton, one of the lawyers representing Saipov, said that he was "very disappointed" by the verdict.
"We think that the preference for the death penalty over a plea of guilty and a life sentence will only add to the suffering of all involved", said Paton.
Saipov's lawyers initially asked the prosecutors to rule against the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be given the job of Brexit negotiator
Nigel Farage has promised to 'gather a crowd' at the Tory meeting.
A former Ukip leader said politicians 'must be angry' at Eurosceptics - as one of their MPs, Theresa May, has refused to take the lead in the EU summit.
The Conservative leader Peter Bone made the following statement in Birmingham that the UK 'would have left by now' if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to bring together her divided party is growing as pro-Remain Tories join a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
This great leader is being forced to keep his Presidency in check amid attacks from Brexit supporters, the Left and the EU.
His allies said they would continue to press for talks with Brussels even if there were a break - forcing both Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their own positions and the 'other'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to 'get out of the Chequers' story.
They said that Mr. Farage would be appointed as a delegate and would be given the task of negotiating with Brussels.
'Those who have been in the business before, now we are out of it,' they said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I am against Brexit but we must get out of the Chequers scheme.'
In his rejection of the EU, he said: 'We did not fight a world war to be crushed.
We want to make our own laws as a nation.'
Bone denied claims that public sentiment had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British public mind is free and will live is completely false.'
A Tory Brexit supporter named Andrea Jenkyns was also at the meeting, telling reporters: 'My message is this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers' presence is unknown to most citizens, the opposition will not accept it, it is unknown to our party and the spokesmen who go out in the streets and make us feel uncomfortable in our places.
Please sign up for the Chequers talk and start listening.'
In a statement to May, he said: 'Most Prime Ministers are too busy to keep their promises.'
Farage told the politicians at the meeting that they should feel angry if they want to violate the boundaries set in the 2016 referendum.
'This issue is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and I am a politician,' they said.
'They are trying to stir up a Brexit debate and we are here today to tell you that we will not allow them to do that if they are innocent.'
In a speech to a seemingly friendly crowd, he added: 'I want you to make the politicians, who want to stir up trouble over Brexit, hear the noise.
'We will rally the masses around the world who have given us the Brexit victory and will not rest until we have a free, independent, proud United Kingdom.'
On the other hand, the Survivors also traveled through Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of pro-Brexit protesters held up a banner with the words "Tories Against Brexit" after the rally at the end of last week.
A Labour party official named Adonis was criticising the Conservatives for the vaccine that they had received from the party's official organ after the opening of the convention.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have the best IT services and all the technology of Canada and beyond, for a border free, for a free trade area in Ireland,' he added.
'The chaos is over
There has never been a better Brexit,' he added.
"Mr. Warren was preparing to 'consider' standing for the presidency".
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat made his next announcement during a presidential debate in a building in eastern Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a strong critic of President Donald Trump, was up for re-election in November in a race against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 presidential candidate in Massachusetts.
He is a highly regarded candidate to succeed Trump in 2020.
Saturday's rally in Holyoke was the 36th such meeting with a local community using the hall since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken system, which meant women in the upper echelon, "
The accused was arrested in the case of the death of Sims of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a man has been arrested in connection with the death of LSU basketball player Wayde on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a report at 11 a. m. ET on a live broadcast.
They released a video to promote the Friday, asking people to comment on the character.
Sims, 20, was found dead on the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died from the wound", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde went to protect his friend and was saved by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned about his presence at the scene, armed with a gun, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and held in a tent at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and scored 10 touchdowns in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 yards and 2.9 yards per carry.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is crowned world champion after a group decision that saw him defeat Sebastian Vettel
It was clear by the time Valtteri Bottas won the race ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's decision would play a big part in the race.
From the outset, Bottas made a good start by almost eliminating Hamilton as he secured his place in the second round and invited Vettel to his team's second round.
Vettel stepped aside and let Hamilton go to the end of the line, a fate that should have been a blessing.
Mercedes was leading from behind and had to get behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead after a collision that forced the Ferrari driver out of the middle lane after the second lap to avoid a third stalling.
Max Verstappen started from behind and finished seventh at the end of the one lap on his 21st birthday.
He then continued the long race with his tires on and on to finish ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He then entered the race on lap 44 but was unable to add to his lap 8 finish when Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had a good weekend and the best man to let him pass.
The team has done very well with the 1 and 2", said Hamilton.
What Was a Harmful Speech
President Donald Trump interrupted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday to urge her not to disseminate false documents from Christine Blasey Ford to accuse Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
In his speech to the West Virginia convention, the president made no mention of Ford's appeal to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said that the Senate's record showed that people were "violent and rebellious and false".
"One thing that can happen and something good happens in the Senate in the last few days, is if you look at the voting, you see angry, violent, disrespectful people lying", he said.
"I would look at the story and when they release it, they'd say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
It was not my fault".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you publish the article?
Remember his response...did you take the paper - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not take it out".
Oh, excuse me for a moment.
We have a report", he added, referring to the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing all the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the story was leaked - but Feinstein denied that the leaks were coming from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's suspicions, I did not disseminate his story", Feinsntein told the committee, according to Hill.
They asked me to keep the story secret and I kept it secret as they asked.
But their objection was not well understood by the presidents, who said during the Saturday session: "I know that was a bad expression of the flesh.
Maybe not, but that was the most violent body language I've ever heard".
In a move to defend the Supreme Court nominees, who are accused of sexual assault by three women, the governor said Democrats were using the allegation to their advantage.
They were eager to seize power by any means possible.
See the violence, the corruption, the indifference to the wounded, the arrogance of power and authority", the Medes said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants also won the match
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
Dundee Stars claimed their fifth Elite League victory against Belfast Giants by winning the replay 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly captured two of the boats through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were given comparative scores before Dwyer was forced to lead the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was the leading goal-scorer for Dundee with two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
This was the third Elite League appearance for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing a second when Beauvillier added a lead a minute later.
It was a tight opening day, Sullivan had his home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt made a fair catch to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer confirmed the Giants' lead in the first half when he hit the second ball of the night in the bottom of the ninth.
The crowd was dispersed and Bouchard again entered the match with a strong batting average of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-half lead in the second half and ensure victory for his side in the fifth through the final.
The Giants, who have won four of the five games, play Milton Keynes at home in the next game on Friday.
A Flight Engineer Dies to Ensure the Survival of Thousands in an Earthquake
A heroic Indonesian aviation pioneer died while trying to get a plane carrying hundreds of people safely off the ground.
About 800 people died when a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, and the rest of the people were lost at sea.
The earthquake shook the city so much that many people were still stone-bound.
But even as his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old teacher Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the sweltering fog of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was there to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was en route to the airport, would take off safely.
He jumped from the tower as he saw it collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the flight had saved many lives, reports Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from the hospital in Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the plane arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken", they added.
On the other hand, the government officials feared that the death toll could reach thousands and the worst-affected part of the country is said to be in the Donggala, Sigi and Boutong districts.
"The death toll is expected to rise as many bodies are still in the rock", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Tides of up to six meters [20 feet] were devastating in Palu, where the sun was setting on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft brought relief supplies and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A ambulance is bringing in dead bodies every minute.
No fresh water was available.
A few villages are scattered all over.
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is going to rush out and we don't know what we're going to find.
The risk is serious, but it seems to be growing".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation of people.
Are you ready?" asked CNN.
Indonesia was struck by a powerful earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims a single survivor after a plane crashed into a cliff
The airline company that handled the crash of a plane in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports one missing person, after initially saying that all 47 passengers were rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement Saturday night that he did not know who the man was.
The airline was not cooperating with local residents, hospitals and investigators in their search for the man.
The company could not immediately respond to the complaint because of other factors, such as the person's age and nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the passengers and the pilot after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land on Chuuk Island.
Seven people were taken to hospital, company officials said on Friday.
The company admitted six boys to the hospital on Saturday, and all are in good health.
The cause of the crash and the circumstances surrounding it remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both claimed that the plane crashed into the water while it was trying to land on the runway.
Some eyewitnesses reported that the plane had crashed on a runway.
American aviator Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew very low.
"That was a wonderful experience", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the passengers managed to reach the emergency exit while the plane was still in the air.
He said that the conductors were shouting in confusion, and he said that he had hurt himself a little on the head.
The U.S. Navy said that dock crew members helped to rescue people by using a pump boat to transport them across the river when the ship was in 30 feet (100 m) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people were assisted in PNG plane crashes recorded over the past 20 years.
The researcher says that when the mother was fully awake
The trial on Saturday was abandoned in the trial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department investigator Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the investigation.
He explained to the court how he had used the recorded voice and tried to match the movements of a 29-year-old reporter named Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the day of their death.
Rowlett said she had received location data from a phone call that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of the murder, contrary to her earlier claim, the Clarion Ledger reported.
When evidence showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford came in a stubborn manner and denied being in town that night.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "just lying because my car was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis had known Chambers for two weeks before his death.
Telephone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted all his text messages, his phone numbers, and his phone.
"He was dragging her out of her life", said Hale.
The court is expected to begin deliberations on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to go to trial that very day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Three hip-hop artists wanted to work on a musical that would be more positive and would include a message that would improve people's lives.
High Breed, a group from Bristol, said that hip-hop music has moved away from its more socially provocative and political messages.
The goal was to restore these to their original state and to turn them into solutions to human problems.
Artists such as Fugees and Common have contributed to a revival in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The man who lost another?!
A domestic worker in New York City sued a husband and wife after being fired for "racial slur"
A domestic worker in New York City sued a couple after being fired after receiving a phone call from her mother complaining that she was "a bit of a jerk".
Both men deny the charge of racial discrimination, comparing it to "theft of money".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to discover that her nanny, Giselle Maurice, was a transgender person when she first arrived at work in 2016.
"AWEEEEEEEEEEE A MAN who is a coward", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a telephone message.
But in the process of sending this message to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "unfairly" fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her African-American nanny was too much of a liability and expected to be a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day's work and was fired from Uber.
However, Aunt Maurice sued the family for $350 a day for six months, which was agreed to, even though no contract was signed.
"I want to show them, look, this is not how we do it", he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know this is prejudice".
Both men and women denied the accusations of racism, and that firing Muarice was a good thing, fearing that they would be untrustworthy after the mistake.
"My wife sent me a text message that she should not have said.
They are not partial.
We are not racists", Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"Would you marry your children to someone you have never met or even met?
Your child is a baby?
Think about it".
Comparing the case to a case of "extortion", Plasco's wife had been pregnant for only two months, and she was "not feeling well".
"What kind of man would you be?
This is a good sign", added the treasurer.
During the trial, the audience filled the family with a lot of nonsense, ridiculing them for their conduct and the world's foolishness.
The Paddington publishers feared that their readers would not be convinced of the truth of the matter, a new letter revealed
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who's just read it for the first time before they're accepted.
It is good to know now what we have learned about working well in Paddington".
Her father, who had worked as a BBC photographer before being encouraged to write this children's book that deals with the truth of war, was not happy to find his work disrupted, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "a difficult one" after his death last year.
Referring to Paddington, who was described as "the richest member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of his work.
"He was a humble man, and he never boasted", they added.
"But because Paddington was one of his favorites, it was like having a child who did something good: you're very proud even if you didn't do it.
I hope he saw the Paddington effect in this.
Although it was his own invention, he always refused to bow to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I called her on the phone
There her daughter was taken to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors performed a rescue operation to save her life.
"Nad kept telling me how terrible it was", said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I told him to come.
I did so.
"Thank you, my dear", I said.
I will be with you always.
I will be with you.
The medication that the doctors gave her to slow her heart rate was slowly wearing off and leaving her body.
For the creation was made perfect once for all,
I sat there, waiting to see what would happen.
Surrounded by family and friends, I could not cry or scream.
I just had to encourage her".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan - Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - all of whom had no idea of the plight they were facing.
"Nobody knew", they said.
"I have bowed my head, tears falling down my face.
It's hard to explain, but I was in the air and I felt this compassion for Nad.
To seek my love as well as to praise her.
I knew how much he loved you".
Mourning mothers send cards urging suicide on the bridge
Two women who had lost loved ones to suicide were struggling to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have started putting up cards on the Welsh bridge with friendly words and numbers to call if they need help.
Mother's son, Tyler Davis, suffered from depression and depression when he was 13 years old and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to go through what I'm going through every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, had a son who was a good cook, and a great smile.
"He was known to the people by his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up every room".
However, he did leave the job before he died, as he was in serious trouble".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was found dead in his home.
"I'm always worried that there might be a repeat of the story with her younger sister", said Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis designed the cards "to let people know that they can go and talk to someone, even a friend.
Don't try to be silent - you have to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, also lost her friend Mark, who had been with her for 15 years and had been separated from her mother for a long time.
"He never said he felt anxious or depressed or anything", they said.
"A few days after arriving at the island, we saw his appearance change.
She was so stressed on Christmas Day - when the children were unwrapping their presents that she would not open her eyes to see or to see anything".
She said that her loss was a great loss for them, but that they had to overcome it: "It is a great loss for the family.
It divides us.
But we must continue to fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's motives are in question as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could have something like what he was asking for - timely, measured research - we might have some unity", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "split" in the midst of a difficult party debate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters object to the FBI investigation?
Their hesitation is futile.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, then they will be very disappointed in having their candidate nominated to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush called Senators, asking them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through them had introduced his wife Ashley, former secretary of state to Bush.
What will happen after the FBI releases their lies?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Kavanaugh will receive 50 votes from the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to be confirmed by a vote of no confidence to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's population has "decreased" under Kim
The number of people traveling between North and South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to a South Korean official.
Park Byeong-seug, citing statistics from the South unification ministry, said there were 1,127 foreigners last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the restrictions on the border between North Korea and China and the heavy fines imposed on illegal immigrants if caught could cause the situation to worsen.
Pyongyang is not yet a city.
Many North Koreans are denied their civil rights in South Korea.
Seoul has reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Many escape to China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats these people as illegal immigrants and often deportes them.
Relations between the North and the South - who have been at war for much of the time - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the prospects of nuclear disarmament.
This came after a historic meeting in June with US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they discussed a joint effort to keep the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress in the matter.
"If there is no trust in the U.S. there will be no trust in our national security and there will be no way to develop our own weapons", Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh "a fraud", and has ruled that he should not be appointed to the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "a fraud" and said that this would not qualify him to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during a Saturday talk at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't imagine how I could ever think that a woman has ever 'been to me, in that way'" Pelosi said in her testimony on Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied allegations that he had attempted to have sex with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh expressed a strong sense of humor, at times even threatening and insulting, about his family and school years.
He also immediately criticized the Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against them were "basic and aimed at damaging the image" of the people who were upset with Hillary Clinton's exit from the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he was convinced that Kavanaugh's impeachment was a clear indication of his unfitness to serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed his political hatred.
"I think they've just gotten away with it by the way they've been talking and the way they've been talking to the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was asked if she would consider removing Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats hold a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if they're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then they shouldn't be on the Supreme Court, but they should be on the court that they're on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about whether Kavanaugh will rule on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is thought to be a conservative judge.
In his impeachment trial, Kavanaugh failed to answer questions about the interpretation of certain Supreme Court rulings.
"This is the time for a rich man, who is biased, to come to our court and expect us to say, 'It's all right,'" said Pelosi.
Mothers Need to Be Respected Too.
A word of truth is a fury, months and months of fury, it cannot keep silent.
"We always cry when we are angry", Aunt Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think that's very common, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman who, when I was a leader in one place, said that she would cry if she was angry, but she had one thing in common: whenever she got angry and started to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You must think I'm angry because I'm crying.
I'm really upset".
He goes on to say: "The one who is born from above is like the one who has come from below.
And I thought that was fair".
Tears seem to be the source of anger on one side because they are misunderstood.
One of the vivid memories of my first job, in a male-dominated office, where I cried bitter tears of disappointment, was being held in a crate by an older woman - a harsh supervisor whom I had always feared - who carried me up the stairs.
"Don't let anyone see you crying", she told me.
"They didn't know I was mad.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they've defeated you".
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on presidential missions.
In 1987, after Hart was caught with another woman aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder, in a fit of rage, began to think about how he could avoid running for president himself.
"It was not a well-prepared bed", he told me after 30 years with a laugh.
"There were seven other men who were competing in that competition, and they were looking for the next one.
One person compared it to the story "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was on a tight budget, he promised not to stop until he had raised $2 million.
It was a brutal battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters had donated $1,000 to the men, while others had given $250.
"Do they think I'm a loan shark?" she thought.
When they publicly announced that they would not launch their campaign, they were overwhelmed by the various regrets - praising their supporters, being annoyed by the campaign's emphasis on profit and fairness over equality, and being angry at the fact that they were being persecuted for being women - that had led to their downfall.
"You would think that my body would be damaged", recalled Schroeder when the news began to report about him.
"You might think that the Kleenex are my backers
I remember thinking, 'What will they put on my tombstone?'
"Did they cry?"
How a trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The initial tensions in the trade war between the US and China have been high, and while the conflict is far from over, the newly created border between the two countries could be a boon to Beijing in the future, the spokesperson said.
Donald Trump, the US President, was the first to offer a first-round reprieve this year when he imposed tariffs on all Chinese goods, including solar panels, steel and metals.
In addition to the $200 billion (£150 billion) in tariffs this week, the US is also expected to collect a fifth of all imports from China.
Beijing has reversed the trend by imposing a 5 to 10 percent tax on up to $60 billion of goods.
China has promised to engage the US as it wishes, and the world's second largest economy will not be deterred.
To make Washington proud is to give in to the will of its allies, but to bow to the US would be the ultimate insult to Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, analysts say that if Beijing is able to manage the situation, the US trade war could benefit China in the long run by reducing the economic dependence between the two countries.
"The fact that the world is so easily distracted by either Washington or Beijing could create some sort of trade disruption between the two countries that would be more dangerous than anything that has been seen before", said Abigail Grace, a senior Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is not ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria has said it is ready to welcome back refugees and is seeking a plan to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the world was improving.
"Today's world is a safer place because of the work done in preventing crime", they said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas damaged by terrorists in order to restore the country to its former glory.
All the possibilities are there for those who wish to return to the country they left because of the violent attacks and the economic situation that has made their lives and their lives miserable.
The UN estimates that up to 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the civil war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the interior of the country also need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would accept any assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But they emphasized that they would not accept any aid that included provisions for aid from countries that had not been willing to accept it.
Europeans win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US team has now won six consecutive European Ryder Cups and has not won a European Ryder Cup since 1993.
The European team won when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 tons needed to beat the United States.
The US's Phil Mickelson, who dominated the event, took his tee shot to the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been the most successful golfer of all time, becoming one of the four golfers to achieve a perfect 5-0-0 record since the sport's inception in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was beaten 5-4 by the lowest European on the team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World-renowned player Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter in what would be his final Ryder Cup match.
One of the eight players to compete in the Ryder Cup, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European record holder with 25.5 tons.
"I'm not used to crying, but today I can't stand it.
This has been a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas for taking me in and believing in me.
I have a lot of fun recycling.
All the credit goes to the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, who was thrilled after the European victory.
He credited his teammate John Ram with beating US champion Tiger Woods 2-1 in a one-on-one match on Sunday.
"The greatest pride I have is beating Tiger Woods, and I've never seen that guy", said Rahm, now 23.
Woods has played all four of his matches for France and currently has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
The list is complicated by the fact that the world's most famous golfer, who has won 14 major titles, is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA has been struggling all weekend to find a place except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been the most successful players in all of the tournament.
Team captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighting hard.
It is a morning when we are most vulnerable to Europeans.
We went upstairs.
I would like to thank Thomas.
He is a mighty ruler.
All 12 of his teachers have done very well.
We're going to work on it, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
Give commendation when appropriate.
We have lost the power to deal with it".
Red Tide warning: Less visible in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
Recent reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicate a decline in the Red Tide population in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, a decrease in the number of cases was reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating that the number of cases was decreasing.
The Red Tide flows 130 miles across the ocean from the southwest at Pinellas to the south at Lee.
The plains can be found about 10 miles from the Hillsborough County summit, but are much smaller than they were this week.
Red Tide has also been spotted in Pasco County.
The highest reported incidence in Pinellas County was recorded last week, the lowest reported incidence in coastal Hillsborough County, the highest reported incidence in Manatee County, the lowest reported in Sarasota County, the lowest reported in Charlotte County, the highest reported incidence in coastal Lee County, and the lowest reported in Collier County.
Human-wildlife attacks were reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
A stabbing was reported in Northwest Florida last week.
