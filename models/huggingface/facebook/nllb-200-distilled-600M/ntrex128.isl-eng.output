Welsh counselors worry about looking like a floppy
Some councillors are upset about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns have been raised by a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh Parliament.
Councillors from all walks of life are concerned that this could make them feel uncomfortable.
A Labour councillor said his party was concerned that it was "rhythm with the Twp and the Pwp".
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means foolish and pwp means sour.
A Plaid Cymru councillor said the party as a whole was "overjoyed" and made other suggestions for the celebration.
A Welsh Conservative councillor said his party had "opened its mind" to the name change, but pointed out that there was little difference between the term MWP and Muppet (flot).
In this context, it can be inferred that the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Icelandic letter u.
The Council, which is now working on a legislative proposal to propose the name changes, said: "The decision on the legal status of all the names of the members of the Council will of course be left to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council released the results of a public opinion poll that showed strong support for calling the Council a parliamentary body.
As for the title of councillors, the council elected the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, Welsh MPs) but the MWP received the most public support in the opinion polls.
According to reports, council members are now making other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach agreement with council president Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft amendment within weeks.
The reform campaign will also include other changes to the way the Council operates, including rules on the discharge of Council members and the organisation of the committee system.
Members will be able to pay their final vote on the title when the debate on the bill begins.
Macedonians vote in the name change elections in the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This matter was put to a vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its neighbours in the north have a claim to their name and has repeatedly opposed their EU and NATO membership applications.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the name change vote, has said he will not consider the election valid.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The church bells of St. Martin's sound are churches in Harlem having difficulties
'The elderly people I spoke to said that before there had to be a bar and a church on every street corner,' said Mr. Adams.
Today, none of them are found there.
He said it was understandable that children's carloads were decreasing.
People have other ways to meet these days, he said.
Bars are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people gather regularly.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders are expected to and sooner or later they will return to their original roots.
He added that churches could be replaced with apartment buildings that were full of people who would not help save the remaining neighborhood's garrisons.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, he said,and will therefore hasten the closure of these churches for good, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a center for blacks - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation broke down in the 1940's.
A local congregation of Witnesses took over the building.
A congregation of shopkeepers took over St. Martin's Church, led by Sir John Howard Johnson, who had initiated the design of shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who insisted on hiring shopkeepers or raising their wages.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but members of the Serra Johnson Congregation made plans to rebuild it and also had the clock tower built.
Sir David Johnson, son and successor of Sir Johnson, called the clock the proud clock of the poor.
The expert who played the clock in July called it another name: Cultural Treasure and Extract Historical Instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first clock to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger clock at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's would have had no one else in his place.
In recent months, numerous architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the diocese.
The church council - which oversees the visit and has appointed church leaders - wrote to the bishopric in July expressing its concern that the bishopric would seek to overcome the cost of the church council, even though it would not have been involved in the appointment of the architects and tools sent by the bishopric.
Some of the attackers complained of a lack of visibility from the bishopric.
Shark wounds 13-year-old boy who was caving for lobster in California
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while he was cooking lobster in California on the first day of the lobster harvest season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been drinking with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then ran over with a group of others to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just the excitement of having reached lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
"Everything that was pointing at him was torn up", Hammel told what he saw when he reached the boy.
I shouted at everyone to come up from the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken in a helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Coast Guard officer Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim's upper body had been severely damaged.
Authorities closed the beaches from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swamis Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours, for investigative and security reasons.
Giles said that over 135 different species of sharks were present in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's with plans to open a grocery store in the UK
Sainsbury's is going to have a go-go with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a shopping mall-style makeup kit and a trained assistant.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is growing steadily as fashion and home goods salons decline. The larger beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and installed in more stores next year if successful.
Cosmetic investments are part of a larger market approach to using a shelf space that was previously used by televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it plans to double its beauty product line to 3,000 brands, including brands on board with Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive increased space with marked areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The store also plans to resume sales of its boutique line of fashion items so that the majority of its products are vegan, but younger consumers demand it more and more.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test out the product standings at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, south London last week and the next opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The online retail and the increasing trend of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily at local stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would be more like shopping malls as the chain tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl grocery stores with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced the number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago, which they say has increased sales and made purchases more profitable.
The store's first attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical products failed.
Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots around 2000 but ended up with a dispute over how to share the proceeds of drug sales in the supermarket.
The new policy follows the sale of Sainsbury's' 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd's, for £125 million three years ago.
Under the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Marketing Director, said: "We've changed the look of our beauty products to make the environment better for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be available for counselling.
Our branded range is designed to meet all needs, and a healthy environment and comfortable location make us an exciting beauty shop that transforms old shopping habits.
Peter Jones is retiring after Holly Willoughby quits his £11 million contract.
Peter Jones, the star of the show Dragons Den, became a professional after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million contract with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been similar to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
Willoughby, 37, a host on This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, with a painful legacy by quitting her popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and unforgettable deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Reports say Jones was the target of a difficult meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the TV personality admitted she didn't have enough time for the home goods and accessories brand Truly due to new deals worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been likened to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, but their estimated value is £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was retiring from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
A host said, "Truly was dropped from Holly's list.
This was to be her future work that would earn her income for the next two decades.
Her decision to retire was completely unpublished.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went to market.
There is a full stock of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to go on sale.
Experts believe that the breakout of This Morning, one of Britain's most popular stars, could cost the company millions of dollars in investments, from powders and cutlery to clothing and household items, and possibly further damage to the line.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends with Jones and Toru Capp, his wife, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman of the board in March.
The couple spend their summer vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, a television production company.
Willoughby will become the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A close confidant of Jones said last night: "We don't want to say anything about his business".
We had a hard time and then we fell in love.
He was rebuked by the media for saying something many would find inappropriate for the president and for being so positive in the garden of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much away?
Trump and his troops said in a reporter's voice.
I haven't left anything.
He noted that Kim would be interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, talks on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June Singapore summit, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's top ambassador, told an international summit of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received an "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's initial steps toward nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the United States kept trading with the United States to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his speech.
"We're very close to North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of individuals would have lost their lives.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim had been successful - missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the underground remains of U.S. troops had been returned home.
He also used an unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into the crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause extensive damage to the island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population had to flee their homes, the emergency was not declared, but it is a prerequisite for international relief efforts.
"In many cases, however, they have made it clear that they will not seek international assistance, so this is difficult", said Mr Sumbung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear when foreign aid workers will be able to work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country's shark relief agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief effort.
In view of the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately ill-prepared to protect itself from natural forces.
Floodwaters have been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
So it seems that the demand for flood protection vessels in Palu has continued to increase in casualties, even after a warning was issued.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters make planning even more difficult.
An ambulance that has been docking in Lombok to watch for earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made it a key part of his election campaign to rebuild Indonesia's declining transportation system and has invested heavily in roads and railways.
The lack of funds has plagued Mr Joko's administration, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with the ongoing tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religious approach.
Over 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes, and Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with daggers, bows, and spears and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, tied against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a transmission from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal. His team was down 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to hit the target in the direction of the pole.
The bullet flew high over the boundary and toward its right corner.
The bullet eventually passed through Cape Arrizabalaga, which popped up, and went online.
"I just wanted to try to get to this position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as fast as possible so I tried to make as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and touch once and didn't think so much about it, but just took the shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 down in the semi-final after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the attack, the Chelsea forward handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with a heel and then jumped from the centre to Liverpool's goal.
Kovacic let the ball go fast in the middle.
Then he sent the ball forward gracefully and sent Hazard in for a win.
Hazard fled the defenders and scored in the penalty shootout against Liverpool's goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the final of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesia's flood
The death toll from the earthquake and floods in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report from the country's Maritime Administration early Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization, told a news conference that many people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday that caused flooding waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was the scene of a roof collapse.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a spinal cord injury was found at 7:55 a.m. near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O'Hagan, the investigator, said: "The investigation is correct, but I would like to ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have caught something in their car cameras to contact us, because they could have overwritten important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who died was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
This afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are working to inform the victim's immediate family.
A train driver in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours may take them to get back inside.
A police officer was told that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the stage crying.
She repeats again and again, "This is so horrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the area of the police station and one car just outside.
A number of police officers were present within the area's signage and were monitoring the housing developments.
Anyone with any information is invited to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Skyline anonymously at 0800 555 111 and provide the number 247 as of September 30.
The British Parliament's Cromwell Memorial is the latest monument accused of "re-writing history".
The statue's ban would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of its ultra-religious Puritan followers of so many of England's cultural and religious demons.
However, the Cromwell Society said Mr. Crick's proposal was a "phase" and an attempt to re-enact history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be the scene of the battle.
The English Civil War against the Cultural Monuments was neither a Cromwell order nor an execution.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistakes would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier.
The glorious statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a 19th-century symbol of the spirit of the times and a part of the history of a man who many believe is still praised.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to have been the protector of the House of Commons against external pressure, in his case the Crown.
Whether this statement is entirely correct remains a matter of much historical debate.
However, it is clear that the conflicts of the mid-17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known figure representing one side of their conflict.
His success as a protector of the State is worthy of praise and memory.
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him.
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, local reports said.
The man, who is known only by his surname Yuan, was found dead of a massive stroke and blood clot near a rock market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to a report by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject boiled matter into pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and found the door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said that inside the stall there had been a large hole with a bloody mouth.
A court investigation confirmed that the 250-pound adult killed the victim, according to the report.
'My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded,' the uncle, nicknamed Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told the Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that it would not attack anyone else while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the owners of the market are in talks about compensation for his facial expression.
There are recorded instances of pig attacks, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their town in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig clutched a Welsh farmer to a wire mill until his wife grazed the animal in a crack.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually attackers, but that blood spatter can trigger an attack.
They're just playing.
They want to play the game and they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect, he said.
The remnants of the falling Rose bear a large impact over the southwestern United States
As predicted, the Rosalind's force is decreasing, crossing a shallow peninsula on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the storm will carry heavy rainfall that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa became a Category 1 hurricane with winds of up to 100 miles per hour (136 km/h) at 5 a.m. eastern coast time on Sunday, and it was located about 600 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is scheduled to head northwest on Sunday.
At the same time, it is forming across the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Roses will be accompanied by up to 25 centimeters of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical storm will blend with the approaching rainfall, creating a large and widespread outbreak over the southwest in the coming days.
A temporary 2.5 to 10 cm [2.5 to 10 cm] of precipitation can cause dangerous flash floods, earthquakes, and possible desert roaring.
A major tropical storm will cause up to 5 to 10 inches of rainfall per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas in the southwest, especially most of Arizona, are expected to experience as much as 5 to 10 inches of precipitation.
Emergency floods with rapidly declining conditions are possible because of the prevalence of global warming.
People are strongly advised against walking out into the desert when there is a risk of global warming.
Heavy rain can turn the tide into a rapidly blowing storm, bringing with it whistle and thunderstorms.
The approaching storm will bring local recreation to certain areas along the coastline of Southern California.
The possibility is that about 1 cm of effluent could cause minor movement on the ground and neck on roads.
This is the first production of the area during the rainy season.
Some distributed tropical storms will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the outbreak spreads to larger areas late Monday and Tuesday.
A major outing will spread across four states on Tuesday and end on Wednesday.
A major change in temperature in October is expected throughout the United States as the North Sea cools but the heat wave remains fairly warm.
Sometimes this can cause severe heat waves along short roads.
Consider a very good example of a severe heat wave in the central United States on Sunday.
It's almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the permanent summer solstice will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start in October, with temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius or higher from the plains in the south to the northeastern United States.
The temperature could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecasts suggest that there is a high probability of warming above average in the eastern United States in early October.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court justice, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct that was supposed to have taken place in the 1990's.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, and television stations broke their regular news schedule on Friday: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona introduced a bill allowing the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to disguise her in a school party.
Kavanaugh testified in an emotional statement that he was confident that it had not happened.
More people likely watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company recommended mediocre viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other television stations that aired the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has trouble measuring people's attitudes in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to the football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most of the day-long hearings were watched on Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million people.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS owned 3.1 million, NBC owned 2.94 million, MSNBC owned 2.89 million, and CNN owned 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, there was still a lot of interest.
Flake was the centerpiece of the Friday night game.
After the office of this Republican congressman announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favor of CNN and CBS receiving pictures of protesters attacking him on Friday morning, he attempted to get into an elevator to attend a meeting with the Judiciary Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while he was shaming on CNN's live broadcast.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
Do you think he's telling the truth to his countrymen?
People said to him, "You have power while so many women have power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the doors closed he said he would speak more at the committee meeting.
The cable and television networks were all live broadcasting later when the Judiciary Committee decided whether to continue Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate election.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee within the next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake was convinced in part after talking to his friend, Chris Coons, a Democratic senator.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other Senators after that.
Flake's vote changed dramatically because it was clear that Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the poll.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of being in a political game over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing a political game" over Britain's future and of minimizing its interests.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, speaks at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview, published alongside her cover story, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, acknowledged the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the UK and EU to cut tariffs on the other side was "absolutely lacking".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson in connection with the LSU star's face
Police have arrested one suspect in connection with the face of Wayde Sims in a shooting accident.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge State Police.
Authorities posted a video of Sims and Simpson's fight, saying Sims lost his glasses in the attacks.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS' sister company.
Police say Simpson has admitted to the hearing that he shot and tortured Wayde.
According to his lawyer, a settlement was reached for $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released a press release Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
Authorities would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Special Branch, the Police Criminal Investigation Department, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked law enforcement for their bravery and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-1 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played baseball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU's head baseball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "harmless and hurt" because of Wayde's face.
"This is something you've been worried about for a long time", Wade said.
A volcano is blowing through Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexican workers on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased sharply, recording 183 cases of gas and noise emissions in a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by a titanium and earthquakes from the volcano.
Social media footage showed a thin layer of noise in car parks in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, located about 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake in the Richter Range over central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in the conflict with the Catalan separatist right to an anniversary of independence referendum
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence-minded protesters were attacked by police and thousands took part in protests marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence declaration.
A group of masked separatists roasted eggs of a police officer and threw powdered paint into the streets, which were usually crowded with tourists.
Drugs also broke out later that day, and police used refrigerators to keep traffic in the shops.
The separatist groups shouted: "We will not forget and forgive for several hours", while their opponents shouted: "Long live Spain".
Fourteen had to be evacuated because of minor injuries they sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions continue in the region, one year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by the Madrid authorities, but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but participation was low as most of those who opposed the split ignored the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed last year when police tried to stop elections at polling stations across the region, but there was fighting.
Independent groups had spent Friday night outside to prevent a protest in support of the country's police.
The opposition continued but was forced to go the other way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrical engineer, joined his wife in the separation protests and said he was no longer anxious about Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they were able to get married, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite winning a necessary but modest victory in regional elections last December, Catalonia's independence parties have had a difficult year to hold their ground, with many of their most prominent leaders either in voluntary exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the vote and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old engineer who picked up the protest in support of the police on her phone, said that state politicians had encouraged the dispute.
"The tension is increasing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"My representative in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backlash against democratic values and the repression we have seen the Spanish government commit", he said.
London: People arrested after a car hit a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested for repeatedly driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Bob Blemmings, the investigator, said that the side and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that the gun was fired from a crossbow toward the vehicle.
Menga scores in a 1-0 win over Livingston Rangers
First goal Dolly Menga secured victory for Livingston
Livingston's lower-league side, the Rangers, came out on an open sheet and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox's manager.
Mark Dolly Menga made the qualifying and Gary Holtz's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has yet to win a playoff game this season and will play the No. 1 seed Hearts next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt's head coach has yet to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is wasting his opportunity to welcome his guests
Holts' team should have been over long before they scored a goal, but their direct advantage caused the Rangers great problems.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but snapped in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot forward after running through the defence to receive a shell transmission from Graig Halkett across the finish line.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause trouble for the guests in the right places.
And that's how the importance threshold was set.
The Rangers were given a new lead, and Livingston worked to create a brand new opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson helping out Menga in a joint effort, which took the lead and scored from the middle of the field.
At that point, the Rangers had taken over the ball, but the defense of the home-fielders was impeccable and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, didn't have to put much effort into it.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend himself from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was shot from the field after a jump from Livingston.
Questions continued to land in Livingston's widow but were kicked off, and two claims for a widow's widow - after Halketts' defense against Deputy Glenn Middleton, and one after his hand - were rejected.
Livingston's "Gladly" - The Study
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A great performance and a great finish for Livingston.
For the average person, they stood out and kept going above all expectations.
Their playing style and teammates have hardly changed anything since they returned to the top flight, but Holt has much credit for having pulled the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the league was extremely good and led a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes the whole time.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they've been under Gerrard's command, they've come a long way from expectations.
They were unable to complete their raid and only once managed to open up half the home court, so this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the league.
Erdogan receives a blind reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the two NATO nations.
There have been disputes between them over issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey itself.
The police used security measures to prevent 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but a number of supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German authorities to invite him to the country.
The two opposition groups reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford crash: A cyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics provided an ambulance, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a collision with a driver on Childers Street, 1.5 km from the accident site on Saturday.
Police said they were working on identifying the man and letting his immediate family know.
The road is being closed and buses are being diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guests injured in the riots
Six guards were injured when a gang broke into a male prison, according to a report from the prison's correctional facility.
Violence broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9.30am local time on Sunday and is still raging.
Special forces have been called to the area to try to contain the riots, which have killed eight prisoners, and are in only one cell.
The guards were compensated for minor facial injuries on the field.
A prison administration spokesman said: "Special guards have been called to handle the ongoing case at Long Lartin Prison.
Six workers have been suspended for injuries.
There has been no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the people responsible will be turned over to the police and could be expected to spend even more time behind bars and beaten.
More than 500 inmates are in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden had to go to the hospital after being attacked.
And in October last year, a police force was called to the scene to address a serious peaceful protest, in which workers were attacked with small arms.
The Yellow Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (drought zones could benefit)
Tropical storms rarely strike Arizona, but they are likely to do so early next week as the remnants of the Rosean fly over the southwest, threatening flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is scheduled to make her way over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with a departure.
The Phoenix Weather Bureau said on Twitter that only 20 field lights have managed to maintain strength to be classified as tropical storms or -lands within a radius of more than 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a catastrophe less than 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The latest forecast from the National Weather Service predicted 5 to 10 inches of leakage, with a leakage of up to 15 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to produce between 2.5 and 5 cm (2.5 and 5 inches) of yield, with the potential for individual yields up to 10 cm (2.5 inches).
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the result of Rosu could be a blessing given the severe drought in the area.
Although flooding can cause great damage, some of this yield will have a positive effect, as the southwest is now in drought.
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, at least 40 percent of Arizona is heavily arid, but it's the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the catfish Rosa will land in the Bay of California, in Mexico.
Rosa continued to storm on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 135 miles per hour (620 km/h) and is 620 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, traveling north at 19 miles per hour.
The storm crosses the shallow Pacific Ocean, reducing its force.
So it is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or Monday night.
There is a possibility of large yields in some areas of Mexico, with significant flood risks.
Bushes are expected to reach 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into northwestern Sonora, with a potential for up to 25 cm in precipitation, said a weather.com report.
Rosa will then continue north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, then continuing up through Arizona and reaching southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat to the species or its remains is very high yields in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert regions of the United States", said the National Wildlife Refuge Center.
These results are expected to result in life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the deserts, and screeching in the mountains.
The Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The police have called witnesses who may have been wiretapping the incident to report themselves.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been exposed to the evil and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and unfair practices of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to the evil and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination campaign.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee on his allegations.
The president said Saturday that the United States had seen Kavanaugh's bravery, manhood and courage the other day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a glorious career as a public servant", he told a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters participating in the midterm elections.
It's five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not offering, but I'm doing it for real, he said.
That's why I go around the big city square to fight for the great candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats were working to "destroy and hinder".
The first round of voting on the floor of the Senate Committee on Aging for Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, according to an aide to the Republican presidential candidate in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds died in an earthquake and flood in Indonesia, and the death toll is likely to rise
At least 384 people were killed and many more were evacuated when a massive tsunami struck the coastline, as a massive earthquake and flood swept across the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter-high wave hit the beach at sunset, plunging crowds out to sea, destroying everything that happened to them.
The flood wave was formed by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tidal wave formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, so it killed people", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Maritime Authority, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The flood did not come by itself, it swept away cars, log cabins, houses, and swept away everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the flood had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers before hitting the shore.
Some climbed trees to escape the flood and survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people were transported to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Maritime Commission showed many destroyed buildings and shops, snow and unused bridges, and mosques surrounding the water.
Aftermaths continued to sweep the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute of Food and Technology said in a statement that the energy released from the earthquake's epicenter on Friday was about 200 times greater than that released from the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical location, which is at the end of a long, narrow river, may have increased the size of the flood, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "real" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Several victims' bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and property could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala that is close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications are down and no information is coming from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"About 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the areas.
"This has already become a tragedy, but it could get much worse", said the Red Cross.
The organization was criticized by many on Saturday for not reporting flooding on the Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived before the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, a man could hear screams from the top of a building to warn people on the street that a flood was approaching.
Just minutes later, the tide hits the coast, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and flood caused power outages that disrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to organize relief efforts.
The military has begun sending aid planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport has only just reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, the president, is going to visit refugee camps in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia's floods is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have been able to reach the city of Palu, where they are seeking shelter in tent cities that were set up in the park outside their offices.
"People said they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid teams have begun a difficult relief effort, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with a high level of expertise are being hindered from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, stocks and personnel can only start arriving if the disaster area is declared a shore area.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a localised disaster area", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared this a hamster area, we can open up to foreign aid, but no announcement has yet been made.
As the second night fell on Paul after the earthquake and flood of Friday, friends and families of the missing were hoping that their loved ones would be among the miraculous stories that cast a spark of hope on the devastating predictions of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a raft.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian team, had been coaching two missing squad for the Asian team that finished earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others locked inside the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a man with long experience in aviation, I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Mr Gendon said that within hours of the news from the airline group that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he had sent a desperate WhatsApp message to the contestants staying in Palu and participating in the beach party.
His message, however, was only a grey sign, not a blue one.
"I think that means the messages were not received", he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 cases at a fast-food bank in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, 26,750 items were stolen from Brink's employee who was filling a fast bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been hitting a fast bank at the amusement park and was filling it with more money, police spokesman Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was at work, another man came running after Brink's employee and stole the money bag that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee the scene, according to the report, but police did not say how many were involved.
Anyone with information about the suspect is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: Veran, formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Arionne Grande on the show, but she left for "emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
West has previously said that this name has religious significance for him, but it is also an abbreviation of his current name.
"I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier that year when discussing the name of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm you, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- to just be a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the messed up, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West associate, has also written his name with and without a band-aid and a pencil.
The elected president of Mexico is called not to use the military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has called for never using military force against civilians, now that the country will soon commemorate 50 years of bloody student vengeance.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in the square, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were firing roots across Roman America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving every student a monthly scholarship and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of schooling facilities have led to youths becoming criminals.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in that field, says inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The complaint was made after various departments of the U.S. government issued notices of artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal comprehensive plan for artificial intelligence.
China, however, announced its plan last year: it aims to be the world's number one innovator in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the amount of money spent on satellite research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we look forward to seeing the next big discoveries in the field of satellite research", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big satellite discovery being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's largest satellite companies.
He worked on artificial intelligence systems in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, winning the U.S. Best Actor award for Othello, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese division of Google.
Lee spoke about previous technology competitions, held by the US government, such as the Department of Defense's robotics competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to bring the next initiatives to the fore.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding", Lee said.
"It's not China that likes its main ideas, it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work on artificial intelligence in the past year.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its satellite research.
"I think those with a PhD in artificial intelligence should get their residency permits automatically", he said.
The Chinese Congress published its future Mining Plan in July 2017.
The Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people who work at universities, similar to what the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a satellite research center, designed to work with both industry and education, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on satellite research.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it invests over $100 million annually in research on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation designed to create a safety net for artificial intelligence has been in the works for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has closed its application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, and it claims that its northern neighbors' names were equivalent to their territorial claims and thus denied entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June that was based on the new name, but ethnically opposed parties claim that the change will obliterate the identity of the majority of Macedonian people of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts about the minimum turnout of 50 percent needed to qualify for the vote.
The question on the ballot is: Do you want to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a fair price for Macedonia to join alliance laws like the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those that were formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
'I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While the resolution is not legally binding, many members of parliament have said they will follow it and enforce it.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The Electoral Commission said no unusual incident had been reported at 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
'I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,' said 62-year-old Gose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the country's name, but it would pave the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, won the small stage and set up chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who would ignore the ballot.
"We are ignorant of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not go through the service doors", Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we live above dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can either turn to China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO will send necessary funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
'I think the vast majority will agree that over 80 percent of the country is ignoring the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that acceptance would be the "firm ground for our future".
A poll published Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that is lower than the minimum required.
A second poll by Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would say yes.
To be valid, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could be the first serious blow to the government's policy, which has been ignored by the West since it took effect in May last year.
Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all of Brighton's defenses and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took the lead with Brighton's 2-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine army received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He jumped three of Brighton's defenders and then went out on the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad guards.
He passed one of the defenders and then ran off a few more just outside Brighton Beach.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touch inside the wicket to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play on Brighton's Mathew Ryan, a goalkeeper, with a shot in the right side of the field.
"Aguero is in some kind of footing trouble", Pep Guardiola, City's CEO, told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal of the playoffs.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a transmission far inland from the port of Brighton in that raid.
He sent a glorious long left-handed ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball a couple of times and then sent Sterling towards the quarterback.
City's offensive lineman sent the ball online just before it went off.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a losing game against the Rockies.
Since the Nationals have been ruled out of the playoffs, there was little reason to push for a second start.
But the rival Scherzer hopes to get a pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to make the playoffs, but they have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Conference.
The Rockies earned at least a wildcard berth with their 5-2 win at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to win its first division title.
Even if we play for free, we can at least play for the electrical atmosphere in Denver and the other team will surely play their best game this year.
Why should I not want to compete in such situations?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday's game, but they're expected to let Scherzer pitch under these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start the game for the 34th time, took a practice boot on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, his usual rest day.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is visiting West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Justice, when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters participating in the midterm elections.
It's all set in November.
It's five weeks into one of the most important choices of our lives.
These are some of the big, big... I don't offer, but I do, which is why I go all over the field to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them.
He said the Democrats were working to stop and hinder.
And this has been happening for the last four days, he said, and he said that Democrats are rioters and evil and cruel and uncontrollable.
He named Senate Minority Leader Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic nominee for the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was met with a loud response from the audience.
Did you guys remember her answer?
Was it you who was unleashing the file?
What?
I was just waiting for one... it was really bad physical training, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a church-oriented party.
He Does Not Endorse Anyone Who Expresses His Mind
When the Momentum of my class chose to recommend me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last of many Labour MPs to have been told we're not welcome just to express our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my fellow congresswoman, was treated in a similar way because she strongly opposed the accusations against Jews.
In my case, the opportunity to give me advice came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, coldly similar issues, and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that 'we want the meetings to be transparent and effective.'
In my eight years as a Labour MP, Friday's meetings have been the most successful.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a more moderate and better government has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not endemic in the Labour Party and that all views are judged by whether the party leaders consider them objectionable.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues, who I thought had previously shared my political views, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support views that I had never previously agreed with, whether it was national security or a common EU market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there is a lot of social media hype about my breach, the rejection of the central government and the idea that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those who have to endure a daily cycle of sexual or prejudicial behavior but never harden.
One of the most frustrating things about this political era is how attacks and discouragement have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should be vigilant about the pervasive culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a church-oriented group, and with each disbelief or change in policy, the group will become more and more tense.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years about keeping my weight low, not getting too high, and then I'd be okay.
But I chose not to get involved in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the Thatcher government's neglect of the school district, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most, whether I was in the city council or in parliament.
I've never given up my political opinions, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my beliefs and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who voted on Friday's proposal, I just want to say that when the country moves to Brexit, which will hurt our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand the urge to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my only message I want to send is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threat of provocation or political interference will deter me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr team to the top
Two late touchdowns could have shaken the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this brilliant game of the day in the Tennents Premiership.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team out of 10 still undefeated.
In the end, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the natives more successful and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
"We've had tough resistance in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "They're so proud of themselves, they took their chances better than we did".
Mark Grant Anderson took over Ayr on the 14th minute after Frazier Climo returned the attack, but a yellow kick on the Scottish side, who were allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers count and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo went on to lead Ayr by a wide margin before scoring a kick just before the semi-final and then a touchdown, leading Ayr to a 17-5 draw.
But the Melrose started the second half of the game with strength and touchdown, Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned the offense, cut the score to five points.
Gera then had to play a long game to watch for serious injuries from Ruaridh Knott, who had to take off the field, after which Ayr continued his lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo returned to attack.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's captain, was then awarded the yellow card and Melrose reused himself as a man with a touch of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard attack.
However, the home side came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded the yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown from behind Ayr's shoulder, after extra effort.
Climo turned the offense on, as he did again shortly after the resumption, after Kyle Rowe caught David Amrstrong's kickoff from the wicket and sent it to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown.
Still Game stars of the show ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the show Still Game, seems poised to move into restaurant business after it emerged that he was hired as CEO of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, stars as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in alongside his old entertainment partner, Creg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it appears Kiernan has plans for Craiglang's life.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the news, but the Scottish Sun reporter insisted Kiernan wanted to be involved in the live restaurant industry in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: This coastal country of Bolivia hopes that a court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are guarding the Navy's headquarters in La Paz.
The buildings are all blue flags.
The fleet stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it.
But for all of the rest of the landlocked Bolivia, the poverty of the coastline, lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century, is still fresh in my mind - along with the longing to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of long-standing trials.
"Bolivia is full of power, unity and inequality, and of course, it is waiting for the decision with a positive mindset", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the International Court of Justice's ruling on a nationwide scale, hoping that the Hague court will decide Bolivia's claim that Chile must grant access to Bolivia after decades of difficult negotiations.
Monday's decision is also crucial for Evo Morales, the country's Indian president who will be in a contentious re-election race next year.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
But some commentators believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and that doing so would make little difference.
The court, which is based in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant land to Sile and has stated that the ruling will not affect the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the court's decision comes just six months after the final hearing suggests that the case "should not have been complicated", said Paz Sárate, a Syrian expert on international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been a case of rape for Bolivia, but rather a retaliatory one.
"The current government of Bolivia has stolen the right of access to the sea", Zaraté said.
Morales' military rhetoric has drawn all the goodwill from Sile, she said.
Bolivia and Silas will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would have taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have the unique opportunity to open new ties with Chile and to end a dispute that goes back 139 years, for the benefit of both countries, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Roman America, was using this issue as a political stunt.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to settle down in the past.
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, says the country will never withdraw its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor the promises made at a meeting of the leaders of the nations in Singapore.
His appeal is now that Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume nuclear talks, more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a nightmare" to maintain that continued U.S. trade bans and protests against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever strike North Korea.
Washington will not accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes clear action to disarm its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at a second meeting.
However, there are serious doubts that Pyongyang is seriously taking down its weapons, which the country likely sees as the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows showcase the latest line of large headwear that will be available at fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely isolated from the sun, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designed a variety of oversized, curved hats for their SS19 line in the fashion industry that featured the fashion week in Paris.
Many photos of very innocent faces have been posted on Instagram over the summer, and these designers have had their innovative creations featured in fashion shows.
Valentino's main work was a large light brown hat with wide beards that resembled feathers and covered the heads of models.
Other large-scale supporters could see watermelons fitted with gems, onion caps, and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a lot of weird makeup, just in time for the holidays.
Many of the colorful masks had a composite look and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than a festive one.
One was like a cooking machine with a breathing tube and a glass eye, while the other was like a baking ice cream.
If you want to fool around in this suit, luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the large hats could soon be on sale in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come from the hips of La Bomba, a boy's hat with over 60cm of weight that has decorated heads ranging from Rihona to Emily Ratajkowski.
The tag on the back of the highly unfashionable hat, which was seen on all social media, was the inspiration for another large following that appeared on the fashion scene  a beach-top bag made of garlic that was almost as large as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The orange-blue streetcar, with bus signs and a white leather handle, was the main feature of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS10 fatality at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity fashion designer, told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing big hats and beach boots appear in fashion stores next summer - as the designer has made such a big impact, it should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland are renowned for their outstanding student achievement and have continued in 2018 with new, elegant test centres, which are still supported by individual and group engagement in sport, the arts, music and other community centres.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge, and they strive to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career path, and their status as global citizens.
As a teacher who can assemble and teach according to customized curricula, we see that the subject continues to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it touches their mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
This year's results show that languages are at the top of the list with the highest percentage of students passing exams in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received the A grade.
The data, collected from 74 schools within SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received their A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received their A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages, which are essential skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
At present, selected languages are placed in the same place as academic subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons employers found it difficult to hire were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As language skills become increasingly demanding in today's busy world, they are essential.
No matter what career path people choose, learning another language will have a real impact on their future, but it is a lifelong experience.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will give a diverse person an automatic advantage over competitors.
According to a survey of over 4,000 British adults by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to keep conversations going, and French was the only language spoken by two-letter prospects, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for today's children to invest immediately in language learning.
Multipathism, especially in newly-emerging countries, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, the language taught varies from school to school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical subjects, while others will teach languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child's interests lie, they will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with trained teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of the future.
There is no denying that at this time, in a global business environment, language continues to be essential for the future of our country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern communication should really be viewed as a global communication skill.
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and excitement to young people in Scotland.
It's good to be back.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game of the regular season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be longer than a minute and shorter than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't have to play games before the game to prepare", he said.
Timings for the Trump election in West Virginia and YouTube streams
President Donald Trump will hold a series of elections, the first of which is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he'll also stop in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to a new Supreme Court justice has been called, Trump is planning to build support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
What time is Trump's election in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM Eastern Time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below via a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to be leading the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's nominee, as tensions have escalated over allegations of sexual assault.
But the main goal of Trump's meetings is to help Republicans get better at their own game, while they await the tough election in November.
So the message from Trump's campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at "enhancing volunteer and supportive firepower" and that Republicans are trying to protect and increase their Senate and House majority, according to Reuters.
"Congress is so essential to the president's plan that he will travel to as many states as possible and a second campaign may be underway", an unnamed spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
The meeting will be held tonight at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and Pittsburgh media will report it, according to the West Virginia Metro News Agency.
Saturday's meeting will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won by more than 40 percent in that state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican nominee for West Virginia's Senate, but he's down in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey to know that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA show a willingness to keep hope alive for Sunday's individual competition
After three one-way rounds, the four-game Saturday afternoon could be just what was needed in this Ryder Cup race.
A swing in success is a sporting concept that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in a competition like this.
Where would they say that prosperity is now?
"They had a six-step lead and now it's four-step lead, so the success is more on our side now, I guess", said Jordan Spieth when he launched the race of the day.
Europe, of course, is ahead, four steps ahead, with 12 more to come.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in their sails and they can be a lot of noise, not least the likes of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, each scoring three out of four.
Spieth has played a very badly flawed game and leads by example.
The crowd rose as the circle progressed and he put down an important push to climb all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points down after two games.
His pitch, which secured them a victory in the 15th hole, was given a similar celebration party, a party of the kind that tells one that he believes the U.S. team still has a win.
"You just have to dig deep and think about your own game", Spieth said.
It's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to score points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legend of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but exciting European couple has won four games out of four and can't do anything wrong.
Moliwood were the only couple to get school on Saturday afternoon, but they also managed to avoid school on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and on the nine-hole course on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the large audience clearly shows that they are the pair that must win on Sunday, and there would be no favorite player to seal a possible victory for the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun setting over Le Golf National Stadium.
The best thing would be for both of you to do it at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson took Sergio Garcia, the quarterback, off lightly in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
Skolli and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never managed to clear.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four games are so exciting to watch closely because of the interactions between the couples, their advice, the advice they don't give, and how a game plan can change in one stroke.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead for the final, but this quarterfinal also showed that the American team has the fighting spirit that some doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after the quarter-finals and the quarter-finals on Saturday, with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Star Lake teams Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two victories over Tiger Woods, who was in difficulty, and four points at Le Golf National.
European side Thomas Bjorns, who is keen to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, showed a strong showing over the United States in the morning's quarter-final, winning 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games but failed to score.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the Cup going.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who shared the nickname Molliwood after a spectacular weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals, they showed great team consistency and won the final against Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance on one occasion, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the quarterfinals and four games, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was distracted by the morning's quarter-final, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the quarter-finals, and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - first and third on the list of world's best golfers.
Europe, however, did not benefit fully on this mild, busy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time golf champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record by two points on Saturday.
They narrowly defeated Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals, and later came back to defeat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quarterfinals after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won four stages since the start of an individual competition, although Fury's team needed only a draw to keep the Cup going.
After two days as the second-best, however, they seem to be overwhelmed by a Sunday attack.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament is possible without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continued trade restrictions only increase its distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for the country to unilaterally decommission its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken numerous measures to show goodwill over the past year, for example by halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear testing site, and promising to halt the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States, he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no guarantee of our country's security, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons first.
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to nuclear disarmament where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in that he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as explicitly as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to joint statements by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the incumbent US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, where Kim called for work on the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought solutions to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted accusations of easing its trade ties with North Korea.
"The United Nations demands that nuclear disarmament be put in place first and increases the pressure by using trade bans to achieve its goals, even protesting the declaration to end the war", Ri said.
It's just the dreams of people who know nothing about us who think that a business ban can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that continued trade restrictions are increasing our distrust.
Ri didn't mention any plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US president spoke to the US earlier this week.
Instead of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea over the past five months, the minister said: "If South Korea were the party to this nuclear disarmament issue instead of the United States, this would not be the patchwork in the disarmament issue in Korea's history".
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the mainland after the demonic President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
Last year, Trump threatened to turn North Korea back, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, saying that much work was still to be done and that trade bans would continue until North Korea had eliminated all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no clue what this was going to be about, and said, "Whether it's two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's trade ban must remain in place until complete nuclear disarmament has occurred and it has been confirmed".
The Security Council agreed to increase trade bans with North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to close funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile projects.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the SPC General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July and said he had succeeded, but just hours later, North Korea condemned him for making "forgettable demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to shut down missile sites and nuclear facilities if the United States intervenes in a similar manner.
He said Kim had told him that the "similar measures" he was looking for were assurances of Trump's promised security in Singapore and measures to restore normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes that are not enough
A new program at Harvard University has provided more sleep to all students in an attempt to counter the growing tendency of students to stay awake and study all night with caffeine.
A study found that students at the world's best universities often know little or nothing about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the program, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the class after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on the classroom.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and asked, 'Why am I being told this first now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep helps with academic achievement and sports performance and even contributes to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the school's director of health services, said that the university had decided to launch the program after finding that students were very sleepy over the week.
The course is one hour long and includes a number of practical activities.
One of the exhibits is a room in a home, where students pour coffee balls, window dishes, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how performance in sports can be impaired by lack of sleep, and the importance of a good sleep routine.
In the second part, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with helpful symbols then encourages the participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students under the same.
But we feel that they have a right to know this, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that covers those who stay up and study all night is still alive, he said, adding that modern technology and the filtered pressures on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
He said that ensuring that students get enough quality sleep should be a weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety - even to avoid gaining weight, since lack of sleep increases the brain's urge to eat so that the body is seething.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physics graduate from California, helped Professor Czeisler put together the course, but he served as one of the professor's choirs last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the class had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a class for all the students at the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master's students to complete a similar course before they start college.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm clock to remind them to go to bed and to wake them up, and to take into account the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, but it can confuse the body's internal clock and cause problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mark from Menga knocks down Gerrards men
The Rangers were still struggling on the field, the disbanded Stevens Gerrards team had to settle for a 1-0 loss to Livingston, following a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox were looking to secure their first outdoor win since their victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt gave Gerrards only their second loss in his 18 games as manager.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers seemed to lack all the inspiration and were never likely to recover.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston is up to third, and are only behind Hibernian in points.
The Rangers could be in further trouble after lineman Calum Spence had to be discharged from the hospital with a head injury after something was thrown into him from the guests' valve helmet.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
However, Holt kept the same Livi 11 setup that Hearts had reached last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teammates voted over the opponent.
The Rangers might have had more of the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it hit.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when the first transmission from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Alan McGregor's goal, but he shot past.
A long extra quest from Keaghan Jacobs ended with Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow shot him past the quarterback.
The Rangers regained control of the game, but seemed to live more in hope than faith in their game in the final quarter of the game.
Alfredo Morales felt that he should have been given a wide kick by the end of the quarter, when he and Steven Lawless were in school together, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the call of the Colombian.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half but Liam Kelly, a former Ibrox goalkeeper, didn't need much to defend the scoring from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although an opportunity from Livi at the 34th minute would have come despite the other team's superiority, no one can deny that they deserved it, though not just because of their perseverance.
The Rangers failed again to make any progress from Jacobs' long drive.
Scott Arfield did not object when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose to send to Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard hired him in the half and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly and the switch was effective almost simultaneously with the backer Morelos coming in, but Kelly broke fast and ran up to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to urge the guests to play the exact kind of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett each long-time host of the show on their own.
Holts' team could have increased their lead at the last minute, but McGregor was successful in denying Jacobs an opportunity before Lithgow ran off the field.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' longtime manager, wanted another side when he and Jacobs collapsed, but Thomson rejected it again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here's a page from our calendar Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and FRAM... this is the day that the futurist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for measuring radiation and that invention eventually led to a technique called the Geiger measure.
The Geiger scale has gained a firm foothold in the scientific world since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: What in the world is this?
Rogers: This is the Geiger meter, used to find radioactive material on a uranium table.
When you put this headset on, you can hear the effects of the radiation from the atoms in the rocks.
Evans: It's really breaking right now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new anti-cancer agent can teach the immune system to detect dangerous cells
A new anti-cancer agent can teach the immune system to detect and kill dangerous cells
The drug teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves removing immune cells from the patient and transforming them into a laboratory
Then they can see a protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and then inject it back into the patient.
The experimental drug has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the drug, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from a patient and transforming them into a laboratory so that they can detect a protein called HER2, found in many forms of cancer, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that the drug is highly effective.
HER2 causes various cancers to stop growing, including breast, ovarian, lung, and tremor and endometrial cancers, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, involving the removal of immune cells from patients known to attack cancer cells, has been successful in treating one type of white blood cell.
Kanye West gave a lengthy speech in support of Trump and carried a MAGA derby after appearing on the SNL television show.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was featured in the Saturday Night Live studio after a lengthy speech praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for President in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, where he performed the Make America Great concert, he spoke out against the Democrats for a long time and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've spoken to white people so many times who say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
If I was worried about racial hatred, I'd have been moved out of the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a joke where Hollywood star Matt Damon mocked Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault case.
Although Longy West was not broadcast, a video of her was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received poor reviews from the back because of his hair choice.
I was put in a single-sided backpack.
And they said unto me, Go not up into the field with this robe.
They put me in a coma!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole", he said, according to a report from the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the deep hole?" and said he'd put on his superhero mask because that means you can't put me to work.
Try the love.
His interview was met with a barrage of audience cheers at least twice, and the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, and one of the presenters told the newspaper: "There was a rock in the studio".
West had been invited to replace singer Arionna Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the chairwoman of the conservative TPUSA party, but she tweeted: "To one of the most courageous souls: Thank YOU for seeing the many things".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply being himself, and that's amazing.
But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) that I feel supports and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now the person previously known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change the name and footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and not to be forgotten is the musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones, criticizes the poisonous masculinity of the world
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent adventure series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has criticized the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such a role on screen often means that young boys feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something had gone wrong and wondered how to address the problem of male poisoning in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actress from The Crown, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had strong views on how to handle the matter.
Personally, I feel at the moment - what's wrong with manhood?
What have we taught men in their adulthood about the problems we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in male sexuality, due to the very male characters in television.
He continued: "What is involved and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be determined by a man?
I think that's one of the most important questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong with young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not be appearing in any other Crown Show after the season's finale next summer, saying he had been given plenty of walls and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in the remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a kidnapper.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
'I met my wife on these shows, so they somehow gave me my future family and my life after that,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow, whom Kit played in this Emmy Award-winning show.
The couple married in June 2018, in Lesliar's family's home country of Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected or affected by HIV.
Health officials say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections were caused by sexual activity, which is a change from what was previously the case.
Previously, the spread of HIV in some parts of China was due to the use of contaminated blood.
The number of people infected with HIV in this way has again fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people infected with or destroyed by HIV has increased by 100,000 people each year.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a lot of discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's conservative laws, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican Senators, criticizing dangerous lies and security scams.
Senator Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that one of her employees had posted the personal information of three Republican Senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these allegations came from "high-right-wing aging activists" and websites.
"Lies, lies and more egregious lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published contained the address and phone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown party on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for sexual assault.
The leak came sometime after the three Senators had heard from Kavanaugh.
More recent reports on the board of Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers that identified the data subject were linked to Waters' office and shared information about one of its employees, according to Capitol Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a pure lie", Waters continued.
My employee - whose personal data and security are now at risk because of these erroneous reasons - was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a pure lie.
Waters's announcement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, a former White House correspondent.
"This denial is full of rage", wrote Fleischer.
That suggests she has no chance of sitting in parliament.
When someone is accused of wrongdoing, do not react with anger.
It must not be resisted.
It is not permissible to question the motives of the accuser.
It must be calm and respectful.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said appeared to have been overly angry at Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee for the Midterm Election against Waters, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
Great case, if true, he was.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the injured are found", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all the actions that are shameful and dangerous to all my employees".
Film criticism for Johnny English Strikes Again - spy thriller starring Rowan Atkinson is proving to be a little bit of a power hit
It has become a habit of the modern day to look for references to Brexit in all new films in which Britain has made history, and it seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this quiz satirise how obviously infamous we are as a new export device for the country?
Whether that is true or not, the outlandish, grumpy, and clawed Johnny English has been given a renewed license for a second time to scratch everything - his name goes beyond the fact that he is a work of art designed for display in other English-speaking countries.
He's obviously the clever secret agent who seems to live through the horrors of character, but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, a dance by Mr. Bean, and a little bit of a slash by the man who played a one-note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the traveler and mysterious citizen of the world that Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, where he explained everything to himself in a disarray.
There's one or two good scenes in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English walk on a helicopter dressed in a medieval robe and the helicopter leaves rolling into his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his grey talent, but the humor seems rather powerless and oddly superficial, especially now that more serious films like James Bond and the Mission Impossible films also offer a sense of humor.
The joke seems more to be aimed at children than adults, and I found the adventure Johnny English ended up in not as thoughtful and focused as Atkinsons silent jokes in Mr. Beans's show.
The film's eternal premise now is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into Britain's secret spy network and uncover the identities of all British spies, much to the dismay of the spy on duty - but unfortunately Kevin Eldon is playing too small a role.
This is the final moment for the arrogant and controversial Prime Minister who is already in great danger from the enormous political unrest: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her role as a character to remember Theresu May, but the script is not up to many fish for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already been seated in the holy stone.
And that's where Johnny English himself comes into the story, now principal of some fine school, but also secretly teaches how to be a spy: here are some funny thugs English offers a spy school that reminds me of the movie School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets Bough, his long-tired ex-partner, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife a submarine captain, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine is not quite ready to let her light shine.
The Ionian Sea, which consumes everything in her majestic service, is now back in the game and meets the master Opheliu Bulletovu, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is haunted by the magic of the fascinating billionaire within the tech giant, who claims to be able to solve the UK's computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crackdown: they light up a nice French restaurant with a steak serving, they take a nap while smuggling into the luxury Volta chain, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use a virtual camera to introduce himself to the interior of the Volta house.
There is nothing to spare in the final scene, but although the film is forty and energetic, it still contains some of the baby matter in its entirety.
It's a medium-sized material.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: can the British film industry let Rowan Atkinson get a role that really matches his talents?
The Labour Party denies that it is creating a four-day workweek plan for the British, with the same pay as five days a week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now proposing a radical plan that would allow British workers to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants to use the savings generated by the artificial revolution for business leaders and to allow employees to benefit by taking one extra day off.
Then workers could enjoy three days of long weekends without losing their wages.
According to sources, the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and its policy of improving the welfare of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has endorsed a four-day extension of the working week, as a way for workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
The change will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is a goal that fits the party's approach to transforming the economy for the benefit of the working class and the party's overall policy.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day workweek in its 2017 election campaign.
The aim, however, is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not on the party's policy sheet and the party is not considering introducing it".
John McDonnell, the shadow trade secretary, used the Labour Party's meeting last week to express his ideas about social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from unknown executives and harvest collectors of the food industry.
The Shadow Cabinet's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back as the Labour government could default on a 'default' due to alleged wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate boards and create a joint ownership fund to give 10 percent of private company assets to their employees, who could receive £500 of them annually in the pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say 60 minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could get them to change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week-long debate on the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether its findings could get Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter for the 60 Minutes Republican and Senate members John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleagues.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, and unambiguous.
Graham's vote, however, seems unchanged.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible excuse to change that", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this I do know: Brett firmly denied it, Graham added, and accused Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone she names could confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new going to change.
What is the international city festival, and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City on Saturday, an annual music event that will feature a series of celebrities and a similarly influential strategy; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Urban Festival, and tens of thousands of people will be moving to Central Park, not only to listen to musicals from Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The International Urban Day, first celebrated in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, but there are international campaigns that aim to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to complete various tasks, or activities, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or using other valid means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now that 12 years have passed since the goal was reached?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free music really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just a so-called "smart trick" -- where people feel they're doing something meaningful by signing up for a list of online demands or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that as of 2011, it has registered over 19 million actions from its supporters to call for a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to get world leaders to articulate commitments and policies that amount to over $35 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group recorded 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its activities, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide to date.
One major commitment comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investment and executive organisation that works to help children enjoy their full potential, and has pledged to donate 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end child labour in the country, after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can make the social injustices of malnutrition a thing of the past", Tracey Ullmann, representing The Power of Nutrition, told a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 petitions were sent to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the group's website, one of the most frequently asked questions is: Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?
Global citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and difficult task - sometimes we're going to fail for a long time.
But we will reach our limits, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because we are stronger together.
This year's event features Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe, and will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a deterrent to block Russia's energy exports, Interior Minister says
If necessary,Washington could use its navy to prevent Russia from reaching markets, including the Middle East, says Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of State, according to a report by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russian aid to Syria, especially as the country works under the legitimacy of the government there, would be a good idea to explore new markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to do energy trade like in Eastern Europe and its southern regions", he said, according to sources.
And, according to a press release, there are ways and means to track it down.
"Countries can use the navy to ensure that sea lanes are open and to create barriers, if necessary, to ensure that energy from them does not enter the market", he said.
Zinke called for a meeting hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group calling itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it's more or less the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is increasingly less energy use and energy swapping", he said, adding that Russia has only one player in the game with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The announcements come as the Trump administration seeks to increase its natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to withdraw from the unsuccessful Nord Stream 2 project to install a new power pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, which will double the current pipeline's transport cost to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely economic.
The Russians say Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose between stocks", Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to abandon the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very disgusted that foreign states are replacing our energy networks", said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, she says.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider running for mayor at Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and sing for our government, and then we also need a woman as leader", she said, according to a report from The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for President.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been uncomfortable with his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court justice.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that "Of course we have to have the FBI investigate this before the vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren County voters do not feel she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the most likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent reported supporting her campaign.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's campaign, with 38 percent saying they supported his potential campaign and 48 percent saying they were against it.
Other popular Democrats who were considered for a possible 2020 presidential nomination included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he plans to make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about the impact of the Track Palin campaign at the election of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, served in Iraq for a year after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"My son is going through a lot of hardship after coming back, I'm with other families who are feeling the effects of the strike resolution and the emotional trauma that our soldiers are coming home with", she told a crowd at the Donald Trump election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room", saying that her son and other war veterans "come back a little different, they are hardened, and they wonder if any respect is paid for what their comrades in the army and air force and other branches of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempted to prevent reporting of domestic violence, and assault with a deadly weapon while under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support the challenge of a new health care policy
Eighteen states and Washington, D.C., support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies victims of domestic or domestic violence fleeing their homes.
Representatives from 18 states and the city filed a court report Friday in Washington to support a shelter leader who opposes the policy, according to a NBC News report.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal government has not been released.
She said that her husband and his violent sons, who were gang members, had abused her, but U.S. officials dropped her application for parole on July 20.
She was taken into custody in Texas.
The plaintiffs, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where trafficking and domestic violence are on the rise.
The new asylum policy reverses a ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Washington's attorney general, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has been hampered by decades of state, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that decisions on all asylum applications be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule", the court said in the report.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy of excluding immigrants from entry was detrimental to the U.S. economy, arguing that immigrants were more likely to start businesses and to "take on a vital workforce".
State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration courts to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Those who leave their home countries because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum", Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Health care was never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in the race to find survivors in Palu, the death toll is doubling
Survivors will find their situation even more difficult.
"There is a lot of tension in the air", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, when she comforted her infirm son at the relief center in the city of Palu.
Ambulance trucks are bringing bodies here for a while.
There is little clean water.
The inhabitants of the Saw return to their devastated homes and search their waterfalls to try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, lay outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were being evacuated due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how he felt the earthquake hit his fifth-floor hotel room, where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushing up the walls, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town to go to the wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "conducting war crimes"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four recent ads in U.S. newspapers discussing mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread the propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last spoke on Wednesday about an advert for the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's claim that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. election market was what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to use Chinese pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in a continuing trade war, with new tariffs on imported goods imposed on the nations.
Chinese and American experts say that China's vengeful dollars early in the trade war were designed to hurt expats in states such as Iowa, which pushed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, but that state ships a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In his review of the Des Moines Register Sunday, Branstad said that "China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda in our own free media".
"To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's beloved freedom of speech and our free press by advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said in his article.
"On the contrary, there are few protests in the newspaper stalls on the streets of Beijing, and there is no true reflection of the differences of opinion that Chinese people might have about China's worrying economic policy, where the media are locked under the umbrella of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's largest newspapers had been denied the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention what it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making women voters vote for them in the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Justice, who has laid down the allegations of sexual harassment.
There's been a lot of intense sentiment around this issue, and most Republicans have already publicly expressed their desire to start voting.
"You can't mess with these things", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the last-minute appeal of the FBI investigation by Republican Senator Jeff Flake to the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a consultant and spokeswoman for the liberal movement MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. News.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is Coming!" in the streets of the Senate when the Republican-led decision-making committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The passion and grandmother of the electorate will be gone from all power", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
People will say that there was already a lot of interest, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president, but rarely vote.
Investigators predicted a backlash if Republicans pressured Kavanaugh to confirm, even before Ford's testimony in which she expressed her accusations of sexual harassment from him.
"This has become a big cloud for the Republican Party", said Michael Still, a former Republican National Committee member, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final ballot or whether Kavanaugh will be allowed to sit on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps vote Democrats, told the news station.
However, Americans seem to disagree on who to believe on the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the vast majority support the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believed or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or likely believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh likely or surely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's appeal, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to a Guardian report.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, saying Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 and that he was under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh wore her sex toy in front of her when they were both at a Yale University party in the '90s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to launch a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, is going to start a startup company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology company, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Open Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world-wide".
"We have to do this now", he said of the seed company.
This is a historic moment.
The software uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own online store of personal data, or POD.
It may include a list of contacts, a list of schedules, a calendar, a music museum, and other personal and work-related devices.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all in one place, all at the same time.
The unique feature of the Personal Data Store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "personal violence by using data".
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the tools, processes and relevant knowledge to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company is Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security firm that was acquired by IBM, several programmers who were hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of nonprofit programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team should not be talking to Facebook and Google about whether a radical change should be initiated that would put their current business model on their minds overnight.
We're not asking for permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday on Medium that Inrupt's goal was to create energy in business and ecosystems that help protect the integrity and quality of the new website that is built on Solid.
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even as he launches Inrupt.
"I'm fully optimistic about the next season of the network", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victorian priest and executor of the First World War
The only English priest to be honoured with the Victoria Cross in World War I as a soldier has been honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Sergeant Bernard Vann, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the army, was awarded the Cross on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a secret shell and never learned that he had been awarded the highest honor of the British Army.
Two of his cousins unveiled memorabilia of him on a cruise in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandparents, Michael Vann, said that it was a marvelous symbolic event that the memorial was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's sacrifice.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his sub-lieutenant through the Canal de Saint-Quentin through a thick siege and under heavy fire from parachutes and machine guns.
Later, he ran to the line of fire and, with great courage, led the line before attacking a paratrooper of his own and overwhelming three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended, Vann was killed by a German secret shell.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I could never do, but something that makes a man humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the wreath after the abortion, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be involved in the abortion movement", adding that "the true heroes are shown by the support so many people show".
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead getting to see gray pigs
Just imagine, having been up all night watching the crowded Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The schedule included 13 days of fighting from San Jose, including six on the main schedule, and were broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, the British audience received an unexpected surprise when the show changed to Grey Pig.
Some were displeased after being up all night watching the battle.
One Twitter fan described the changes to the diet as "a kind of disease-causing".
"Under official rules, the substance was not suitable for audiences at 6 a.m. so they had to switch to children's", said Dave Schwartz, deputy director of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked to comment on the broadcast.
Good pork, yeah.
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said they would revisit their timetables and include UK audiences in the future.
'I think when I think about the review that we could probably get rid of this,' said Coker.
But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning there, and we can't get out of this until Sunday, our time, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was switched, there were a lot of text messages sent back and forth, and not all of them were favorable.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limited the evening to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too hard and we went out of our way.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was discouraged by his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have experienced a growing dislike for other people because of his sexuality, but that it has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn't realize he was different until he went to an art school.
On the Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he was talking about gay rights to give others  hope.
He also said that the role of a parent had diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host, has taken a few months off because of illness.
Daley met Laverne abroad on the first episode, and said that he felt he was "the least of the men" he had ever seen as a child because "it was not accepted in society to be liked by both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference have given me the strength and the power to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when his sexuality finally came up.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has made a significant contribution as an LGBT advocate, using her participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he wanted to be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said age difference would never have been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age - but you made your first Olympic appearance at age 14 and your father died of cancer three years later - you said it was hard to find anyone your age who had experienced the same success and hardship.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his life expectancy had been reduced.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son is baptized in the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father hadn't settled for his death and one of the last things he had asked was if they were ready to get their centers for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until his breathing stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dive in front of an Olympic stadium audience.
It was also the inspiration for the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - that had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him a good skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15am local time.
Mickelson in poor form and dead sitting on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a home run on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to find his old pace so the home run isn't surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th tournament, was left in the classroom after frontman Jim Furyk's decision for Saturday's quarterfinals and quarterfinals.
Instead of being the center of the gamble, as has been so often the case in the United States, the five-time champion's day alternates between being a fiddler and practicing the toys on the field in the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Mickelson, 48, was never the one to shoot a shoulder with a drill, and is not the best player for Le Golf National golf course, where long balls are often punished for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in Game Nine on Sunday. Molinari is with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below, take the first of 12 singles, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could change the world.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
"He understood the role he had today perfectly, slapped me on the back, and took me outside and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's been so much of a hitter for the teams before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it ended and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been as high as any other record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence would have had a definite undisclosed impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's cold, he's hot, he likes to make fun of people, and it's great to have him in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed challenging him this week too, and it was fun to watch.
He gives so much more than just the game of golf.
Thomas Bjorn, the European Union's president, knows that much of the excess can quickly disappear.
European forward Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup individual race can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
Daninn made his debut in a Valderrama game in 1997, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but managed to claim victory in the final with the lowest possible score, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 wins.
"People remember that we had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Brookline where we lost and at Valderrama where we won, but just like that", said Bjorn, who is pictured here, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and reaching a 10-6 mark at Le Golf National.
History will show me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
We'll all be out tomorrow.
Let's go and do it right.
This isn't over until all the steps are on the table.
We have our goal and that's trying to win this cup, we're focused on that.
I've always said this, I'm focused on the 12 players on our team, but we're very aware of our mothers on the other team -- the best golfers in the world.
Bjorn was pleased with the way his players had faced the hard times, adding: "I will never outdo myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, it's the performance of the individual that matters, and that's another thing.
It's great to play with a team when everything is going well, but when you play alone, you're testing everyone's golfing skills.
Those are the messages that need to be sent to the players, to get the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to play his best game himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his mentor, Jim Furyk, will strive to make his players perform better in individual games rather than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big trade on the last day, but he was victorious with his team at Brookline but ended up losing when Europe built the 'Medinah power plant.'
"I remember every fucking word", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 forward, had encouraged his players to continue on the last day.
We have 12 big games to play tomorrow, but you want to start fast like you did at Brookline and Medina.
When the scratch is close to building up, there is a lot of pressure on the game being played.
We rank our players accordingly and let them play as we feel they will do best tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defence and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the remaining European players in the first half of the game.
"I chose these players in this order because I think they cover the whole process", Bjorn said of his selection of players in the individual tournament.
New German Navy postponed again
The newest German Navy vessel was supposed to be built in 2014 to replace old Cold War war ships, but it will not be ready until next year, due to poor systems and rising costs, local reports said.
Construction of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a Navy spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit.
The ship was scheduled to be commissioned by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivery delayed the project.
The Baden-Wuerttemberg-class four ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen-class ships, which have reached their age.
They must be equipped with more powerful parachutes, multiple air defense and naval firefighting aircraft, and on-board field equipment with reduced riding noise, and sound signals.
Other important features include longer service life - the latest ships should be able to be used for up to two years away from their home.
However, steady delays mean that these new-generation warships - which are said to enable Germany to show its strength - will be obsolete when finally put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The F125 was in the news last year when the German army publicly refused to accept the flight and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the flag, but German media reported that many women were seriously ill with software and hardware, rendering the ship useless if sent into service.
The software was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be manned by 120 crew members, half the size of the Bremen class.
It also revealed that the ship was becoming too heavy, which diminished its performance and limited the Navy's ability to make future repairs.
The 7,000-tonne ships of the Rheinland-Pfalz class are said to be twice the weight of similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the hardware shortcomings, the cost of the entire project - including training the seafarers - has begun to cause problems.
It is estimated to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but was originally set at €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the new ships are particularly important given the warnings that German overseas operations are declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the navy was actually becoming a "complex ship".
The representative said that the problem had been solved over time, since older ships had been decommissioned but no ships had replaced them.
He condemned the fact that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the navy.
The National Trust Conservation Corps is spying on the secret life of leatherback
A new study, conducted in the countryside of the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how leather beetles use the countryside when they hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these monotonous flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, led by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow different types of leather blocks in the Inverewe Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations in the region to monitor the leather patches over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be on handheld sensory surveillance tours.
Experts will scan all the recordings to find out the frequency of calls the leather blocks are making and what types do what.
Residential maps and reports will then be published to provide a precise picture of their behaviour on a geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS's nightlife management consultant, hopes the findings will reveal what types of habitats are most important for the leather blocks and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the cost of habitat management, such as by creating a forest and how best to maintain forestland for leather blocks and other related species.
In the last century, leather has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect their livelihoods and reduce habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose risks, including flying papers and certain chemical reactions to building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Leather blocks are not actually blind.
However, they are more likely to benefit from hearing than from watching when fishing, for they are accustomed to fishing at night.
They use advanced mountain surveying techniques to locate insects and objects in their flight paths.
NTS, which maintains over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes leather blocks very seriously.
Ten specialists work in these organizations, who regularly conduct inspections, evaluations, and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even established Scotland's first and only leather-blooded republic at Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten leather-blooded species in Scotland have their homes.
David Thompson, the farm's supervisor, says he's the perfect area for them.
"The area here at Threave is great for leather blocks", he said.
We have old buildings, plenty of mature trees and plenty of good habitats.
But there is still much unknown about leather blocks, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to be cleaned.
He stressed the importance of checking with leather blocks before maintenance is carried out in warehouses, as possible accidental destruction of a single hair can kill up to 400 female leather blocks and young and deformed all leather blocks in the area.
Leather blocks are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harm or disturb them, or destroy their hair.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about leather straps, and we don't know how many straps are doing well.
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations. Lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations against him of rape "fake news" and says that people want to draw attention to him by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 left over for keeping quiet about the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, told his 142-million followers in an Instagram Live video that they were "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What was said today is fake news, the world champion told the camera five times.
These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's only natural.
It's like being famous by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldos' lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "illegal publication of suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would be fined the same amount as the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.
This alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the wrist, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the unfortunate incident and told her that he was a 99 percent good man who fell into temptation because of the 1 percent.
The document states that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that it was with the consent of both parties.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had her effects photographed in the hospital, but eventually accepted an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared to death by retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
She says she wants to quit the series now because she's still in a coma after a serious incident.
Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giant Juve for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: Britain would see itself forever losing carmakers
Britain would see this forever if it lost its position as a global leader among carmakers after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Trade Greg Clark.
He added that it was alarming that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cease production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a border disaster if a no-deal Brexit were to be real would cost jobs.
Burnaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see manufacturing facilities in our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other British automakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how international trade should proceed, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns lie in what carmakers say is a major risk if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
Toyota's production line is based on last minute acceptance, with parts delivered every 37 minutes from both UK and EU stockpiles for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions to the border that the industry believes could lead to fuel shortages and shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's worth of goods at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that the Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future of the EU was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border.
'We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us to not only enjoy success in the modern world, but also as an opportunity to take advantage of,' he told BBC Radio 4's show.
Reviews, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, show that we must be able to continue with highly effective approaches.
Toyota could not say how long their production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year-old Burnaston worker and union trustee at the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: "My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for the future of our relationship with the EU.
The Trump-Rosenstein dispute could be rescheduled, according to the White House.
The White House said on Sunday that a key meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein could be rescheduled for a week, as the dispute over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Roberts Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian election fraud, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstacles to the advancement of justice at the hands of the president.
For weeks, there have been rumors in Washington that Trump will fire a deputy prosecutor, putting Mueller's independence at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of expelling the president from the session using Article 25 of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But on Monday, he visited the White House, among news that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, but he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed so that he would not be present at the same time as the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have been accused of sexually assaulting him, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate vote further.
Sarah Sander, Trump's media representative, was on the Fox News Sunday show.
When asked to meet with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet set for him, it could be this week.
But we do, and I always enjoy informing the media.
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The team manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the small number of meetings was not due to dissatisfaction with the fact that TV reporters were "showers", but she said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they are showers".
She then gave indications that direct ties between Trump and the media would increase.
The president answers more media questions than any other president has done before, she said, without citing sources: We have reviewed these figures.
Media meetings will still be held, Sanders said, but if the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of the media when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president perhaps showed the reason for this in New York this week, when he showed himself in a timely and unusual manner in front of a group of reporters.
EU health minister writes to healthcare workers in Scotland about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working within the NHS Scotland to express their gratitude and wish that it will continue to work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to cover the costs of applying for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, talks between the UK and the EU have continued due to the lack of progress, and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The British government has also been working on preparations for a possible non-deal.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
So I want to reiterate how much I value the work of all employees, regardless of nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and knowledge that enhances and improves the work of healthcare and benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we would like you to stay here for a while.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a stroke
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a report by Tennessean reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the impact had occurred shortly before the half.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there", Reed said.
The coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a baby and taken out for closer inspection.
A representative from Tennessee State, Chris Harris, a WSMV radio host in Nashville, Tenn., said that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was still little information on the nature or severity of the impact and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in his senior year, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had five devices in total on Saturday before he left, which increased his total number of devices to 18.
Foreign buyers are charged higher flat rates when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher flat rates when they buy real estate in the UK.
The measure will make no impact on Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased voting fees will be charged to non-payers of UK taxes
The National Trust estimates that it will raise £120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher flat rates when they buy real estate in the UK.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promoting affordable housing and taxing celebrities more.
Individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher tuition fees, and the government will be involved in the government's efforts to help the homeless.
The increase - in addition to the current tuition fees, including the two-year increase in extra housing and rented real estate - could be as high as three percent.
The State Fund estimates that the increase will generate up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new homes in London are bought by foreigners, but this causes the price to rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to enter the market.
Many of the country's more developed areas - especially the capital - have become "dirty cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in voting fees to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix the UK housing shortage.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of significant housing reforms, including the rental authority and the end of the rental-free exit.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first term -- that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our unused real estate market.
The gates of Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work here and build their lives.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for foreigners and companies with headquarters abroad to buy homes as it is for skilled British nationals.
For many, the dream of having their own home has become far too distant, and the plight of homelessness is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to train Scotland".
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland, says that his biggest goal is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish now uses the challenge to breathe new life into the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points from the top flight.
He moved to Sunderland for the summer after returning to St Mirren in the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I injured my knee and it was over,' Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland often in Hampden with my dad as a child, and there's always something that has pulled me back.
But that chance would only be given if I manage to coach the league.
Ross' former coaches at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such big names, but he had previously turned down coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
And I'll measure my success by thinking: Can I get this club back into the big leagues?
This club has a double-edged home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities, he said.
It's not an easy job to get him there, but I'd probably just look at myself as a success here if I got the club back up there.
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-tier relegation, and turned St Mirren, who was about to drop out of the league, into the league champion the following season.
Ross claims to be more self-assured now than he was at one point in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real time match", he says of his time as Alloa's coach.
"I really believed that coaching was good for me, even more so than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, I had a decent income and enjoyed great success.
But change can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through it when it comes to stress and work pressure, but coaching just seems right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do, I've never felt better about myself in all my adult years.

The best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a poll.
The heat wave this summer has proved uncomfortable for the British bar owner Basel, but the pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Room rates for infants and children increased by 2.7 percent in July, while room rates for restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and England's unexpected World Cup success meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when bargains rose by 2.8 percent, except for even lower sales in restaurants.
Sales fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, which focused primarily on the sale of alcohol, stood for the longest time with more traffic as restaurants went down.
Food vending stalls also had trouble getting sunny, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
The number of drinks in infants and children increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while the number of meals decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, of analytics firm RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the fluctuations we've seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of major social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to out-of-home sales.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups still struggle, although monthly sales of 4.8 percent are particularly painful above the continued pressure of cost.
This long, hot summer could hardly have come at a worse time for food markets, and only time will tell whether temperate temperatures, such as those we have had in August, will improve the situation.
The overall growth in pub and restaurant sales, including newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the availability of openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK's leading bar and restaurant tracker, collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is the industry leader for the gears.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children under the age of 11 has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the number of Insta sites
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students report having only one account they show their parents
One in five children under the age of 11 creates a secret social media account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in Insta's accounts - a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of the students reported having a pure "close" account to show their parents, as well as having secret accounts.
A mother who came across a secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to rape me.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: "It is a concern that so many teenagers are trying to create an online community where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletics Committee.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful female freestyle athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
Eilidh enjoys great respect within the sporting community in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are confident that sport in Scotland would make a lot of money by getting it on the committee,' said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope to contribute to the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now a regular guest on the BBC, was paralyzed after suffering a brief bout of blood clots.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I recovered and how much.
It has been a hard job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and did some exercise today!
Thank you for your encouragement!
Breast pump advertising, which puts women in a cage with cows, causes online dispute
Breast pump companies are now being talked about online because of advertisements that sell dairy cows to dairy cows.
Elvie has released a promotional ad to promote what is said to be the world's first portable loud-speak breast pump. The ad is inspired by music videos and aims to show the freedom that the new pump brings to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dancing in a tune full of hay and cuddling with a song on the table: "Yes, I'm breastfeeding, but you don't see a tail on me, and if you can't get it, then this isn't a yeast, it's my breast".
The link goes on: Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the juices.
However, the ad, which appears on the company's Facebook page, has generated online conversation.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received negative reviews from viewers, many of whom say it was inspired by the "craziness" that accompanies the dairy industry.
Really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become calves and carry on producing milk, except for what the calves are taken from them just days after they are born, ' one comment said.
Elvie's breast pump fits comfortably in a breast-growing device (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: "It's quite difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are going to have to keep their babies?
Another added: "This ad is completely out of date.
Others came to the advertisement for protection, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "crazy".
I think this is a big idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby on my chest.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant piece, wrote one of the audience.
Another said: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like a 'goat.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the ad, the group of women show that they were all dancing with their breast pumps falling into their breast glands.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is that many women say they feel like a cow when they pump milk out.
However, the Elvie pump is quite noisy, has no wires or leads, and fits comfortably above the breastplate, giving women freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go outside while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and chief executive of Mother, said: "Elvie's pump is so revolutionary that she deserved a remarkable introduction that would spark conversation.
By likening women to cows, we wanted to direct the light to the breast pump and all its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two children showed up for a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to tents on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has increased abruptly even though the number of children crossing the border monthly has remained somewhat the same. Part of the reason is that the Trump administration's harsh policies have made it harder to get the children into a temporary conception.
Usually, the foster parents have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear risking their chances of remaining in the country by offering to adopt a child.
The threat increased in June when authorities announced that prospective foster parents and other adults inside the home would submit fingerprinting and that the data would be shared with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the Senate, saying his organization had arrested a number of people who applied to adopt single children.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on record.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in foster homes are in the country illegally, and many of them are illegal immigrants on record.
'We are continuing to search for those individuals,' said Mr Albence.
In an effort to speed up the handling of children's cases, representatives announced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, according to the former policy, according to the crime scene staff.
Many of them will appear via video rather than in person to argue their legal standing before immigration judges.
Children who are deemed unfit to enter the country are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent tendencies or the temptation to flee, according to the staff of the program and reports published by the system in recent months.
Spokesmen said that these problems were even more likely in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that even children have difficulties because of the number.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could add to the attacks many of them are already experiencing.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish military to withdraw as soon as possible
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech to the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the country is now in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syria, under the false premise that they were fighting terrorism, and that they would be treated accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told parliament.
Moualem therefore insisted that the war on terrorism was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this weekend until we clear all Syrian areas of both terrorist groups and all illegal foreign entities.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return, and he instructed some Western countries to spread unfounded fear that encouraged refugees to stay away.
'We have called on the international community and humanities to facilitate their return,' he said.
They create politics out of something that should be purely human.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone at the last major border crossing has opened up opportunities for further political talks.
The treaty between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had a definite deadline and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is affiliated with Al-Qaeda, and that they would be eliminated.
Staffan de Mistura, the ambassador of the SDF, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition, to negotiate a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to transgressing existing government provisions, and warned against any attacks.
The reason Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless impeachment and impeachment end his presidency, as many liberal viewers likely expect.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of a presidential career ever!
As is the case with the audience, there is no sign of the triangle.
Since 2014, the best-of-season viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked at 3.5 million viewers on key news nights.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to, because this is something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a government official who becomes president after the House of Commons is attacked.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned novelist and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another excuse.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The bus driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, 'Because he comes to make me laugh,' said Miss Scovell to me.
There's entertainment in the riot.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the global economy.
Only those viewers who enjoy the highest privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than just being an informed citizen when you look at the sixth season of a panel of experts who use Bob Woodwards's far closer  documentary for his book Fear, or the $15,000 jacket of street leather worn by Paul Manafort (a modestly bred, said the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' detailed biographical description of Mr. Trump.
I'll never look Super Mario in the same eyes again.
"Part of what makes a good person feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "Pawn Stars", while discussing the staffing of Trump's show and the daily changes in the story (such as starting a fight with the NFL and a parade in Kim Jong-Un's park).
You can't lose one thing, or you lose the thread.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, it was a 26 degree heat and sun outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holding himself in and watching MSNB while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought this was some kind of scam, but it turned out that people were right.

Money flows out in the most recent midterm elections
No wonder the 17th Pennsylvania district is seeing a surge in money, thanks to a reorganization of the constituencies that has led to two representatives running for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the second district in a special election last summer.
Lamb is running for another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which is heavily tied to the new 17th District.
The map of the constituencies was reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old constituencies were organized in favor of the Republicans and that it was unconstitutional.
The launch of the new 17th constituency has been the start of a campaign finance competition between the major funders of both parties, the Democratic and Republican Committees for the Election (DCCC) and the Republican Committees for the Election (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a few victories in a special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, but many followed those elections.
Republicans had held that seat for more than a decade before, and President Donald Trump won the election by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little boost.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for its support of China, but then withdrew.
The government officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a brief meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a Panama hotel until the Trump administration team's co-owners raided the compound.
State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over a recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan, Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States in 2017 for aid work, including drug control, development work and economic support.
The penalties, which included cutting back on financial support and restricting residence permits, would have been painful for Central America, where unemployment is high and murder rates are high.
As the internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American delegates postponed the Security and Economic Prosperity Conference, which was to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, representatives from the upper class made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending all sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now hosting the conference, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October, a sign of its importance to the board, the recollection said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic in a hushed voice, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to discuss the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two special representatives, who agreed to discuss the internal voice of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside reporter who works closely with the administration and also spoke on the case against anonymity.

The next major shock could be Special Counsel Roberts Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible actions to obstruct justice, but there is a wealth of public evidence to support that claim.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also investigating whether Mr. Trump's election campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress is ruled by another party, Trump could be held accountable for that, as he prepares to meet his constituents again, and perhaps a jury appointed by his peers.
But these are very unknown, and I don't want to imply that Trump's fall is undeniable, nor the fall of his European counterpart.
We all have to make choices, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler, only if Western countries had given him the backing and support of the Czechoslovak forces in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the disaster that followed.
History revolves around such important points and the speed or the tide of the unstable progress of democracy.
The American people are facing some of these important issues right now.
What if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the man who is in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this paper reported that last year he had proposed making secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was unfit to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is not true.
What will we do if the newly launched FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or factual, or if he is confirmed to the bench despite religious allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we elect a midterm congress that will leave Mr. Trump shoulder to shoulder?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to spend a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had previously served in my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath gardens on the table with the cross.
With such a legacy, how can I look forward to our future with a positive outlook?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to be relegated from the Europa League's G Group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season before the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use the results that jumped to a better result.
"It was good to get this score for us, because Villarreal is a strong team", said Dorrans, 31.
We started the game believing we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Maybe we could have claimed victory in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got stronger in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the Europa League.
Hopefully we can get to three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did well in their last game, but with the support of the audience, I'm sure we'll endure this and get a positive result.
The last year was a difficult one, both because of the fewer injuries and the changes that took place at the club itself, but now there is a good feeling at the venue.
The team's good, the boys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last game behind us and achieve success.
Women lose sleep for fear of losing their retirement savings
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported talking about this with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of it, but it's not the right thing to do to have those conversations", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance division.
That's how it should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot provide for your family if you do not give them clear instructions.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and when you can receive care, as these options can greatly change the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to cover the costs.
The options you have to pay for long-term care include traditional long-term care life insurance, mixed-life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay for expenses, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get a health care provider so you can appoint someone you trust to take care of your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals will follow your wishes if you cannot say them directly yourself.
Consider also getting a proof holder for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Remember the details: Imagine that an elderly parent is in an emergency and on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Please include the information in a written schedule so that you are ready.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are", Martin said.
Who's the medicine?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have a plan ready.
A man shot multiple times by a machine gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by a machine gun while walking home after having a good time.
The victim, a man in his 50s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the cornstarch and the hand.
Officials describe the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. local time, as a "hand-held attack".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The man was not seriously injured and police have called witnesses.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and flood in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As all communications are down, emergency services have been unable to provide any information from Donggala district, a region north of Palu near the center of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were left homeless in Palu after the unfortunate outbreak.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, is located at the bottom of a narrow river on the western coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and flood struck.
Donggala is a province that covers more than 380 km of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, an administrative subdivision of the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main industries in Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nuclear power plants are also important in the province, but they are mostly in Morowali, on the coast of Sulawesi.
Flooding has affected Palu and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian Maritime Organization.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a flood and hundreds of homes in Donggala were destroyed.
Also, in 1996, flooding in western Donggala killed nine people.
Indonesia sits on the other side of the Pacific, where earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are the most significant earthquakes and floods in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra raged on December 26, triggering a flood that swept through 14 countries, killing 226,000 people worldwide along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds are dying on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Joppa, Indonesia's most populous island, causing flooding along the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter Range struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, and caused up to 10 meters high flooding that destroyed many villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A major earthquake devastated Pidie Jaya province in Aceh, causing devastation and terror, people remembered the devastation of the devastating earthquake and flood of 2004.
No flooding occurred this time, but over 100 people died as buildings collapsed.
2018: A major earthquake hits the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Hundreds of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Senior son of Soru Palin arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Soer Palin, former governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to prevent a report of domestic violence, and for resisting arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police, published Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report a meaningful interruption.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Station, where he is awaiting trial, and is being held on $500 bail, according to a KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself innocent, innocent when asked to declare guilty or innocent, according to the news agency.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under review by the Alaska Department of Corrections.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and carrying a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he kissed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of militant instigators in 2016 after she lectured on the violent behavior of her son after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Flood in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people died in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered flooding and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the center of Sulawesi Island, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing the incident are now on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the storm hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected participant in a terrorist attack in New York City that left eight people dead.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have hired a Home Depot truck to attack people on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and bicyclists in October.
To justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs must prove that Saipov deliberately killed the eight victims and caused serious bodily harm, according to the will to use the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District Court of New York.
Both of these charges could lead to the possible death penalty, according to court records.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal court indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for criminal purposes, which is usually used by prosecutors in organized crime charges.
The attack involved a number of deliberate plots, prosecutors said, describing Sapiov's actions as "terrible, brutal, and immoral".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was selected for personal injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, the will states.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the southern district of New York last used the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was carried out in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed two years earlier after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The couple were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He told the investigator that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had gotten the idea for the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were obviously disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the impact of this incident on all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations on Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the People's Army today at a protest at the Conservative convention.
This former EU leader said politicians would be facing pressure from doubters about the EU, while one of the MPs, Theresu May, suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that Britain would be leaving now if Mr Farage were the Brexit leader.
But the challenge for May to resolve the deep dispute between her own teammates was even more apparent when conservatives who want to stay in the EU joined other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep Chequers' plan on track and is facing criticism from Brexit-defying, anti-Brexit and the EU.
Allies claimed that it would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and urged those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between its plan and its "rebellion".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been involved and shouldered responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he was with the governor, we'd be out now, he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan".
He explained his opposition to the EU by saying: "We do not fight world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone cited indications that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British public has changed their minds and wants to stand still is completely false".
Andrea Jenkyns, a staunch Brexit supporter, was also on the protest march, telling reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers' plan is unpopular with the public, and the opposition will not vote for it, but it is taking advantage of the unpopularity among our party members and activists who are out on the streets voting for us.
Do it, stop the Chequers program and start listening.
In a direct message to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said politicians would be subject to pressure if they were to back down from the decision taken after the 2016 vote.
"It's about trust between us - the people - and our political party now", he said.
They want to try to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you get away with this.
He added in his message to the crowd: "I want you to put pressure on your political party to abandon Brexit.
We are activating a public army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.
At the same time, supporters of the EU held a protest in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners of Brexit supporters after the group was launched over the weekend.
Adonis, a Labour Party deputy, mocked the Conservatives over security issues that came up in the party's phone book when the convention opened.
"These are the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for borderless, for free trade with Ireland without borders", he added.
This is a complete shock.
There's nothing like a good Brexit, he said.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. senator, says she plans to seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to a report in the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a city council meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been an outspoken critic of US President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's been the focus of concerns that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a civic meeting with residents of her constituency since Trump took office.
One of the presenters asked her if she would be interested in running for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and sing our government, and then they also need a woman as leader.
Arresting a suicide bomber at Sims from LSU
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, but he was shot to death Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person who saw the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to a 247sports report.
Wayde came to his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being on the scene, with a gun in his forums, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-3, Baton Rouge native who played in 32 games, including 10 starts, last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory on the orders of his team.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas took the seat ahead of Lewis Hamilton for the Saturday robbery that orders from the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start in the relay and almost broke Hamilton after defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first in the draw and allowed Hamilton to drive into the round at the end of the group stage, but it should have been able to score.
The Mercedes went into the trench one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged from a close fight where the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside after risking being left behind, after defending attempts in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started out as a late bloomer and finished seventh at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race, delaying the tyre change to try to finish fast and outperform Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He eventually went into the hole in the 44th circle but could not increase his speed in the remaining eight, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri stood up beautifully all weekend and was a true warrior to help me get ahead.
The team has done a great job of achieving this success", said Hamilton.
It was really bad physical exercise.
US President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her allegations that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated Supreme Court justice, of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but he did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad and cruel and uncontrollable".
"The only thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last few days, is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and cruel and uncontrollable", he said.
When you see the posts and you cry and then you say, "Hey, I didn't do it".
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, will you stop this?
Do you remember her answer... you're going to drop the file?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm not going to quit.
Now, wait a little bit.
We laughed... no, we didn't, he said, and he was chasing the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges against Kavanaugh were brought by Ford, and was leaked in early September.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I don't leave her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
She asked me to keep it in trust, and I did as she asked.
But her denial didn't seem to go well for the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: "I'll tell you what, it was really bad physical abuse.
She may not be laughing, but it was the worst physical torture I've ever seen.
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and urged Democrats to use the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods are used.
You see the cruelty, the desire, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to overcome to gain power and authority,' the president said, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 with the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars added to their loss on Friday in the Elite League to the Belfast Giants, by winning the next game on Saturday, 5-3 at Dundee.
The Giants got two points early on after a goal from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home run, but Dwyer then went on to win the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's Elite League side, but it had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game of the season, and the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m., after a replay from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford followed with a replay when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
It was then a lot of being in the first few minutes and Sullivan returned home to the game with the time of the show at 1:10 p.m. and Cownie then recovered after a fifteen-minute intermission from Matt Marquardt.
Dwyer saw the Giants out before the half when he scored his second goal of the game at the end of the first quarter.
The home team recovered and Bouchard tied the score once again when they were one man over in the 27th minute of another match.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen get Dundee over for the first time in a late second leg match and he secured his team a fifth-place win by halfway through the final match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after taking his own life to ensure that an airplane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and resulted in a tsunami.
The area continues to be ravaged by strong aftershocks, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite his colleagues having escaped the control tower that was hovering over the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was stationed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could safely make it through the air.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to a report by ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a shuttle from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We are very sad to report this", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could exceed 1,000, while the country's Maritime Administration says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong towns is restricted.
"The death toll is still rising because many bodies are still in ruins and cannot be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Up to six metres high waves have caused massive destruction in Palu, but a mass funeral will be held there on Sunday.
The military and passenger planes are working to bring in supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with a dead body.
There's little clean water.
Small businesses have been looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to find the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it could get worse.
Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and told the army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the projects related to crime.
Are you ready? CNN said.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that the plane is missing after it crashed over London
The airline, which had a plane that crashed over Lone in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had survived the sinking.
Air News said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon it was unaware of the alleged abduction of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
The exact cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in the air just before the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the aircraft had been very low-flying.
'It was really good,' Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others could swim the mid-deep water and get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the crew were frightened and shouting and that he had suffered a mild headache.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who had been working on a brewery had also helped with the rescue by using a bloated boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents over the past two decades, but none of them were connected to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors filed their case on Saturday in a reopened case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent many hours in courtroom as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the prosecution how he used cell phone records to compare the journeys of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett reportedly received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, across his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chamber had his cell phone at the same time as he was said to have been with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was a "lucky" thing, because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Phone records showed they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis had erased her text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He took her out of his life", Hale said.
The defenders are expected to deliver their final address on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be heard later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to fight negative attitudes toward the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has shifted its origins to political messages and social issues.
They want to find their origins back and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists on board The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York City foster parents are suing a married couple for a misdemeanor charge of sexual assault following a false text message.
A foster mother in New York is suing a couple for illegal sexual assault after she received a surprise text message from her mother complaining that she was a black person.
The couple, however, refuses to be prejudiced and liken the lawsuit to a bribe.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when she learned that her newborn, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first went to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them to Miss Maurice twice.
After discovering her mistake, the comical Plasco-Flaxman Sister Maurice said that their ex-female, a thin-skinned fetus, had been ill and that she expected to have a Filipino woman, according to a New York Post report.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple and seeking compensation for the breach, amounting to $350 a day for the six-month job she had originally been hired to do, although no contract has been signed.
"I wanted to show them that this is not the way to do things", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know this is discrimination".
The couple have disputed the accusations of prejudice, saying that the dismissal of Maurice was the right thing to do, since they felt that they could not trust her after discouraging her.
My wife sent her a message she didn't mean to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not a people of curiosity", said her husband, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
But who would trust their children to someone after showing appropriate generosity, even if it was surprising?
You've given birth to your baby?
Don't let it go like this.
Plasco liked the lawsuit with the money laundering, and said his wife had arrived seven months earlier and was in very difficult circumstances.
Would you attack someone in this situation?
It's not very beautifully done", said Plasco, an investment banker.
The case is still open, but the public has been harshly criticizing the couple on social media, ashamed of their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like talking bears, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to follow in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very funny now that we know of the Paddington's enormous success.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC playwright before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small teddy bear, had taken his work with a more balanced positive attitude, adding that the publication's 60th anniversary was "deceased" by his passing last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "an important family member", she added that her father had shown a voice of pride in his success in the end.
"He was a very loud man and did not have a habit of talking", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who's doing something, and you're proud of it even if you didn't actually do anything yourself.
I think he somehow felt that way about Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was his creator and imagination, he always honored Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
By the time she was dead, her daughter had been transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried their best to save her life, but to no avail.
"Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up were slowly losing their function and leaving her body.
She had died a short time before, and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I could not cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who knew nothing of the difficulties she was experiencing.
"No one knew anything", she said.
I nodded and tears came out all the time.
It is hard to explain, but while on the flight, I felt deep compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Concerned women hang messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women, who had lovers who committed suicide, are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a message board on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers for people to call and get help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I have to feel like I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son had been a successful chef with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could describe any room.
He stopped working before he died, for he was thrown down into a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that it will be followed up.
Ms. Davis offered the message to let people know that it's possible to go and talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit and say nothing - you need to talk to someone.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sick or depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his life.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his face would be very upsetting to them, but that they would be relieved: "This is a terrible loss for the family.
This is what separates us.
But we must persevere and fight.

The future of Bret Kavanaugh hangs in the balance.
'I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a limited time and scope of study - we might reach a little agreement,' said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be torn apart amid a split between the parties where everything was in shambles.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigating the case?
Their trade is due to timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6. If Republicans do not do as expected, their efforts to get their husband elected to the country's highest court will be severely undermined.
George W. Bush has been calling on the Senate to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, through him, but she was Mr. Bush's personal friend.
What happens after the FBI releases its investigation report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him as a Supreme Court justice.
Number of North Koreans fleeing under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean senator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by the South Korean Joint Council, said that 1,127 people fled last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by smugglers with people were key.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their home countries.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused primarily on postponed nuclear disarmament talks.
This was after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a bitterly bitter way to work together towards a nuclear-free Korean War.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told American businesspeople about the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no guarantee of our country's security and under these circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "maternal illness" and says he's unfit to serve as a Supreme Court Justice
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's nominee, "an obstetrician", and said he was too creative to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these words in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever let herself go like this, she would have been called a maternity patient", Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes yelling at the audience and getting a kick in the throat as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned the Democratic members of the committee, calling the charges against him "a violent and organized genocide" orchestrated by liberal people angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against Democrats.
"I think these allegations and the way he attacked Mrs Clinton and Democrats show that he is unfit for the job", she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if Democrats win a majority in Congress.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade abortion laws, where he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is no time for a motherly, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say how wonderful it is", Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
This is a righteous saying, months and years of mourning flowing forth, and it will not go away without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry", said Miss Steinem, 45 years later.
I guess it's not uncommon, but you do?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere and said she cried too when she was crying, but she had developed a technique so that when she cried and started crying, she said to her interviewer, "You might think I'm dumb because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was a big hit.
Anger is allowed to be expressed in part because of a basic misunderstanding.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job was in an office with mostly men, where I started crying from a voice I couldn't express, an older woman came and grabbed my hip.
"Don't ever let me see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're a prom queen.
They think you're a fool and are happy to have gotten in.
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president, but she was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat in the name of Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his speech, Ms. Schroeder, furious, felt that there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
"It was not a well-chosen decision", she said laughingly to me, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed to keep was one more.
Someone called it "White Mountain and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign drawing to a close, she was in a hurry to raise funds, so she called to not run unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not be running, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - gratitude for the people who had supported her, anger at the system, which made it so difficult to raise funds and direct her eyes to voters instead of representatives, and anger at the sexism - that she cried.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown", said Ms. Schroeder, "she remembers the media reaction.
You might think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my tablet?
She was crying?
The reasons why a trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots of the U.S.-China trade war were glorious, and while the war is far from over, the gap between the two countries could be advantageous to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump launched his first defense shot earlier this year by taxing China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest step came this week with new tariffs that hit $200 billion worth of goods, taxing nearly half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded with the same currency each time, recently imposing a 5 to 10 percent tariff on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has been calling for a U.S. tariff response, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to slow down.
To get Washington to jump, you have to let go of demands, but it would be all too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to publicly bend over to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing were to keep its bets on the game, the pressure of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the need for mutual economic cooperation.
"The fact that a swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that could lead to economic downturns in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, a Asia-focused researcher at the New American Security Center.
Syria is preparing to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return willingly and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which is now in a dire state after seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to recover from normal circumstances by building areas that were run by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic decisions that targeted their daily lives and jobs.
It is estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million still living in the country are in need of assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian authorities would be happy to seek help in rebuilding the country.
However, he emphasized that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that had fomented the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team by a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 points at the Le Golf National Stadium outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight European titles and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team, led by Danish forward Thomas Bjorn, scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had the most difficulty throughout the tournament, crashed his starting pitch above the water at the 16th hole, which is a pair of 3, losing his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been a top scorer in all of his matches, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, but he was the lowest ranked player in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the top ranked golfer in the world, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who was possibly playing in his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Spanish rider Sergio Garcia, who has won the Ryder Cup eight times, became the most successful European at 25.5 points per game.
I usually don't cry, but today, I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I was happy to be able to help", said the sentimental Garcia after winning Europe.
He's beating his country's John Rahm torch, but he beat the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single-elimination match on Sunday.
"I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the greatest players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only second to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard weekend on the court, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played well throughout the tournament.
U.S. Representative Jim Furyk said after being disappointed with his team's performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime that morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take the top for Thomas.
He's a great lecturer.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll keep going.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their representative.
You have to get over it.
They played better than us.
Dry flower news: Density decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission show a general decline in the density of dried leaves in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, weaker dry flowers have been reported in certain areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating decreasing density.
The blue flower covers some 200 miles [200 km] of coastline from Pinellas County north to Lee County south.
Individual flowers can be found about 10 miles [16 km] from Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than in the past week.
There have also been reports of drought in Pasco County.
A medium-density area near or adjacent to Pinellas County was reported last week, a small to large density off the coast of Hillsborough County, a very small to large density in Manatee County, a very small to large density in or near the coast of Sarasota County, a very small to medium density in Charlotte County, a very small to large density in or near the coast of Lee County, and a small density in Collier County.
Respiratory activity has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No reports of any airborne incidents in northwest Florida have been made in the past week.
