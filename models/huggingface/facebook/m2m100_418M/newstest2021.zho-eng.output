New China Time Review: Make the Good Return to Country Farmers Work to the Rural Resuscitation Forces - New China Network
Rural development is key.
Where do people look for?
A good return to the countryside of farmers is an indispensable force of life.
The New Year’s Eve.
New China Agency Chengdu on July 26 telegraph topic: bringing excellent returns to the countryside farmers to make the rural revitalization life force
This year, the 34-year-old Zhang Hyun family was in the Qingdao Qingdao City Fruit Garden Village, and in 2010 he resigned from Beijing's monthly wage of thousands of jobs to return to the country.
After a few years of struggle, he now operates a wheat grocery family farm with an annual income of more than a million dollars, becoming a small renowned richer leader, and was also chosen to enter the village "two committees" group.
In recent years, under the call of a series of agricultural and agricultural policies, such as the country’s deforestation and resuscitation, more and more excellent farmers like Zhang Hyun have chosen to return to the countryside to start and activate the rural spring water.
China’s western population major province, labour export major province of Sichuan, due to the interests of the implementation of the “excellent farmer workers recruitment education project”, only in 2019, from the recruitment of excellent farmer workers produced more than 8,000 secretaries of the village party branch, cultivated the village reserve force 6,10,000 people, developed more than 20,000 members of the party, to win the fight against poverty and implement the rural revitalization strategy provide a strong guarantee.
It is very important to look at the old town.
Since the reform and opening, a large number of youth and youth workers in the country’s rural areas have increased the income of foreign workers, some have established their own enterprises by combining.
But objectively, it also led to rural “lucky heart” appearance in different degrees, especially the weakening of rural basic organizations, the secretary of the village party branch and the party membership both showed the characteristics of “a old and low”, that is, age aging, academic qualifications are low, the village party organization leads the lead team is not strong, yellow and yellow don’t take the problem out.
If rural talents and other elements have always flowed one-to-one to the city, the countryside has long been in a “bloodless” “anemia” state, revitalization is a word.
Attract the farmers who are capable, conscious and willing to serve their homeland and land back, guide them back to the country’s entrepreneurship to become rich leaders, from the choice to the training of members of the party, rural personnel, to fill the basic level of personnel, this is a solution to the unacceptable management of the rural party members and basic level of party organizations.
Good farmers will be brought back, and they will be able to stay and work well.
In recent years, Qingdao began to build the Farmers’ Workers’ Party, on the basis of strictly selected standards, to establish a system mechanism for excellent farmers’ work-oriented return, service guarantee, training output, selection use, allowing them to improve their capacity, work to be guaranteed, life to be hopeful, really are rooted in the countryside, managing entrepreneurs have a sense of achievement.
This year is the year of decision-making fighting against poverty and strengthening, making the fighting against poverty and strengthening the link with rural resuscitation, talent is a key factor.
The Parliamentary Committee Government at all levels should pay great importance to this group of excellent returning farmers and farmers, through comprehensive measures, make them a working team and vital force that can stay, be able to fight, be able to take away, and provide strong organizational guarantees and talent support for rural poverty and prosperity and development.
Because of the epidemic, this year's university graduates are a very special event, on the evening of July 11, Bilibili Summer Graduate Song will bring a special online live show for graduates, Old Wolves, Park Tree, Li Yu Spring, Mao and other musicians send songs and blessings to graduates.
The famous upper SealWu Wu Yuan also brought a “Wild Grain”, which is his singing song based on the same name of the Luthin Poetry Collection, which is very popular among the young people.
Due to the relationship of the epidemic, many graduates were unable to realize the ceremonial sense of the site, giving the degree certificate, they transferred the ceremonial sense to the internet.
The data show that the song, which lasted 2.5 hours, has a peak of more than 35 million live broadcasts.
“Follow your own heart, take the opportunity, not counting the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected harvest.”
Although it is a graduate song, many songs also impress non-graduate graduates.
“The whole game looks like it really wants to cry, who’s youth is full of beauty and regret, but it’s worth remembering, all must be courageous to go down.”
Beijing Natural Ecology Continues to Go Good Attracting More than 500 Wildlife Cities "Residences"

Capital Natural Ecology Continues to Go Good Attracting Wild Animals City "Residences"
Beijing Wildlife has more than 500 species.
The Beijing Youth Journal reporter was informed from the City Gardening Greening Bureau that in recent years, with the continued improvement of the capital’s natural ecological environment, the species and number of wild animals also continued to increase.
Currently, the habitat of land-born spinal wild animals in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including country-level protective animals such as brown horse, blackberry and other, as well as national second-level protective animals such as zeppelin, big swine, grapefruit, pepper.
Whether it is planted in a city forest in the two corners, or a small wet area embedded between the buildings, it not only brings the wildness of nature to the capital citizens, but also attracts wild animals to the city’s “setting”.
During the summer season, a part of life in the Monsanto national level natural protection area located in the Yunnan mountains in the northwest of Yunnan region.
A puppy on the side of the mountain quietly playing, on the side, two puppy rush each other.
In the end of 2019, in this total area of more than 6200 hectares of green sea, living including the national level of animal protection gold sculptures and the national second level of animal protection chicken, zeppelin and 178 wild animals, one-third of the wild species of the city can see traces here.
“In Monsanto, wild animals are true ‘masters’, our staff can only be considered ‘guards’ of people’.”
He said, in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the protected area, there are more than 30 professional guard teams every day, along 16 carefully designed protective routes inspections, and every month there will be a "transforming circle", with a whole day of time almost all over the protected area.
“In the inspection, not only to check the record of biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial bird nests, the help of wounded wild animals, the installation of outdoor infrared cameras, etc.
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Monsanto National Nature Conservation Area to record the state of living of wild animals in the forest.
As the biodiversity of the protected areas has been increasingly enriched in the years, more and more wild animals appear in the lens, leopard cats, rabbits and pigs have become "permanent guests", the national second-level protection of animal spider's "excellence rate" is increasingly high.
Long Zhang Zhi Ming, Directorate of the Beijing City Gardening Greening Bureau for Wildlife and Plant and Wetlands Protection, announced that Beijing land-based vertebral wildlife has increased from 461 species in 1994, to more than 500 species today, and Beijing's wildlife species and number have continued to increase in recent years.
The image of wild animals in the city is becoming more and more common and is closely linked to the continued upgrading of the capital city in recent years.
In particular, a new round of a million hectares of forest green construction, which began in 2018, proposed to re-form the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of the forest and green areas, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
Planning aims to interconnected interaction with the surrounding green area, facilitating wild animals "to visit friends", the trees are also the animals' favorite honey source, food source plants.
I am committed to helping computers and the world around us communicate.
There are many ways to do this, I like to focus on helping computers talk about the content they see and understand.
Given such a scenario, a modern computer visualization algorithm can tell you there is a woman and there is a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I deal with this question Thinking about how humans understand and live with the world.
Those thoughts, memories, and stories In such scenarios, may attract human attention.
The interconnection of all circumstances.
Per you’ve ever seen such a dog, or you’ve ever spent time running on such a sandy beach, and further awakening past holiday memories and ideas, before going to the beach when spending on with other dogs, running to run time.
One of my guidelines is to help computers understand what kind of experience it is, and thus to understand what we believe and feel in common, then we have the ability to start continuously developing computer technology in a way that is complementary to our experience.
So, deepening this point, I started a few years ago dedicated to helping computers produce human-like stories, from image series.
So, one day, when I was working with a computer, I asked him what he thought about the trip to Australia.
He looked at the picture and saw a bag of bears.
It doesn’t know what a bag bear is, but the computer says it believes that bag bear looks like a very interesting creature.
Then I shared with the computer a series of images about the house burned.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, “This is a stunning landscape!
It makes my back cold.
The computer sees a terrible, changing life and destroying life event and thinks it is a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognizes the comparison of red and yellow, and I think that’s something that’s worth a positive assessment.
Partly because I enter most of the computer is a positive image.
That’s because when people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw your own photo at the funeral?
I realize that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it is a task to task, data to data sets, in computer understanding, creating huge gap, faults and blind points.
While doing this, I’m coding for various prejudices.
Prejudice reflects limited perspectives, arising from a set of data – which reflects the same humans, such as perceptions and scripts.
I remember the development of the technology, which allowed me to get to the position I was on that day—the first colored image was scaled for a white woman’s skin color, which means that colored photography has a deviation from the black face.
And the same deviation, that blind point continued to bring into the 90s.
The same blind point even today, still exists in the application of facial recognition technology, how to recognize the faces of different characters.
In today’s research, I think of the most advanced technologies, all tending to put our ideas, limited to a data set and a problem.
And doing so, we are creating more blind points and prejudices that will be further enlarged when using artificial intelligence.
At that time I realized that we had to think deeply about how we invented creative technology today, and how it would be seen in five to ten years.
In the interaction between man and the environment, man takes time to fix the problem and thus evolves slowly.
In comparison, artificial intelligence is developing at an incredible pace.
That means it’s really important, we now have to carefully consider this —— to reflect on our own blind points, and prejudices, and to consider how these prejudices have influenced the technology we create now, and to discuss what today’s technology means for the future.
CEOs and scientists have balanced their ideas about the future of artificial intelligence development.
Stephen Hawking warns that “artificial intelligence will destroy human beings.”
Elon Musk warns that this is a risk that exists, and that is one of the greatest risks that we as a civilized society face.
Bill Gates said, “I don’t understand why people don’t worry more about artificial intelligence.”
But these views – are just part of the story.
The mathematics, the models, the basic components of these artificial intelligence, are all we can obtain and use.
We have open source tools to the public to learn machines and at the same time make our contribution.
In addition, we can also share our experiences.
We can share in the technical aspects and their relationships with us, and how we are fascinating.
We can talk about what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, about the technical aspects that may be more useful, or over time, more problems may arise.
If we are all focused on Open to Artificial Intelligence discussions looking forward to the future, this will help to create a regular dialogue and awareness about what is Artificial Intelligence? what can it be? and everything we need to do to the most suitable results for us.
We have seen and understood this in the technology we use today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic dust smellers.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes yes.
Are they useful?
Yes, they are also.
They are not completely the same.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we create and create now.
We launched the Domino Card Effect, which opened the evolution of artificial intelligence.
In our time, we have shaped the artificial intelligence of tomorrow.
Let us be immersed in the technology of enhanced reality, bringing the world of the past to life again.
When people have difficulty communicating, technology helps them to share their experiences with each other.
Based on online visual media technology, it can be used in automotive driving.
Technology produces language based on image understanding, which can evolve into technologies that help people with visual disabilities and help them better possess the visual world.
We also see how technology leads to some problems.
Today we have technology to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth — such as the color of our skin or the expression of our faces — to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have technology to process data, process data about gender or race to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now is just a quick picture of the evolution process of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now, is a moment of evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future development of things and extend to the future world.
If we want artificial intelligence to help human beings evolve, we need to define strategies and goals and immediately open that path.
I want to see the direction of development of the culture and the environment that suits mankind.
Technology can help us heal diseases of the nervous system or other disabilities, make them like everyone, make life as challenging.
The functioning of technology will not take into account your characteristics or skin color.
Today I’m focusing on tomorrow and the next decade of technology.
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it is not without any destination.
This is a car we can drive at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether to turn.
What will be the future of artificial intelligence?
There will be a wide arena. allowing artificial intelligence to be everything.
It will become a lot of different things.
Now it depends on what we need to realize to ensure that the results of artificial intelligence are better for all humans.
thank you.

Black land "sets" out of agriculture modernization - New China Network
New China Agency Harbin July 26 tel: Black land "setting" out of agriculture modernization
During the summer, two spraying drug aircraft crossed the thousand hectares of high-production demonstration fields of the Friendship Farm's Fifth Management Zone's second operating station, forming two white lines, the green fields with black rice grains raised "the first place of heaven" several large words especially awakened.
The head of the operating station, Confucius, said that the aircraft could throw drugs on more than 6,000 hectares of land per day, with efficiency approximately eight times more than the drones, and hundreds of times more than the artificial ones.
This farming is located within the territory of China's first food production province, Chalonjiang province of Friendship County, from the past "Rong" cutting voice to the today "Rong" Mada voice, Chinese traditional agriculture and farming achieved a cutting change on this black soil.
In addition to the aircraft, the satellite is also used in the modern agricultural production of the Friendship Farm.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensor technology to accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural investments and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operations level in the fields of agricultural machines.
During this year’s rice production, the farming expanded the operating area of satellite navigation and drone infusion technology from 3,000 hectares last year to 30,000 hectares.
This technology makes the crops more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and land resources, and saves 16 yuan per hectare of artificial cost.
Farms attempted new technologies in agricultural production to informate, intelligent, and formed the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the current total holding of agricultural machinery is 490,000 units, and the field-comprehensive mechanization rate is 99.8%.
The agricultural machine operation achieves 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% dry field accuracy plantation, 100% dry field Damar motor vehicle operation.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture are the pathway to modernization of agriculture.”
Friendship Farm Manager Liu Chilin said.
The key to modernization of agriculture is technological progress.
In recent years, Chalonjiang farmers, represented by farms, have played the demonstration and lead role of modernized large-scale agriculture "aircraft carrier", initially establishing a modern agricultural industrial system that is dominated by scaled farming, standardized production, and industrialized business.
In the suburbs of the Friendship County, there is a farm machine exhibition park that covers an area of 350,000 square meters.
It focuses on the exhibition of more than 140 (pets) agricultural machinery introduced and used by Black Lonjiang Farmers over the years.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of modernization of our agriculture.

Xinhua Agency Reporter Chen Chang Camp, Wang Li Wu, Liu Shay Village
More than 4 p.m. on July 25th, Fou Quinbo was dressed in bull-filled shoes, from the front house to the back house, and his wife, Zhu Yin, came back to the land busy packing things.
“I got the call of the village officer to transfer, I’m still in the countryside.
Fou Kunbo said, he turned more than 60 hectares of land, planted rice, at the moment it was good, “Yesterday I got the drug, the tool was not yet packed.
Fou Kunbo pointed to a pesticide spray that was placed in the corner, “No one wants to be drowned in the house, let the small house be for everyone.”
In order to respond to the continued high level of water pressure and the potential strong rainfall in the Nest Lake, Anjou Province's Fertilizer City is prepared to open the Flood Water Division of the Qingdao River Union, which is located in Fuku Qingdao family on 26th.
Qingdao River Union is located in the Mumbai County, close to Nest Lake.
There are thousands of villagers involved in the hard shop countryside and three river towns that need to be transferred.
By 25th, 16:00, China's fifth largest freshwater lake Nest Lake water level remains at 13.2 meters high, super guaranteed water level 0.7 meters.
The kitchen of Fukuyama was clean and clean, on the table was placed a cup of peanut butter, and in the refrigerator there were eggs and some peanut butter.
“I don’t think I’m going to move, the water of Chiang Mai is now looking good.”
Zhu Yin said that the house is a flat room, some large objects have not yet thought to go where to put.
“First, make up the precious items, the refrigerator, the TV, these big things can be temporarily placed to the high-end neighbors or relatives.
The countryside officer gave the idea to Fukushima.
Wang Shui is responsible for the transfer settlement work of 13 villagers, one house and one house announces, confirming the settlement plan for each.
The nearest settlement point from Fukuyama is the Hard Shop Rural Su Primary School, about 2 km away.
In addition to the big things, Fou Quinbo has a headache with more than 1,000 kilograms of food and some newly purchased furniture.
“Food is ready to get to family, furniture can’t be moved.”
The couple discussed, put the seat under the newly purchased bed and lifted the bed up about half a meter.
At 6 a.m., Fu Kunbo began transporting goods with three wheels to his relatives, and Zhu Yin continued to pack at home.
More than at 11 a.m., the couples looked back and back again in front of the house, pulled the bridge and prepared to go to the settlement point.
I hope the water goes back sooner.
Fujimori said.
On July 26, at 9:30 a.m., the journalists saw at the Qingdao River Union site that the local authorities were prepared for the flooding.
Zhang after Colin's small house team is quite muscle youth - New China Network
Sports Youth Hot Blood Competition Show "Sport Bar Youth" officially landed in Lake Southern Guard on July 11.
The sports leader Zhang Zhongko and the sports assistant Lin's small house crossed the same stage, Linden and Fujimori criticized each with a style, while the hard nucleus of the "Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand-Grand.
At first, 11 sports youths showed the power railway, the appearance surprised the audience at the scene, while "strong conflict" on the stadium, "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" were also concerned.
Among them, “strong conflict” comes from Super A athlete Jovan I, who before the match openly provokes with the raceway with the name of “Flow Beautiful Man” of Xu Zhi-bin, the appearance of Xu Zhi-bin should go to the dance program, and even release “Lost don’t make make the make-up cry.”
The discourse made the young people and the sports leaders in the field smoke a cold breath.
And the “strong confrontation” is more like the Godfather’s battle, known as the “Great Devil King” Sun Qing Shui encounters the same powerful Zhang Qing, playing a strong confrontation.
And their identity also makes people unpredictable, Sun Qing Shui is an attorney who loves fitness, while Zhang Qing is a retired special team member, three times warrior medals winner.
At the beginning of the match, the two young men made their best to quickly remove the small bowl, and the permanent confrontation on the big bowl gave the audience a sweat for them.
Under the stressful conditions, Zhang Zhongko as one of the sports leaders of Sport Bar Youth, was also seriously watching the battle.
In the review section, he was also very careful, encouraging the youth to the losing side of the game with patience, helping each mistake point in the recovery process.
And the sports assistant Lin's house is a floral assistant, she doesn't hide the appreciation of the teenagers of color power online.
It is more admirable to learn about the daily training of sports teenagers overload.
Likewise, Linden and Fujimori of the sports leaders each have a style, one is the "prophetic" and one is the "Fujimori Girl" that disperses the tension atmosphere with a smile.
In addition, Gick Twain and Liu Twain as sports assistants, also created a lot of jokes around sports youth.
French Southern Church Fire: Catholic Volunteers Recognize Fireing Ordinary and Good Words
According to foreign media, on 18 July, the religious historical architecture of Nantes, the famous St. Peter and the Cathedral of St. Paul, was seriously damaged in a fire, and the wing was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, Nantes prosecutor announced that a Cathedral volunteer responsible for the defence work in the cathedral has been charged with the accusation of "incendious destruction".
He acknowledged he was burning himself in the church.
The local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old, a parish volunteer from Rwanda, admitted that he had burned three of the cathedral in the night.
The lawyer said the firefighters are now regreting doing this.
This man arrived in France a few years ago through the way of refuge, received refuge in the parish area where the fire occurred, and received refuge in the church.
The prosecutor said he recently tried to update his visa and was undergoing a dialogue with the police.
But the church said it was still unwilling to believe that the believer who was always very kind, with a smile, but not much speaking, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the same day that the fire occurred on July 18, the volunteer had already received a police questionnaire due to logical incomprehensibility in the story, but he was later released.
The firefighters were rescued on the site.
On the evening of the 25th, a professional engineer from the Central Police Bureau Laboratory in Paris got new evidence, and the man was again.
This time, the man acknowledged his fire.
According to the report, if the accusation of intentional fire destruction was established, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of €150,000.
The fire caused serious losses to St. Pierre and the Cathedral of St. Paul, the gallery in the church was completely burned, and the colored glass windows behind the gallery were seriously damaged.
Brune, the chief architect of the French historical architecture, believes that the conservative estimates that the restoration of the Cathedral of Nantes will take at least three years.
Comprehensive News: U.S. unilateralism destroys relations between the two countries International Public Opinion supports China's anti-U.S. resistance
In the morning of July 24, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the U.S. Embassy in China that the Chinese party decided to withdraw the creation and operation of the U.S. General Consulate in Chengdu, and specified requirements for the General Consulate to stop all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the U.S. cause serious trouble to the relations between China and the U.S. and that China is unreasonable to respond to the U.S. and that it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrew Bolks, director of the China Research Center at the Institute of International Affairs of the University of Chile, said the unilateralism of the U.S. has broken the bridge of understanding between the people of the two countries and has led the relations of the two great nations to a crisis.
China informs the U.S. that the closure of its Chengdu Consulate is a rejection of unilateral measures against the U.S. and is in accordance with diplomatic practices.
Patricio Justo, Professor of the Catholic University of Argentina and Director of the Center for A-Chinese Research, believes that the above decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasures against the previous provocations of the United States, not against the ordinary American people.
The U.S. tries to transfer the attention of the U.S. people by pressing China to hide its inability to respond to the New Crown epidemic.
Banban Suljono, Chairman of the Center for Asian Innovation Research in Indonesia, said the U.S. is taking a provocative diplomatic attitude, causing serious trouble to the relations between the two countries, and the relations between the two countries are facing serious challenges.
China informs the U.S. that closing its Consulate in Chengdu is a normal counteraction measure, in accordance with diplomatic practices, both reflects China’s principle position of determined defense of its own interests, and also reflects the reasonable benefit of China’s diplomacy.
Tansania Times commentator Francis Sem Winzha said that the above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the U.S. provokation.
China and the U.S. relations should return to normal, the U.S. should initially improve relations with China and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs.
The U.S. should look at how it can win with China economically and politically, and how it can benefit the people of both countries and even the international community as a whole.
Ali Yousafzai, executive director of the Arab-China Friendship Association Federation, headquartered in Sudan, said that China's countermeasures were forced to be a legitimate and necessary response to unreasonable actions by the U.S., in accordance with the basic standards of international law and international relations, and in accordance with diplomatic practices.
The U.S. has previously demanded the closure of China’s General Consulate in Houston to seriously violate international law and the basic standards of international relations.
We hope the U.S. will revoke the previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return to normal relations between the two countries.
The United Morning Newspaper said that the bigger strategic intention of the United States is to circumvent China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the U.S. steps, although China is very unwilling to see China and the U.S. relations continue to deteriorate, it is forced to take countermeasures.

It is known that this joint operation has launched eight vessels and two helicopters, divided into several operating groups to cooperate fighting, to carry out a whole chain attack on maritime trafficking, land illegal operations, and 35 major criminal suspects are all in the case.
The case is currently under further investigation.
Guangdong Sea Police Bureau officials said that the future will continue to maintain high pressure, fight maritime trafficking and criminal activities, and maintain good order in the waters of the good jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hanna" landed in Medjugorje or caused river floods and floods
The local time, 25 July, at 5 p.m., the Hurricane "Hanna" landed in the U.S. Texas, will bring to Texas strong storms, river waters rising, and may also cause life-threatening floods.
The National Hurricane Center said it is expected that the Hurricane "Hanna" will interfere with storms, flooding parts of the south and northeastern parts of the state, rains or causing some rivers to rise and flooding that threatens life.
The most seriously affected by the Hurricane "Hanna" is south of the city of Copers Christie to the Gulf of the Grand River, while the Valley of Rio de Janeiro may have a massive flood.
Teksas Governor Abbott said: “Every hurricane is a huge challenge.”
There are 32 districts in the state that have become emergency due to the hurricane.
The city, with more than 320,000 inhabitants, has closed libraries and museums.
Abbott also said that the hurricane could no longer cause more casualties to Texas as the New Crown epidemic is underway.
The rainfall in the southern Texas region is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches in the night on 26th, with 3 to 5 inches of rainfall in the northern Texas and the coast of Louisiana.
Due to the influence of factors such as global warming, the formation of "Hanna" was earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually will form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from the European Treaty to Prevent Violence Against Women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Polish right-wing government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, violating the rights of student parents.
Polish Justice Minister Zhublou held a press conference said that the Ministry of Justice under his leadership will on Monday ask the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty.
The Treaty is also called the Istanbul Convention.
“The treaty contains some of the elements that we consider to be harmful.
The ruling law in Poland has close alliances with the Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners with the Roman Catholic Church, promoting a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda has seen hostility against homosexual rights as one of the main topics during the successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (most of them women) held protests in Warsaw and other cities against the withdrawal from the Convention.
One of the protest organizers, Lampat, said in a demonstration in Warsaw that “the goal of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence.”
Some protesters holded the roofs and wrote that “Law and Justice Party is the hell of women.”
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The former median government in Poland approved the Convention in 2015.
The law and Justice Party government said the treaty did not respect religion and required the teaching of liberal social policies in schools.
But the party has not yet decided to withdraw from the convention.

Upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter card-52M first launched at the end of the year
According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgrade version of the Russian armed helicopter Kar-52 – Kar-52M will be completed for the first time in December of this year, the model will have a significant improvement in detection, communication and weapons performance.
According to the Russian News, the U-52M is named "Super Short Kiss Crocodile", its development contract was signed in April last year by the Russian military and military industrial units, and the first two of the U-52 is currently in the "progressive" Russian Aerospace Group's Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Factory, which will receive the transformation replacement, its national level testing and improvement finish work will be completed by October 2022.
According to the Russian experts of the above upgrading work, the "predecessor" of the "super short kiss crocodile" was officially listed in November 2011, the model revealed some weaknesses in the use, this upgrading was just to "supplement the shortboard".
According to the report, compared to the Car-52, the Car-52M will be partially adopted a new type of defense material that will not increase weight, its pilot seat will be strengthened, equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the likelihood of the battlefield survival; installing a larger power generator to supply electricity to more complex aircraft electronic equipment; optical system upgrades, capable of detection, identifying the distances of the battlefield targets; equipped with the main attack arms and steel muscle concrete defense works new light and multi-use missiles, its shot range is up to 20 km, the same type of missile shot range is approximately 1 times greater than the Russian active army used directly; its defense weapons and communications equipment will make the maximum of connected with the
In addition, the Car-52M will be equipped with more advanced electronic control systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said it is important to note that the Car-52M will be equipped with communication equipment that connects with drones, thus receiving information from nearby drones in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the seat screen of the helicopter.
As planned, the Car-52M pilot will be able to direct control of the drones that collaborate with them, thereby improving the pilot's control of the situation in the battlefield and the control of the remote missiles.
According to the Russian media, Deputy Minister of Defense Krivoruchiko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to buy more than 110 armed direct-52M cards by 2027.

Hanoi has since this year river lake ecological water supply 17.5 million cubic meters.
The journalist from the Hanoi Province Water Hall learned that since this year, Hanoi Province has integrated the use of reservoir water and local reservoir water, followed by the implementation of 28 rivers and white ocean rivers, such as Tong River, Don River, Dengma River, and other, and has completed the river lake ecological reservoir of 17.5 million cubic meters.
The province of Hanoi has strictly captured the favorable opportunity for the Southern Water and Northern Cutting Central Line to increase the flow of water transfers, and the use of the river water to the rivers such as Don River, Sand River, Chalon River and other rivers has implemented the ecological water supply.
At the same time, using nine large, medium-sized water reservoirs, such as the West Ocean, East Wuhan, and White Ocean Dining to the rivers of the Sun River, the Sun River and other rivers, the ecological water supply was implemented, and a total of more than 90 square kilometers of water surface was formed.
In order to do the work of ecological water repair, the Hanoi Province Water Hall actively organizes the conduct of the repair river hazards investigation, repair strengthening and river cleaning work, detail the implementation measures, and strengthen the inspection and control.

You should all know the facts I’m going to say.
I think this intuition that inequality can cause social divisions and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the effects of inequality by comparing society, equality, and different societies.
I will show you some data and explain why those data are really related.
But first, let’s see how hard our lives are.
I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This picture shows our average lifetime relative to the total national income – which is measured by the country’s average wealth.
You can see the countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, whose wealth is twice as high as the countries on the left, Israel, Greece and Portugal.
But this does not affect the average life of their citizens.
There are no signs of interrelation.
But if we go to understanding within the society, we can find a great difference in their health conditions within the whole society.
The picture shows that it remains an average life.
These are the small towns of England and Wales – the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There is a great difference between the poor and the others.
Even those just below the top, their health is worse than those at the top.
So income means very much in our society, but comparison between different societies has no meaning.
The contradiction is that in our society we see the relative income or the social status, the identity – the interrelationship between us and the size of the gap between people and people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think: what would happen if the gap extended? what would happen if the gap was reduced? what would happen if the gap was expanded or reduced?
That’s what I’m going to tell you immediately.
I do not use any assumption data.
My data from the United Nations – like the data from the World Bank – is about the income gap between these rich and developed democratic countries.
The method we use, easy to understand, and you can download, is to compare the income gap between the first 20% and the last 20% of each country.
You can see the countries on the left are equal – Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden – with their first 20 percent of wealth approximately 3.5 to 4 times the last 20 percent.
But on the other side of comparative inequality – in the UK, Portugal, the United States, and Singapore – the income gap is doubled.
In this comparison, the level of inequality in our country (UK) is twice as high in other equally successful democratic markets.
Next I will show how this affects our society.
We have collected data on the issues of social differences, which are more common in the lowest levels of society.
International comparable data include average lifetime, children’s mathematical and linguistic performance, child mortality, suicide, prison population ratio, young girls’ pregnancy, mutual confidence, obesity, and mental illnesses – all these diseases meet the standard diagnosed classifications including addiction and addiction – and social mobility.
We put all of this into one factor.
They are all powered by average.
A country’s score is the average of these factors.
You can see that these scores are related to the inequality I’ve just shown, and I’ll repeatedly show these data.
The more inequal countries are, the worse they are in various social issues.
Connectivity is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared to the per capita national income and the total national income index, then you will not find anything, no more relevant.
We have a bit of concern People might think We are choosing specific issues to meet our theory and then producing human evidence. so we also published a paper on the United Nations Children's Fund's Child Welfare Index in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different sections, from others’ summary.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether there are books in the house, how much immunity is, and whether there is an offensive phenomenon at school.
All included in.
This is the index with the same level of inequality.
In a society of inequality, the worse the performance of children.
Relationships and their significance.
But again, if you look at the relationship of child welfare with the per capita national income, you will get nothing.
All the data I present to you is the same.
The average well-being of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poor countries, but that is not the case for rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position compared to others seems very important nowadays.
Below I will show you some of the branches of our index.
This is the mutual trust index.
It refers to the percentage of people who agree that most people are trustworthy.
This is the data from the World Values Survey.
You can see that on the side of inequality, about 15% of people feel they can trust others.
But in a more equal society, this percentage increased to 60% or 65%.
If we look at the degree of participation in community activities or the assessment of social capital, there is a very similar connection to inequality.
I would say that we repeated this work twice.
We first targeted these wealthy developed countries, then we replaced the test objects, and repeated this test on 50 states in the U.S. – the same question: are the more inequal states doing the worse in all of these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality obtained by the Federal Government in a general social survey.
Very similar distribution in a similar level of trust.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all factors related to mutual trust reflected in international surveys are also reflected within the 50 states we survey each.
This is not a coincidence.
This picture is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization uses the same diagnostic interview method to collect data that allows us to compare the rates of psychic illness in each society.
This is the percentage of people suffering from any mental illness last year.
It range from 8% to more than 24%—this indicates that the percentage of people with mental illness in the whole society is three times the percentage of people with mental illness in other societies.
In the same way, all of these are closely linked to inequality.
This picture is the crime rate.
The red point represents the states of the United States and the blue triangle represents the provinces of Canada.
But look at the differences in their numbers.
The murder rate ranges from 15 to 150 per million.
This is the percentage of prison prisoners.
This is 10 times the gap, and the index function will increase this gap.
But the range of changes in prison numbers is from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main cause of this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more is a strict trial, or a more strict trial.
The more inequal society, the more it tends to preserve the death penalty.
This picture is the child's high school status.
Similarly, the gap is big.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we will find that the danger of this gap is very serious.
This picture is the social flow rate.
In fact, it is calculated on the basis of income.
Basically, it asks: Does a rich father have a rich child, a poor father has a poor child, or is there any connection between these two?
On the side of inequality, the income of the father is more important – for example, the UK, the United States.
And in Northern Europe, father’s income is not so important.
There are more social classes flowing there.
As we often say – I know there’s a lot of American listeners here – if Americans want to realize their “American dream”, they should go to Denmark.
(Smile) (Happiness) I’ve shown here with sliding signals.
I can also show you some other questions.
These issues are more common in the bottom of the social scale.
But there are endless issues of social scale, which appear worse in countries with inequality—not just a bit bad, but everything is to be twice and ten times worse.
Think about the expenses, the human expenses.
I want to go back to this previously shown picture We combine everything to explain the two points.
First, through a repeated chart, we found that those countries with poor performance, whatever, seemed to be those countries with more inequality, but those that performed well seemed to be both Northern Europe and Japan.
So we see the relationship between universal social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things are a problem, but almost everything.
Another very important point I want to point out on this picture is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show in all aspects that they are very different countries.
The position of women, the degree of their persistence to the small families, in the rich developed countries, is two extremes.
But another important difference is how they greater equality.
Sweden has great differences in income, but it reduces the gap with taxes, national welfare, generous aid, and so on.
Japan is quite different.
First, the Japanese pre-tax wage gap is relatively small.
Its taxes are lower.
The benefits are also less.
And in the studies of the U.S. states, we found a clear contrast.
Some states are performing well through re-distribution, while some states are performing well because the pre-tax income gap is small.
So we come to the conclusion How to greater equality is not important, it is important to that equality.
I’m not talking about complete equality, I’m talking about all that really exists in rich and developed market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this picture is that not only the poor are affected by inequality.
The words of John Don seem to be a little true: “No one is an isolated island.”
Through a series of studies, we are able to compare the behavior of people of each class in equal or more or less different countries.
This is just an example.
This picture is the child death rate.
According to the UK’s general socio-economic classification records, some Swedish people very kindly classified many baby deaths.
This is a class that does not match the age based on the father's position, so single mothers make up a set of data.
But we see the so-called “social low-class” which is handmade without technology.
The middle is the need for technical manual work, then to advanced non-manual work, always high to professional work – doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
Here we can see that Sweden is doing better than Britain, and it is doing better in every class of society.
The greatest difference occurs at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We show 5 different sets of data including U.S. and international educational results and health status.
In general, it seems that more equal societies show the most obvious differences at the bottom of society, but they also have some advantages at the top of society.
I have to explain what is happening.
I think I’m showing and discussing the impact of inequality on social psychology.
More is to focus on the sense of superiority and humility, being appreciated and neglected, being respected and degraded.
Of course, those feelings arising from the competition of identity status have promoted the progress of social consumerism.
But it also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how others judge and see us, whether we look attractive, intelligent, or so.
Social values increase the fear of these social values.
Interestingly, some similar work in the field of social psychology is going on the same way: some people reviewed 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers were invited to a psychoanalysis center and then tested their stress hormones and their reactions when they perform stress tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which type of pressure is the most likely to increase the level of corticosteroid in the body, the most important of the stress hormone.
The result is that tasks that include social assessment threats – tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status – in those tasks others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These stresses have a very special effect in stress physiology.
We have already received criticism.
Of course, some people don’t like this, and some find this very unexpected.
However, I should tell you when people criticize us to provoke data, we’ve never done that.
We have an unconditional provision If our data sources contain data of the observed country, then we incorporate it into analysis.
Our data sources determine whether the data is effective and not ours.
Otherwise there will be disadvantages.
And the other countries?
In the journal reviewed by academic colleagues, there were 200 studies on the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not limited to these countries here, hiding a very simple proof.
The same country the same method of measurement of inequality, the problem one by one.
Why do we not control other factors?
I have shown to you that the per capita national income has no influence.
Of course, there are also some more complex methods used in literature in the experiment to eliminate factors such as poverty, education.
What about Causal Relationship?
Relevance itself cannot prove a causal connection.
We spent a lot of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causal link of these results.
The greatest change in our understanding of wealthy developed countries is how important the long-term pressure from society has the impact on immunity and cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, the reason that violence is becoming more and more common in more inequal countries is because people are very sensitive to being ignored.
I want to say, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of issues after tax and before tax.
We should limit income, limit the top bonus income culture.
I think we must do our best to make our leaders responsible for our employees.
Finally, I want to summarize that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
Thus, we will find that we suddenly solve the social and mental health problems of the whole society, which is great.
thank you.
The praise)
In the past two weeks, the number of new crown cases in Spain has recovered significantly, with thousands of new cases on several days.
The British government on Saturday evening (July 25) temporarily decided to remove Spain from the secure travel list from the local time at 0 a.m. on 26th, and those who entered the UK from Spain must be isolated for 14 days.
The British tourists who were on a holiday in Spain heard the decision were surprised, worried, and even angry, because the news came suddenly and was untouchable.
The British transport minister, Grant Shapps, is currently on vacation in Spain.
Before the UK issued the isolation measure, Norway has also announced that those returning from Spain to Norway will be subjected to a 10-day isolation.
France and Belgium advise residents to give up their plans for vacation in front of Barcelona and the surrounding areas.
The beaches in these areas are full of suffering, people and people cannot keep social distances, and police once need to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain.
Spain is safe here.
The decision against Britain, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the country's epidemic is under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said: "Spain is safe, not only for the Spanish but also for the tourists."
The Spanish government will try to convince the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in both tourist destinations is much lower than in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Spanish region of Catalonia has also reintroducted a "prohibition order".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most favourite holidays for British tourists.
Britain’s decision is expected to have a significant impact on Spain’s tourism industry.

The engine may burn FAA urgent order to check 2000 Boeing passenger aircraft
The U.S. Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) issued an Emergency Aviation Instruction on 24 May, requiring an emergency inspection of approximately 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft registered in the U.S., due to the fact that the air stop valves of the air passenger aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air after corrosion.
The Federal Aviation Authority said it has received four reports of 737NG and 737Classic passenger engines stationed in the air, and therefore an emergency inspection request was made to check the objects of passenger aircraft staying seven days or more in a row and the number of passenger aircraft flying less than 11 times after reboot.
The Federal Aviation Authority warns that the 5th-level stop valve of all the two engines, if all are corrosed, may be dead at the opening position, resulting in a full loss of power and unable to reboot the engine.
This air regulatory authority orders that once the stop valve is detected corrupted, air operators must replace this key component before the passenger aircraft is re-used.
Boeing responded later that day, the New Crown epidemic resulted in a decrease in the demand for travel, many passenger aircraft were therefore stored or less used, “stop-return valves are more likely to be corrosed.”
Boeing said it has already recommended air operators to check the instructions involved in the passenger aircraft, and if a problem is found, Boeing will provide repairs and replacement of the back valve and so on.
The U.S. Airline that passenger aircraft of the U.S. major airline operators usually fly several times a day, but a large number of passenger aircraft stopped after the New Crown epidemic; as the demand for passengers has recently slowly grown, some passenger aircraft re-in operation.
The Federal Aviation Authority has not published four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed the same incident 24 days later.
The airline operator said in a statement that a passenger plane flown from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas on July 15, a engine suddenly shut down and the passenger plane eventually succeeded in emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it has replaced the motor of the passenger aircraft and has checked the motor of six passenger aircraft according to the Federal Aviation Agency’s instructions.
U.S. airlines, joint airlines and Southwest Airlines said on Monday that the aircraft had no incidents in the fire of the engines connected with the air stop valve.
Four passenger aircraft of the U.S. Airline will be checked and 28 passenger aircraft of the U.S. Airline will be checked.
The airline said it will check 20 passenger aircraft, but there is no indication of whether the engine has been shut down.
A number of media reports that the Federal Aviation Agency’s Emergency Aviation Instruction is another blow to Boeing.
The Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX flight crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
The series of passengers then stopped the flight worldwide, ceasing production in January this year and returning production in May.
In June, Steve Dixon, Director of the Federal Aviation Authority, admitted that the Federal Aviation Authority had “made a mistake” in regulating Boeing on the 737 MAX passenger plane.
“Thanks on the line! teacher good” next week on the line 谢兆丰 title “Knowledge Initiator – New China Network”
There is a new line.
The interactive knowledge-sharing program “King on line! teacher good”, will be broadcast on 20 July in Hunan.
It is understood that the program will build a new full-age youth classroom, a group of colorful and talented teachers will stand up, challenging exciting knowledge output.
Unlike the serious impressions of the former teachers group in the minds of the public, the "Tinking on the line! teacher good" gathers a group of representatives of color and talent and knowledge.
They are both an example of youth knowledge from different disciplines, as well as a group of all-powered "party hands" that will throw the burden and be good to teach the pleasure.
In the program, this group of excellent youth knowledge examples as a “knowledge sharing officer” will challenge a fun knowledge classroom.
They need to attract the audience by attending knowledge output, showing the most interesting side of the discipline in which they are present.
And the entire age audience composed of the "reasonable questionnaire" site will raise a hundred-changing questions, to the "knowledge sharing officer" teaching increases the difficulty, and also to the program add some exciting atmosphere.
It is revealed that in this "knowledge sharing officer" there are Chinese People's University affiliated secondary school physics teacher Li Yong Li, research guidance teacher Zhang Sheng and a decade of practice experience historian teacher Wang Yi, who will in an unexpected way show the audience the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines.
In addition, the program also invited Professor of Economics Zhejiang Feng as the program’s “Knowledge Initiator”, jointly “Gong Assistant Teacher” Du Hai Tao and Zhejiang, to talk to the audience about youth, and to create “All-People Youth Open Classes”.
Hong Kong Special District Government Department Director: The situation is severe All-in-one resistance - China New Network
Hong Kong Special District Government Department Director Zhang Zhang said on 26 July that the Hong Kong New Crown Pneumonia epidemic situation continues to be severe, and if the epidemic disrupts, the Special District Government will be determined to take more strict control measures, further restrict the operations of the operations and reduce the public outdoors.
But at this stage, the government of the Special District does not intend to launch a “home order” or a “prohibition order” to restrict citizens’ exit.
On that day, Zhang Zhang published a web page entitled “Situation is severe and all-power resistance”.
He said the wave is the most severe in six months, and it will be critical for the next two weeks to make every effort to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the Government of the Special District, civil self-discipline and cooperation are also important.
He urged citizens to try to stay at home as much as possible, to reduce social contacts and outdoors.
Citizens should, in conjunction with compulsory measures of wearing masks, protect themselves and others, and focus on personal and environmental health and handwashing, and should, in addition, suspend unnecessary family-friends gatherings or gatherings and reduce to the street market.
He said the center has been deeply concerned about the epidemic changes in Hong Kong and supports the government's anti-epidemic work in the special district, and has been actively responding to the newest demands of the chief executive, to provide assistance in increasing the detection capacity and the reform of the Asian International Exhibition for the work similar to the "quadratic hospital".
Zhang Zhang said that the free virus testing provided by the Government of the Special District for specific high-risk groups, namely Annan House, Disability House and Care House employees, restaurant employees, taxi drivers and property management employees, has been completed, involving up to 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the cases of infection that occurred in the Anno House House, and the Government of the Special District has arranged a specific temporary clinic center for the Anno House House House Friends.
He said the special district government is building isolated sanitation facilities near the Bamboo Bay Inspection Center, which is located in the New Jersey Grand Mountains, and is expected to provide additional 700 isolated rooms by the end of September.

The River Clean Water Show’s “Biboo Dream”
“Godly Yellow River Fujinji”, the Yellow River flowing through Ningji 397 km, is the “Mother River” of one side.
But with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, river lakes development and use and management protection imbalances, excessive emissions, surrounding lakes and fields, invasion of waters and other disturbances appear, leading to the dark smell of the water, excessive water quality, environmental impurities, ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting a variety of water ecological repairs and strives to restore the Yellow River Water Show River Clean.

The Yellow River flowed through Ningxia, along the way formed river wetlands, lakes wetlands, basin wetlands and many other wetlands, which have an important role in promoting the reasonable use of water resources and water ecological balance, while also becoming an international important bird migration pathway.
Since 2009, Ningxia related departments have accumulated investments in moist land protection project funds of approximately 34.5 billion yuan, currently, Xinjiang moist land area is 1.92 million hectares, moist land protection rate reaches 78.5%, there are natural lakes, moist land near 200, has 5 national moist land parks, one national city moist land park, 6 autonomous region level moist land parks, 8 urban level parks.

The family of Lewis: John Lewis is the warrior to fight for the weakest
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was recalled as the “fighting for the weakest” fighter on Saturday (25 July) at a commemoration ceremony for him.
Louis's public memorial begins to be held in Alabama on Saturday.
On the first day there were two memoirs.
On a public memorial on Saturday at the University of Troy, Alabama, the five brothers and sisters of Lewis and a cousin talked about him as a man full of love, fearlessness, and family-weight.
Lewis’ youngest brother, Henry Grant Lewis, said: “He’s all his life committed to helping others.”
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John, “Don’t make trouble, don’t make trouble.”
He added that John did not listen to his mother’s warning, and he said, “We all know that John will always make trouble, always make trouble, but that’s because of keeping the right thing, that’s a good trouble.”
Lewis’ brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial meeting that John’s most famous argument was to create “good trouble,” that is, just for righteousness, to avoid causing things.
John once applied to the Troy University in the town of Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but the University of Troy, which was then a whiten school, rejected his application for admission.
John Lewis, who was a child who preached the gospel to the chicken on his own farm, later graduated from the University of Fisk with a degree in religion and philosophy.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis Honorary Doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones, from Alabama, said the present protesters are “peacefully and nonviolently protesting,” as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: “Even if President Trump has broken down a shipman and calls all the protesters terrorists, he’s wrong.
The protesters are patriots and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country.
A series of six-day events to commemorate Lewis will reach its peak this week at the funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, the tabernacle of Lewis was placed on an open memorial at the University of Troy, where people came to express their gratitude to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony commemorated him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by an open memorial event.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the protesters who demanded black people the right to vote were hit by the Alabama police in front of the bridge, and the police also gave the protesters tear gas.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day was later called the “bloody Sunday.”
Lewis' bodies will be transported to the capital of Alabama, Montgomery.
Mayor Steven Reed encourages people to go on the walk and finish the last journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and keep social distances when participating in the event.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered half-flag on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Lewis.
During almost a week of commemoration, Lewis' bodies will be separated in the Alabama State Parliament Building in Montgomery, in the Georgia State Parliament Building in Atlanta, and in the United States Parliament Building in Washington for a short time to express memories to the public.
U.S. House Chairman Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could visit the U.S. Congress Building on Monday and Tuesday to express respect to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, the public event to remind Lewis will be held outdoors.

According to the request, the school should organize students’ sports activities for more than an hour a day.
For online games, the public security, cultural broadcasting and tourism sports, network regulation, health and other departments should improve the health regulation system of the Internet access services business sites, establish the health review system of online games, and create a good communication space and intercourse culture to promote the healthy growth of teenagers.
In addition, the request was also proposed that influenza patients to go to public places must wear a mask, and health institutions without consent disclose the patient’s privacy fine of 20,000, etc.
It is worth noting that in addition to the physical and mental health of the inhabitants, the request for opinions is also required that the Shenzhen departments in the preparation of planning, regulatory documents and approval of major construction projects and implementation of major public services, including urban space planning and construction, industrial parks planning and construction, resource development use and ecological environment protection, biomedical industry development, and the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population, should be evaluated.
If not assessed or assessed will have a serious adverse effect on the public health of the city or the health of the residents, the implementation shall not be established or approved.

In recent days, General Secretary Xi Jinping, during the visit to the province of Jilin, emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the party, to promote the extension of the party organization to the most basic levels, to improve the work system of the party organization at the basic levels, and to provide a strong guarantee for the urban and rural community governance.
To persist with the building of the party as a leadership, to implement the leadership of the party to the various aspects of the various fields of basic level governance, is the directional fundamental requirement for the work of basic level governance.
To raise the level of governance at the basic level, we must rely on the party building leadership, by strengthening the political leadership, building the fighting fortress, consolidating the red forces, promoting the political advantages of the party, the organizational advantages and the advantages of the work of the crowds to be transformed into the governance advantages, transmitting the party’s strength and claims to the “nerve end” “the last kilometre”.
Focus on supplying calcium and strengthening political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of the basic level of governance, it is necessary to implement the "Calcium Supplement" project well.
It is necessary to take the deep understanding of the socialist idea with Chinese characteristics as the primary task of Xi Jinping’s new era, to take “not forget the first mind, remember the mission” as the party’s building eternal topic and the lifetime topic of the party members and staff members, to strengthen the principles of reading the original literature and literature, to continue to promote the party’s innovative theory and armed minds to realise, to promote the party’s staff members to further enhance “four awareness”, to firmly “four self-confidence”, to do “two maintenance”, to better fulfill their responsibilities.
Through online and underline learning methods, to expand learning education channels, to guide basic party organizations and members of the party personnel to truly integrate learning education into everyday life and take it on frequently.
Focus on practical exercises, in the process of solving the key difficulties in the field of basic level governance, solve the troubles of the attention of the crowd, the troubles of mind, and refines the party and the ability.
Improve the norms and build a battle fortress.
Basic level party organizations are both an important component of the basic level governance system and an important carrier to highlight the governance capacity.
To advance the normalization of the building of the basic party organization, it is necessary to get from taking the work regulations of the party branch, focus on the leadership of the party organization weakening, virtualization and other issues, by establishing the up-to-down connection mechanism, the form of the establishment of the new branch, normalizing the repair of the weak dispersion, establishing a healthy decision-making and negotiation mechanism, serving the mass mechanism, and other ways, to solid foundation, supplement the shortboard, and promote development.
In rural areas, to strengthen the standardization of the organization of the party at the rural level, to contrary to the standardization of the building standards of the party branch, to regulate the form of the organization, learning activities, management mechanisms, to effectively promote the implementation of the system of "three meetings and one class" and the theme of the party day activities.
In the city, focus on the street communities, explore the form of the establishment of the new branch, focus on the weak areas, the blockade and the pain point, actively build the city party alliance, allowing the party’s work to effective coverage.
At the same time, establish a systematic mechanism to improve basic level governance and governance, to improve major consensus, real-life co-operation, important consensus, urgent negotiations, difficult consensus, basic level party organization dominated decision-making and negotiation mechanism, to improve the mechanism to communicate with members of the party, to gather people in the service of the people, to enhance the sense of access, happiness, honour and pride of members of the party, to make basic level governance more warm.
Play a pioneer role, combine the red forces.
Members of the Basic Party are the foundation of the Basic Government.
Increase the governance capacity of the basic level, focus on improving the governance capacity of the members of the basic level of the party, focus on playing the demonstrative lead role of the "red cells" in the basic level of governance, bringing the red forces to the forefront of the contact service masses.
It is necessary to increase the capacity of governance as a mandatory lesson for the basic level of party members, to constantly strengthen the training of thought, professional training, practical training, to develop the spirit of responsibility in this position, urgent and dangerous tasks, to promote the modernization of the state governance system and the capacity of governance, and to contribute to strength and strength.
It is necessary to broadly conduct the activities of “community blows, party members report”, by participating in the theme party day activities, contacting the difficult crowds, determining service projects, recognizing small wishes, submitting reasonable suggestions, and other forms, to participate in community construction, management and service, to allow party members to play a role in community governance.
To fully play the role of rural unemployed party members, through the establishment of unemployed party members’ pioneering positions, the formation of unemployed party members’ working teams, and other ways, to guide the wide range of basic party members to participate actively in the work of defeating poverty, ecological construction, communications and stability, prevention of burning, and better integrate the red forces, to serve the people.
The ground is strong.
Basic party organizations are the ground base of the ruling building.
It is only to persist to bring close party group relations, increase people’s well-being as a point of view, lead the party building as a fundamental way to promote the development of innovation in the basic level of governance, to build a solid foundation, to allow the basic level of party organization to get out, to get up, the basic level of party members can get up, to get up, and to promote the basic level of governance with a “soul”, orderly, strong and effective.

Coca-Cola Tibet Sheep Into Return Season - New China Network
The news agency Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua
The monitoring images near the Five-Down Protection Station show that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan Sheep lead three Tibetan Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep Sheep
Experts analyze that in recent years, the number of Tibetan Shepherds represents one-third to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan Shepherds.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Northwestern Highland Biological Institute’s deputy researcher said: “In the early period of return, Tibetan sheep faces a higher risk of being saved, so the number of puppies in the sheep group will be relatively small, and it may even occur without puppies.
According to the statistics of the Guangzhou National Park Management Director of the Guangzhou Coconut Park Administration, the total number of Tibetan Sheep Returns has increased annually, the number of Tibetan Sheep Returns in 2019 was 4,860, increasing 338 than in 2018.
He said: “It is expected that Tibetan Sheep Returns will end in early September this year, and the number of Tibetan Sheep Returns is still expected to continue to increase.”
The Tibetan Sheep belongs to the national level of animal protection.
Every year at the end of May, Tibetan sheep from Xinjiang, Tibetan Tongue, Xinjiang Algin Mountains and other areas will travel to the Tuna Lake Production, which is located in the backyard of Coca-Cola.
Chinese Tibetan Shepherd Protection Expert, Shenzhen Province Animal Institute (Northwest Endangered Animal Institute) researcher Wu Xiao Dung said: "Tibetan Shepherd Returns is the process of female Tibetan Shepherd after the end of the childbirth, then bringing the childbirth back to habitat. initially leaving the childbirth is a larger return group, but then Tibetan Shepherd will return to their habitat according to different geographical species, along different routes.
In order to ensure the secure return of Tibetan Sheep, the journalists learned that today, the Director of the National Park Management of Jiangsu, the Coconut Park Administration of Jiangsu, has arranged staff in the main return area, continuing to carry out video surveillance and jurisdictional patrol.
If a Tibetan sheep tries to cross the road, the horse crew will take temporary traffic control at first time, making the sheep safe through wildlife passes, ensuring that they are as little as possible disrupted by humans on the way back.
So, how do we get off in everyday life?
Experts recommend that the summer outdoors try to avoid the high temperature periods as possible, it is best not to walk or work under the hot sun after midnight, because this period of time is the strongest sunlight and the likelihood of the heat is higher.
If in this period you have to go out, you must do good protective work, such as covering a parasol, wearing a sunshine, wearing a sunshine, conditionally it is best to apply a sun protection cream to prevent sun injury.
Clothes try to choose light-colored, respiratory good cotton, rubber, silk, less wear fiber clothes, so that a lot of sweat does not dissolve in time, causing heat.
When the high temperature and hot weather, to prepare enough water drink, drink in time, don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once the thirst means the body has already lack of water, every drinking water is controlled at 150 ml to 200 ml, drink warm water, don't drink ice water.
According to high temperatures, general people drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating is more, some salt water can be adequately supplemented to replace the salt that the human body loses due to sweating.
In addition, in the summer, the human body is easily missing, making people feel tired and tired, and tea tea is a great summer drink.
In the summer, eating a lot of water-containing vegetables, such as vegetables, garlic, tomatoes, etc. The fresh fruits, such as potatoes, almonds, garlic, sweets and other water content is 80% to 90%, can be used to supplement water; dairy products can both supplement water and can meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in a high temperature environment should adequately supplement drinks that contain urine, urine and other elements.
The summer day is short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is abundant, the consumption is large, it is easy to feel tired.
A sufficient sleep can relax both the brain and the body’s systems, both beneficial for work and learning, as well as measures to prevent heat.
The best time to sleep is from 22:00 to 23:00, and the best time to wake up is from 5:30 to 6:30.
During sleep, be careful not to lie in the air conditioning outdoor and under the ventilator so that you do not suffer from air conditioning and heat injuries.
Experts recommend that people in outdoor activities or performing high-temperature operations, can carry with them ten drops of water, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium, humanium and humanium.
I hope everyone can take some time considering a very simple fact that, so far, most of our knowledge of the universe comes from light.
We stand on Earth and look at the night sky, and with our eyes we can see the stars in the sky.
The sun is so strong,
We can see the light reflected from the moon,
Since Galileo set his subtle astronomical telescope to target the sky body in the universe, until today, the universe we know is presented in front of us through light.
With the help of the modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to gather spectacular silent cosmic images – this series of images can be backed to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a plot, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you the universe has its own composition, and the universe itself is playing constantly, because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something important happens, it can send a series of sounds to the universe.
Today, we hope to be able to add a voice to this magnificent visual work about the universe.
Although we’ve never heard a sound from the outside space, we should be able to increase the volume and hear what’s going on there in the next few years.
To capture the voice of the universe This extensive goal, we put our focus on the black hole and the prospects it shows, because the black hole can collapse the time space as a bubble collapse the bubble emits a very special sound, and I am also very pleased to play some of the sounds we predict.
One day in the future we may be able to see a shadow a black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but not yet observed.
Although black holes are not seen, they are likely to be heard, because they hit time space like a drum.
The idea that the universe can sound like a drum comes from Albert Einstein, in fact, many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe is empty, if the universe is empty, it would look like this picture, except those painted on the supportive lines above.
But if we are free in the universe, even without these supportive lines, our trails will paint these lines, because we will find ourselves moving along the straight lines, along the untouched straight lines passing through the universe.
Einstein also realized – that’s really the most important part (matter also means “matter”) – that if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe will swallow.
This is Einstein’s great general relativity.
Even the light path will be swallowed.
When it turns to a certain degree it turns around the orbit of the sun’s movement, as the Earth turns around the sun and the moon turns around the earth.
This is the natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn’t realize that if you compress the sun into a 6 km diameter ball—that is, if you compress a 6 km diameter ball of a one million times the matter equivalent to the Earth, you’ll make a black hole that’s so large that if the light is too close to it, it’ll not be able to escape—to leave a huge dark shade in the universe.
But Einstein always thought the black hole was just a mathematical miracle.
He does not believe that there is a black hole.
He believes that nature will prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
Only decades later people began to use the term “black hole” and realized that the black hole is a real existence of the sky – in fact, they are some of the highest-quality stars in the end of their life.
Our sun will not shrink into a black hole.
Its quality is not really large enough.
But if we have done some thought experiments – Einstein loved to do so – we can assume that the sun is shattered after it is compressed within a range of six kilometers and then puts a small earth on the orbit around it, for example, on a orbit 30 kilometers away from the sun.
Earth will shine itself, because now the sun is gone, we have no other source of light – therefore, our small Earth has to shine itself.
You will find that you can even put the Earth on a orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and make it fun running around the orbit.
This black hole is almost as big as Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it might extend to the Hudson Street.
But basically this is what we are discussing.
We discussed an object that was compressed to Manhattan as big as half.
So we move this Earth to a place close to the black hole – 30 km – we notice it runs along the perfect orbit around the black hole.
There are rumors that a black hole will sweat everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to it to really fall into it.
But it is impressive that from our point of view, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
The light issued from Earth, partly falling into a black hole, but another part is seen by us after a black hole is curved.
So you cannot hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the plot of the Space Fortress in Karadika and you are struggling with the Sionists, don’t hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not shrink into a black hole; its quality is not large enough, but there are dozens of thousands of black hole in our galaxy.
If one of them is eating the galaxy, it seems to be like this.
We will see a black hole shade placed on hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy and on the star-lighted dust belt.
If we fall into this black hole, we will see the light being reflected around the black hole, and even when we begin to get into this shadow we will not feel any huge changes are happening quietly.
If we try to launch the rocket and leave there, the result will not be good, because we cannot escape, and even the light cannot escape.
Although the black hole looks dark from the outside, it’s not that from the inside, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the time expansion effect of the relativity, our clock seems slower compared to the time of the galaxy, which seems like the outside galaxy is accelerating changes, just before we ourselves are destroyed by black holes.
It’s like experiencing the feeling of death, you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it’s a complete experience of death.
You can’t tell anyone you’ve seen the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we’ve never seen such a black hole left shadow, but black hole can be heard, even if they’re not seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scene – imagine the two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Per they were formerly a star and then two black holes—every one of them is ten times the quality of the sun.
Now we compress them to within 60 km.
They can turn hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
In a few seconds they can pass thousands of kilometers. In this process, they will not only make the space curved, but also create the vibration of the space in the rear edge, a real existing time-space wave.
The black hole, when it collides with the universe, causes space to be pressed and stretched.
These vibrations spread at the speed of light in space.
This computer simulation was completed by the relative theory group of the National Aerospace Agency Goddard.
It took almost 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes turning around each other, which are the curves imaginary.
As you can see – maybe somewhat confusing – you can see the red waves are launched out, these are gravity waves.
They are the sound of the real universe, and these sounds will spread with the speed of light from these black holes until these two black holes are merged into a quietly rotating black holes.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the pressure and stretch of these spaces.
You can really hear these sounds.
Of course, you will find that your head is also pressed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand what exactly happened.
But I am willing to play for you the voice we predict.
This is the result of my team’s research – a relatively short calculation model.
Imagine a smaller black hole falling into a bigger black hole.
The sounds you hear are from small-quality black holes that collide with space in the process of approaching large-quality black holes.
If they are far away, the sound will be very small.
But gradually the sound becomes like a bubble knocking on space, making space vibrate like a bubble.
We can predict how this sound will be.
We know that in the process of falling, small-quality black holes are getting faster and the sound is also more loud.
Finally, we will hear the small black hole falling completely into the big black hole.
I never thought that sound was so sounding - here it was actually enlarged.
When I heard it at home, I felt that sound was somewhat impotent.
It sounds like, nick, nick, nick.
This is another sound of our research team simulation.
I’m not here to show you the images, because black holes will not leave any useful traces, and the real space will not show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound during the holidays in the universe, I suggest you run quickly.
It is best to get away from this sound.
The two black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they are all trembling strongly.
Then they will be merged together.
That sharp sound is a sign of a black hole merger - a sharp sound will be issued at the end of the merger.
This is what we predict about what we will see.
Fortunately, we are very safe on Long Beach in California.
There is no doubt that somewhere in the universe, two black holes have joined together.
It is also undoubted that the space around us can also feel these vibrations that pass through a million light years, or a million years ago, they spread at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these sounds are so small that we can’t hear at all.
Some experiments in the world will take a lot of heart to build – one of which is a LIGO experiment – which will be able to detect a space vibration at a distance of less than one atomic range every four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be exceeded in the coming years – it will be used to detect space vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to start in the next decade, the project is called LISA.
LISA will be able to see super-growth black holes - those qualities are millions times the sun, even billions times the black holes.
In the images from the Hubble Telescope we see these two galaxies.
They seem to be stable hugging together.
Their center may be a high-quality super black hole.
But they are not stable, they are actually integrating.
The two black holes will collide, and their merger will pass billions of years.
Thus, the accumulation of the sounds they issue has exceeded the limits of our human perception.
But LISA can see the last phase of the two super-growth black holes that began to occur very early, 15 minutes before they were merged.
This discovery is not only limited to black holes, it can also be used to detect any major disturbances in the universe - the largest of which is the disturbance factor "Universal Big Bang".
When the word was created, some people laughed, “Oh, who would believe the great explosion of the universe?”
This animated short film made by a friend of me at Proton Studios shows the scenes of the big explosion from the outside.
We never really want to do that; we want to be placed inside the universe, because there is no such situation outside the universe at all.
So imagine you are in a big explosion.
The universe is everywhere, the world is all around you, and space is rotating irregularly.
14 billion years have passed, and this sound is still around us.
The galaxies gradually form, a group of stars form in the galaxy.On a planet, there is at least one such planet, suitable for life living.
Here we crazyly build experiments, do calculations, write computer codes.
Imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
This sound has always circulated in time space.
We did not even appear here.
It’s getting closer – 40,000 years ago, we still painted on the stone walls of the cave.
If the sound we want to get is issued by the great explosion of the universe, it would sound like that.
Strictly, it is noise.
It’s a white noise, a confusing bell.
But it is everywhere around us, as long as it is not compensated by some other processes in the universe.
If we were able to detect these sounds, it would be like music for our ears, because this quiet feedback comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we lifted up.
So, in the coming years, we will be able to increase the volume of these compositions a little bit, allowing the universe to be presented to us in the form of audio.
But if we are able to detect those early moments, it will also keep us further from understanding the Big Bang, allowing us to pursue some of the most difficult and even the most flattering questions.
If we turn to play the course of the universe, we can know that there has been a big explosion in the past, we can even hear its noise, but is our big explosion the only big explosion in the universe?
I mean we will not be able to ask, have there been such a large explosion before that?
Will it happen again in the future?
I would like to say if we raise the meaning of this question to the level that TED advocates that causes people to re-think, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions that we really might never answer.
But we must ask: Will our universe not be just an insert of a greater history?
Or is it that we are not just a branch of the multi-universe – each branch has experienced its own great explosion – maybe some of them exist a bullying black hole, maybe some no – maybe some existing conscious life, maybe some not existing – they are not our past, nor exist in our future, but in some way connected to us?
So, we can’t stand to guess, if there is a multi-universe, is there life in the other branches of this multi-universe?
This is our life in this multi-universe.
Are there other lives in the multi-universe, and will they also guess our existence, thinking of their own origin?
If so, I could imagine them like us, doing calculations, writing computer codes, building experimental instruments, trying to detect those weak sounds from their origin, and doubt who else was there.
Thank you. thank you all.

Graduate Art Exhibition to the Shop Public Benefit Exhibition - New China Network
During the "Cloud Graduation" season, a difficult underline graduate art exhibition opened warm last weekend.
However, it is not in the art gallery nor in the campus, but appears in the public spaces of Sunshine and is open to the public for free and will last until August 23.
The 2020 Graduate Art Exhibition, which collects 50 works/group of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Chinese Media University and the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, extends the exhibition space from 2 floors to 6 floors, and fully utilizes the interior lamps for the display of flat works, to maximize the art atmosphere of the graduate season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition appears special.
The head of Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao Qingdao
She revealed that the works of this exhibition were collected to the graduates of several major universities of art, and from them selected the suitable for the exhibition of the business space, the work forms from the traditional layer painting, sculpture, to new media devices, interactive animation, VR panorama, size and richness are the most of the years.
In the first battle of 2020, Li Yun-shou expressed his feelings in this epidemic through a mechanical and manual mixture of creative languages; Li Yun-shou explored “cryptocurrencies”, “credit creation”, “trades” and other topics through Ethereum Blockchain creation; Zhang’s “cats” and Chudai’s “cats” are often accompanied by humans, from which young artists can see the understanding of the relationship between humans and animals; and Zhu Yun-shou’s work “Winter of Faith – Gifts” is to remind young people in growth, “when one day a career is done, don’t forget the beginning, remember that part of the purity and truth.”
Among the graduates who have been presented personally for a few, there are Li Hyun from the sculptural department of the Tianjin Academy of Arts.
“I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was a little worried about the epidemic, and three days earlier I did the Nucleic Acid Test, it was with alcoholic cotton and the test report to show up.
His work "Yesterday as a mystery" structure is more complex and must be intimate.
At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping his colleagues repair the damaged work.
“But showed up to four and a half of the morning, then again make repairs, the time was tight, all forgot and the work shade, also a little regret.
He hopes, as the epidemic becomes more stable, again with his colleagues to Beijing to see his work exhibition.

That morning, the 65-year-old Bosonaro posted a photo on Twitter, on which he was dressed in sports shoes, without a mask, sitting in front of a table with a breakfast, with a face with a smile, one hand lifted a big finger, and the other hand lifted a box of chlorine drug.
He wrote on Twitter: “Good morning, new coronavirus test results: negative.”
However, Bosonaro has not stated when the new coronavirus was tested.
On July 5, Bosonaro showed symptoms of new coronary pneumonia, on July 6, he received the results of the virus test positive, on July 7, he via live TV claimed that he was diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia.
On the 14th and 21st of May, Bosonaro was tested for the new coronavirus twice, and the results remained positive.
During the isolation, Bosonaro repeatedly showed via social media the drug he took, and said that thyrocloride was good in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia, it felt good after it was taken, his good condition was due to thyrocloride, claimed Brazilian medical institutions use thyrocloride drugs to treat new coronary pneumonia.
According to Brazilian media, so far, five Cabinet Ministers and ten Governors have been diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia.
A small plane crashed in the Swiss Alps, all four people were killed

CBA welcomes the first group of viewers after the rest of the season, want to see the next season to pay attention to these.
2020-07-26 20:26:01 Source: China News Network Author: 岳川 Responsible Editor: 岳川
According to the official news of the CBA League, the CBA Qingdao competition area today finally welcomed the first group of entrance viewers after the match.
Live viewing fans include Qingdao Mobile staff as well as the crowd of doctors, teachers, public security staff and others who made an excellent contribution to society during the epidemic, on July 31, this season CBA season aftermath officially begins, and then will also officially restore tickets to fans.
As a result of the epidemic, the CBA League began to regain on June 20 after almost five months of interruption.
Although there was little audience on the 26th afternoon, the camping feeling was clear: someone praised and someone silenced.

Australian University develops new drugs expected to be used for the treatment of blood vessels caused by the new crown
Researchers from the University of Monash in Australia are developing a new drug that helps to prevent heart disease and stroke and hopes that the drug will be used to treat blood vessels caused by the new coronavirus.
The researchers found that before a heart disease or stroke, an enzyme in the plaque accelerates the coagulation of the plaque.
Thus, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit blood clots, thereby avoiding blood vessels, and play a preventive role against heart disease and stroke.
The researchers say that this drug only undermines the coagulation effect of the blood clot when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessels are one of the main causes of the deaths of new coronavirus patients, researchers hope this drug can be used in the future for the treatment of such severe patients.
Currently, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The results of the study have been published in the American journal Science and Transformative Medicine.
He became the first audience to enter after the CBA League Resurgence allowed the audience to watch the live game.

The journalist saw this scene on the 25th of May in the Xinjiang Hami city of Yiwu County, Yong Mao Lake town of the Hami Salt Tower Light Heat Power Plant.
The so-called Salt Tower photothermal power generation, is to reflect the sunlight through the lens to the heat absorption to form thermal energy, then through the traditional power generation technology to convert thermal energy into electric energy.
Zhang Wang, Chief Executive Officer of Qingdao Hami Solar Thermal Power Limited, said that its design principle is similar to the solar straw used in rural areas in the northwestern region of China, and it is necessary to gather the sunlight together.
The power plant began its construction in October 2017, and at the end of last year it achieved a network of 6,600 hectares, with a total of 14,500 plants planned to be installed.
Compared to traditional solar power generation technology, its greatest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy, and it can also produce electricity at night.
Zhang said that the project’s 13 hour heat storage system, which allows the generator to maintain continuous and stable operation, is not affected by light light changes; it can also, according to the power grid loading valley demand, quickly participate in the power grid summit.
After the project is fully completed, it can an annual electricity production of 1.98 billion degrees, can save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, decrease emissions of more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxide, about 20 tons of dust, more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide local sources of constant clean energy.
In addition, there is another silver "to Sunshine" in the Hami City Stone Town photovoltaic industrial park.
Hamifer solar photovoltaic power plant covers more than 2,300 hectares, 714 electricity generating equipment has been built to follow the sun's rotation, always keeping the sunlight and the polypropylene panels in a 90 degrees straight corner.
“We use dual-axis tracking polyphoto power generation technology, through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust according to the sun’s altitude angle,ining power efficiency.
The power plant’s long-stage Monsieur said that in light-light weather conditions, the technology of generation of electricity more traditional photovoltaic power efficiency can increase by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power plant has achieved more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shenzhen photovoltaic industrial park is currently the largest single-size, the most complete of the type of photovoltaic components, a photovoltaic industrial demonstration park, all included 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, total installation machinery of 820,000 kW.
The completion of electricity production in the first half of this year exceeds 1.1 million degrees, a 6% increase compared to the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best conditions for solar resources in China.
The average total solar radiation per year is more than 6200 megapixels per square meter, and the number of sunlight hours throughout the year is approximately 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has strongly developed the photovoltaic industry, cultivating good "to Sunshine".
More than 2.5 million kW of solar power has been built, and the city's photovoltaic power generation in the first half of this year exceeds 1.4 billion degrees, compared to an increase of about 14%.
Currently, Xinjiang joins more than 330 fotovoltaic power plants, the installation capacity exceeds 10 million kW.
This year, photovoltaic energy production is expected to reach 15 billion degrees, which can replace more than six million tons of standard coal.

U.S. media reveals the truth that the U.S. is unrighteously asking China to close the General Consulate in Houston
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Central View Network Author: Zhu Yong Tian Responsibility Editor: Zhu Yong Tian
U.S. media revealed the truth of the unjustified U.S. requesting China to close its headquarters in Houston
On 24 May, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China decided to withdraw the creation and operation of the U.S. General Consulate, and specified demands to the General Consulate to stop all operations and activities, as a countermeasure against the U.S. on 21 May suddenly demanded by China to close the General Consulate in Houston.
The behavior of the U.S. government has raised a lot of concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scientists.
Why does China demand the closure of the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said it is not clear why the United States would choose China's General Consulate in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media stated straightforward: for the general election.
The U.S. Cable Television News Network (CNN) on Thursday that the action of the U.S. to ask China to close the General Consulate in Houston raised public question of its political motives.
The U.S. government's catastrophic response to the New Crown epidemic has led to a relatively low support rate for President Trump's poll before the election.
White House officials privately said the strong strategy against China was to save Trump’s support rate and to transfer the responsibility of the White House’s epidemic to failure.
According to the article, China’s General Consulate in Houston is a “politically driven, very cautious” target chosen by the U.S. government, which is “to create a strong attitude while avoiding the risk of causing major conflicts.”
The British Broadcasting Company (BBC) also believes that in the upcoming U.S. election season, when the U.S. economy is seriously affected by the epidemic, Trump believes that “playing a ‘China card’ has a political advantage.”
The current situation is a “spiral upward, sharp-relative struggle”, which is to a certain extent driven by the U.S. government from a domestic consideration point of view, and will only worsen the tensions between China and America.
The American Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS) that Trump's re-election prospects were under pressure due to the epidemic, and he has repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
The U.S. almost every day takes new actions against Trump’s so-called “China exploits America” absurd argument.
“The General Consulate of Houston is very important in establishing relations between the two countries.”
The U.S. calls for China to close its headquarters in Houston to intensify tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate in Houston is closed, China’s citizens in the south of the United States will face difficulties in accessing consular services, and the US citizens seeking visa and other services will also face difficulties.
A Houston business group regretted the U.S. requesting China to close the General Consulate in Houston, saying the General Consulate plays an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The U.S. Federation believes that this reflects the importance of China’s economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine said the action “is part of a series of provocative initiatives that will only deteriorate the U.S. and China relations.”
Jonathan Polak, an expert on Eastern Asia, said that since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the two countries in 1979, he has not thought any action could be compared to the U.S. action against the Chinese Consulate in Houston.
The Hong Kong South China Morning newspaper that the action of the U.S. side is unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Analysts believe that this move may result in permanent damage.
The General Consulate of China in Houston was established in 1979 and is the first General Consulate of China opened in the United States.
Currently, China has a US embassy and five consulat.

UK Embassy spokesman: Chinese government is a solid defender of cybersecurity
According to the site of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, on 25 July, the spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the UK replied to the journalists about the mistake of cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a firm defender of cybersecurity and is constantly strongly opposing and fighting any form of cyber attacks and cyber crime.
A journalist asked: The media that hackers related to China had interfered with a British company’s network system, attacked a British-American technology company with patent data, and invaded the EU government networks.
The spokesman said the Chinese government is a firm defender of cybersecurity and is constantly strongly opposing and fighting any form of cyber attacks and cyber crime.
Web space is virtually strong, back source hard, behavior diversity, when investigating and qualitative web events should be given sufficient evidence, not unreasonable guessing.
According to the spokesman, a series of events, such as the Early Mirror Gate, demonstrates that the United States has been carrying out the world’s largest cybersecurity operations.
Maintaining peace and stability in the cyberspace is in common interest for all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China’s achievements in the field of technology and innovation are not stolen, not stolen, but through self-regeneration and hard struggle.
In 2019, China submitted approximately 590,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Agreement (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, becoming the country with the highest number of international patent applications.
China has become a power of innovation and intellectual property.
China’s People’s Bank’s Urumqi Center’s data show that in the first half of the year, Xinjiang’s additional loans for agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprises exceeded the yearly increase in 2019.

Urumqi Free Nucleic Acid Testing Majority of the areas have essentially completed High-Risk Area for Second Testing.
Zhang Wai, Director of the Urumqi City Health and Health Committee, said on 26 July, when informing the latest epidemic and nuclear acid testing in Urumqi City, that at the moment, the majority of the free nuclear acid testing work in Urumqi City has been completed.
The State Council Expert Group and the Autonomous Region and Urumqi City Experts are making further evaluation of the epidemic development based on the nuclear acid testing and epidemiological investigation results.
The news office of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region held a press conference on Monday to inform the Xinjiang epidemic and prevention.
According to him, on July 25 at 0:00 to 24:00, Urumqi City added 22 new cases of confirmation of coronary pneumonia (five of which were transmitted in cases of non-symptomatic infections) and 38 new cases of non-symptomatic infections.
As of July 25th, 24h, there were 135 cases of confirmed diagnosis in Urumqi City and 147 cases of non-symptomatic infection.
The newly added non-symptomatic infected people were also essentially tested through the entire city’s free nucleic acid testing and initiative screening.
Chief of the Urumqi City Health and Health Committee, Zhang Wai, said on Monday that the majority of the districts of Urumqi City’s free nuclear acid testing work has been completed.
He also said, from the experience of other regions of the country, there are many factors affecting the test results, such as the sensitivity of the test material, the time of infection and the time of detoxification of the tested person, the condition of the tested person when sampling material (compatibility difference may lead to the sample not being placed) and the environment of the test, the operating skill of the test person, etc.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid testing can also result in false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the detected person is actually an infected person, but the nuclear acid test results are negative.
In addition, for those who have been in close contact with confirmed cases and suspicious cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to be eliminated.
For people who have gone to high-risk areas of epidemic, if there are fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid detection may be false negative, so it also takes two nucleic acid detection to eliminate.
He said, taking into account the above circumstances, for the health of the entire city's ethnic crowds, from today, Urumqi City will carry out a second free nuclear acid testing on the main areas such as the Sky Mountains and the Shayibak district, and at the same time carry out a "check-up deletion".
It is that the Sky Mountains and Shayibak are high-risk areas of epidemic.

Brazilian studies show that chlorine is ineffective in the treatment of low-corrheic pneumonia.
Recently, a Brazilian study has shown that chlorine is ineffective in patients with lymphocytosis.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups, conducting clinical trials, mainly comparing the therapeutic effects of individual use of thyrocloride or combination of other antibiotics with Archipelin, analyzing whether it helps to improve the condition of new coronary pneumonia in slight and moderate patients.
The results showed that thyroid chloride not only did not have a therapeutic effect, but may have harmful side effects on the pollutants.
The study was completed by several Brazilian authority hospitals such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Heart Disease Hospital (HCor) and Hospital Sírio-Libanês in Syria (Hospital Sírio-Libanês) in conjunction with the Brazilian Clinical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Heavy Disease Surveillance Research Network (BRICNet).

U.S. trade representatives meet in August
The Hong Kong South China Morning newspaper quoted an anonymous informed person reports that the chief of the China trade negotiation team, Deputy Prime Minister Liu Huang and the joint leader of the U.S. team, and trade representative Rai Haizhou are expected to hold official talks in August to evaluate the situation of the two sides fulfilling the first stage trade agreement between China and the United States.
Although China has significantly increased the number of purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the New Crown Virus epidemic, the number of purchases by China is still a distance from the number promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say the recent US-Chinese closure of each other's consulates, along with other disputes, could ruin any progress of the two sides in trade.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States enters into force one month after the signing on 15 January, and the agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group of the two sides should hold a meeting every six months.
Interested persons said the meeting would be a "important shift point" for the two sides to evaluate the progress of the agreement.
But he also said that if tensions between the U.S. and China lead to a low desire for talks at this time, the two sides may agree that the telephone meeting of May 8 with Liu Liu has met the terms of talks once every six months in the trade agreement.
Since this year, China and the U.S. relations have been rapidly deteriorating, and disputes between the two sides include a series of issues including the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, South Sea and ideology.
Although U.S. President Trump spoke about his achievements in the first phase agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a press conference in the White House on 23 May that while China recently broke the record number of U.S. corn purchases, it also bought a lot of soya, “this trade agreement is now meaningless to me than it was at the time it was reached.”
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place due to the poor U.S.-Chinese relations, and that “trade issues have lost scores in the U.S. relations.”
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units were still meeting on 23th to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have made our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Vice-President of the U.S. and China Trade National Committee, Penceen, said thatining the first phase of the agreement is "more important than ever before" and said China has made progress this year in further opening the financial markets to U.S. companies.
An analyst from the independent research company Plenum says: “Talk is better than not talking, although it may only be considered a regular work.”
The Ministry of Emergency Management informed that the Ministry of National Defense and Emergency Management today will with the National Food and Materials Reserve Bureau again urgently transport 13.5 million tissue bags, 1.2 million square meters of tissue, 130,000 square meters of grass, and 6 categories of central reserve anti-threatening materials to Anjou, supporting Anjou anti-threatening risks rescue work.
According to the relevant officials of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at the moment, Longjiang downstream and Qingjiang flood areas maintain high water level volatility, "Longjiang 2020 No. 3 flood" formed on the 26th of Longjiang upstream, local regional risks increased.
The meteorological department is expected that in the next three days there will be strong rainfall in Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Longjiang suburbs, and the prevention situation remains severe and complex.
The Ministry of Emergency Management has since deployed a national comprehensive fire rescue team to the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front.

“As for recent IPO cases and the situation of the companies that are going to enter the U.S., the U.S. IPO is essentially not affected, but now the market is very good, even now this time point is the best time point for Chinese companies to enter the U.S. IPO in the past 10 years.
Nasdaq Securities Exchange’s Chief Representative of China Region, Huong Zheng, said at the “Snowball 2020 Summit Leaders’ Summit”.

The statement states that while international cooperation and coordination have grown significantly in recent years, the U.S. regulatory issues on access to information continue to exist, and SEC and PCAOB are still facing legal and practical challenges; according to the document, the PCAOB website provides a detailed list of listed companies with auditing barriers and its auditing bodies, with a large number of CCP companies listed.
Moreover, in May this year, the Senate of the United States approved the Foreign Companies Responsibility Act, requiring additional information disclosure for Foreign Companies listed in the United States.
According to Huawei, the central stock crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
“This news just came out to panic everyone, everyone was asking if the future could still go to the U.S. market, but later we found these questions are not a matter on the side of investors, investors may ask these questions when they recently go to the U.S. IPO, even become a matter of standardization, but this is not considered by investors as an important factor to invest and not invest in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that people look at the current situation with a normal mind as possible.
Of course, this surface may seem to be the worst situation in the past two years, but it has not been affected by any interest in the investor’s appetite.
So from now to the end of this year or before the U.S. elections, the heat to the U.S. IPO will continue.
On May 9, this year, Qingdao was officially listed in the US NASDAQ, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the U.S. IPO after the epidemic.
“Kingshan Cloud’s listing gives a great confidence to the Chinese company preparing for the IPO behind.
He said.
In the first half of 2020, Snowball published a summary share data report showed that in the first half of this year, the US IPO China enterprises were in a total of 20, compared to the same period last year, a growth of 17.6%; in terms of the initial funding total, 20 enterprises were funding of 27.25 billion, compared to the same period last year, a recovery of more than 52.4%; in the industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the healthcare industry in the first half of this year was highlighted, compared to the same period last year, a growth of 100%.
According to Huawei, Chinese companies that travel to the U.S. IPO in the first half of this year are of high quality, with hard basic and growing quality companies, will be more able to get the preference of investors.
From a short, medium and long-term point of view, Huawei continues to be optimistic about Chinese companies traveling to the U.S. IPO.
“In the short term, the hot flows of going to the U.S. IPO are still ongoing; in the medium term, the Chinese companies have more choices, A stock, port stock, US stock, all will take the U.S. elections and the U.S. relations as market choices and time choices consideration factors; in the long term, everything will return to normal, market volatility is a cycle, both political cycle and economic cycle, will eventually return to the normal stage, the stock market is always a volatility forward.
“This year, uncertainty factors are much more, but for quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have the growth that can make investors see, the other factors are relatively secondary, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies.

People's Daily Reviewers: Concentrate Forces to Do Your Own Things Create New Advantages for Future Development - - About Learning to Implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's Important Speech at the Entrepreneur Meeting - New China Network
Xinhua Agency Beijing July 25 Telegraph People's Daily July 26 Commentary article: Concentrate strength to do your own things Building new advantages of future development
Currently, the global epidemic and the global economic situation are still seriously complex, and the challenges of our development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, strengthening confidence and concentration of strength to do our own things are the key to addressing various risks.
At the entrepreneurial conference held in recent days, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in the current environment of protectionism rise, the world economy is low, the global market crash, we must concentrate our strength to do our own things, fully play the domestic super-scale market advantages, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the subject, domestic international double cycle mutual promotion, increase the level of modernization of the supply chain of the industrial industry, strongly promote technology and technology innovations, accelerate key core technology connections, create future development new advantages.
The winner is the winner, the winner the winner.
In the external environment of the deep development of economic globalization, markets and resources "two head out" played an important role in the rapid development of China.
Now, the world under the epidemic is experiencing profound changes, facing more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing reverses and reverses.
To be prepared for a long time to respond to the changes in the external environment and to work prepared, to drive the economy of China to breathe and move towards stable, one of the very important aspects is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic needs as a strategic basis for development, to fully play their own advantages, to increase the dynamic for the economic development of China through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the flexibility of the domestic cycle, and to drive the global economic recovery.
We must be deeply aware that building a complete internal demand system relates to our long-term development and long-term security.
The Central Court of Justice of the Party clearly proposed a firm implementation of the expansion of the internal demand strategy, which is the need to respond to the epidemic shock, the need to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of our economy, and the need to meet the growing and better life of the people.
The advantage of the economy is the internal circulation.
China has the world’s most comprehensive, largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect support capacity, has more than 100 million marketers and more than 1,7 million people with higher education or various professional skills, and the 1.4 billion inhabitants, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, form the super-scale domestic demand market, is in the new type of industrialization, information, urbanization, and agriculture modernization rapid development phase, investment demand is huge.
The socialist basic economic system, such as the socialist market economy system, can both stimulate the vitality of the market subjects, liberate and develop social productivity, and can promote efficiency and equal organic unity, and constantly common wealth.
We must strictly understand this strategic basis to expand domestic demand, to make the production, distribution and circulation areas more dependent on the domestic market to a good cycle, to clarify the strategic direction of structural reforms on the supply side, to promote total supply and total demand to a dynamic balance at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete internal demand system, strongly promote technology and technology innovations and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the advancement of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, smart manufacturing, life health, new materials, form more new growth points, growth pits, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the subject, domestic international double cycle mutually promoting.
Opening brings progress and closure must be behind.
Secretary-General Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that China’s open doors will not be closed, but will only be increasingly opened.
The main objective of the domestic cycle is not to close the doors to close operations, but to make the domestic and international markets better connected by playing the potential of domestic demand, and to better exploit both domestic and international markets, and to more strong and more sustainable development.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and expanding openness are not contradictory, the smoother the domestic cycle, the more beneficial for the construction of a new pattern of openness, the more beneficial for the formation of new advantages of participation in international cooperation and competition.
While international protectionism is now rising, we must stand on the right side of history, persist to deepen reforms, expand the opening, strengthen open cooperation in the field of technology, promote the construction of an open world economy, and promote the construction of a community of human fate.
The Chinese nation has suffered a lot of suffering in history, but has never been defeated, but increasingly defeated and courageous, continuously growing in suffering, rising from suffering.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Central Party, which is in the core of the fellow Xi Jinping, with the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, with the strong mobilization capacity and strong comprehensive strength, with the unity of the people of all the peoples of the whole Party, we will surely be able to overcome all the difficult obstacles, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development of China, fully build a small and prosperous society, and successfully open the new journey of the whole construction of the socialist and modern state!
The rest of the treasury earnings fall down "90 after" instead of "vengeance" savings?
With the rest of the treasury revenue down, “90 after” not only didn’t escape the rest of the treasury, but instead began to “vengeance” savings?
The China New Economic Institute Joint Payment Bank (China New Economic Institute) published today’s “Resteau 90 After Savings Report” (2020 edition) shows that in the first half of the year, “90 After” preferred savings: the amount of savings per person grew almost forty per cent compared to 2019.
Interestingly, "90 after" is more likely to start saving from a "small money", with an average of 60 per cent of the savings amount below 20 yuan.
Saving money with the rest of money, also becomes the “90 after” savings habit.
The data shows that of the remaining 700 million users, 1.34 billion users are "90 after".
China has 1.74 billion "90 after", that is, about three of every four "90 after" in the country are saving money with the remainder.
Currently, the seven-day annual revenue rate of the currency funds, such as the rest of the currency, dropped from the level above 2% at the beginning of the year to about 1.5%.
Even so, it does not affect the pace of "90 after" saving money.
And on the background of the “saving money effect” increase, many young people who are used to use the “saving money” are also directly converted to “city people”.
Payment Treasury data show that by July 13, the new “city people” on payment treasury over a month increased more than twice, and more and more young people achieved “progress” money on payment treasury.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the remainder to the stock market is also an important reason for the June monetary funds’ share to decline clearly.
The report also shows that "90 after" girls tend to save more money, an average of two percent higher than boys; 6 percent of users holding funds on the payment platform are men, and women tend to choose a more stable way of funding than men.
What is the “90” plan after saving money?
Payment Treasury data show that "90 after" has the habit of saving money for the target, putting travel as the most money-saving target users.
Affected by the epidemic, many “90s” save money to prepare for the after-epidemic journey; the cinema restartes its operations and also provides new ways to switch from saving money to consumption.

France Increases Space Military Investment - New China Network
French Defence Minister Florence Pali said on Wednesday that France will add hundreds of millions of euros in space defence budget to develop space military forces to prevent other countries from taking "non-friendly actions" outside space.
At the same day, Pali told the Provence newspaper that between 2019 and 2025, the French military spacecraft expenditure budget will increase from the previously planned €3.6 billion (approximately $4.2 billion) to €4.3 billion ($5 billion).
According to the French parliament’s 2018 approved Law on Military Planning for 2019-2025, France is expected to upgrade existing observation satellites and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic detection satellites, and increase the level of modernization of space monitoring radars.
In July, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that the French Air Force will establish a Space Military Command and "Air and Space Forces".
Pali said she would officially announce the creation of the spacecraft when she later visits a military school in the area of Saloon in Provence.
Pali said the space force belongs to the Air Force, preparing up to 500 people by 2025.
She said: “There was a thought that space served the common interests of science, and this idea has never returned, and now space is the place where countries struggle for global hegemony.”
Pali reiterated Macron's previous statements, saying France does not intend to trigger a weapons race.
“We are not going to run a weapons race, but I have the responsibility to fully recognize the threats we might face.”
Pali reiterates the incident in which a military satellite shared by France and Italy was monitored in 2017.
She said the “spyware” was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this statement.
Pali said France will "in a short time" have a small patrol satellite capable of detection and locking "those hands behind unfriendly behavior".
The French media believes that France is seeking to establish a space force because US President Donald Trump in February last year asked the U.S. Department of Defense to draft a law on the creation of a space force.
In December last year, Trump signed a National Defence Authorization Act approving the establishment of the sixth-largest U.S. Army – the Space Force.
Some experts are concerned that the U.S. actions have accelerated the pace of U.S. space militarization and could lead to a new round of space weapons competition.

Experts say the collection of immigration data through the U.S. population census is used for unconstitutional allocation of seats in the House of Representatives.
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties have appealed against the U.S. Federal Government, saying the Trump Presidential House attempts to exclude uncertified immigrants outside of the U.S. population census are unfunctional and unconstitutional.
The U.S. population census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brandon, Executive Lawyer of the American Civil Rights Freedom Alliance, said to the Voice of America, “It’s impossible to do so.”
She said that it was difficult to ask Trump to determine the citizenship of the person who received the census in the census, and that it was "not very reliable."
Another civil-liberal joint affairs organization raised a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump’s administrative order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia have joined the lawsuit.
The Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the trial on Friday.
Gavi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Arlington County, said: “The U.S. Constitution requires accurate clearance of our population every 10 years.We must accurate clearance of everyone who lives in the Arlington County and not allow this illegal attempt to scare people and compress the number of our immigrant communities to succeed.
Other organizations and individuals have praised President Trump’s administrative order.
Alabama's Justice Minister Marshall said the administrative order was a state's "victory."
He said, "When allocating the seats in the House of Representatives and the seats in the Electoral Committee of the States, it must be based on the number of residents living in the States and the number of residents legally living in the States."
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court banned Trump’s administration from adding citizenship to the 2020 population census.
Earlier this week, President Trump signed an administrative decree that ordered the U.S. Population Census Secretary of Commerce, Ross, to submit data on the uncertified population income in order for the administrative authorities to exclude these uncertified population from the population census of the states, determining whether each state is actually increasing or decreasing orining the seats of the House of Representatives.
The U.S. will replace the seats in the House of Representatives every ten years, depending on the change in population.

The Ministry of Propaganda of the Provincial Committee and the Ministry of Propaganda of the Provincial Committee, Zhang Makrosen, announced the opening of the Red Tourism Culture Festival, and the Deputy Governor, Wu Guing, spoke.
The Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival has been successfully hosted 16 times, and is a famous brand of national red tourism.
This festival is jointly organized by the Ministry of Propaganda of the Provincial Committee, the Provincial Culture and Tourism Hall, and the City Government of the Shanghai City Committee.
Wu Guing said that the organization of this festival, for the implementation of the important instructions of the Secretary-General Xi Jinping "to use the red resources well, to develop the red tradition well, to inherit the red genes well", to further catch the development of the red tourism in my province, to promote the recovery of the tourism market, to make the "red force" gathered into the building of the widespread joint power of the rich and beautiful and happy New Hunan.
In order to promote the red culture, to inherit the red spirit, to stimulate the consumption and to promote the high-quality development of the Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi Hanoi.
At the opening ceremony, the two events of the Red Dance Invitation Competition, "Red Moving Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva
During the festival, there will also be the promotion and signing ceremony of Shanghai Industrial Project Contractors, Red Tourism Five Good Interpreters Forum and Red Education Training Seminars, Red Intelligence Travel Experience Exhibition and New Technology Sharing, "Shanghai Water Co-Source, Culture Co-Source" Hunan Mountain Song Invitation Competition and other activities.
During the opening ceremony, Zhang Makroson, Wu Guing and other leaders and guests went to Shanghai's first Red Culture Industry Exhibition for a live tour, and watched "China came out a Mao Zedong" scenic performance.
As an artist, contact is very important to me.
Through my artwork I try to clarify that mankind is not separated from nature, but that every thing is connected to one another.
About ten years ago I went to Antarctica for the first time, and I also saw the ice mountain for the first time.
I feel scared.
My heart flows quickly, my head blows, and I try to understand what this is exactly in front of me.
I can only feel strange that this is a snowflower covered in another snowflower, which is formed year after year.
The formation of ice mountains is when they break from the glaciers or break from the glaciers.
Each ice mountain has its own unique personality.
They have a clear way of interaction with their surrounding environment and their circumstances.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and end up, while other icebergs can’t tolerate the collapse of the water.
When you see the Ice Mountains, it’s easy to think they’re all isolated, they’re independent, unified, more like our humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But reality is far more than this.
As the ice mountain flourishes, I breathe to its old smell.
As the ice mountains flourish, it releases fresh water rich in minerals and they feed everything.
I started to photograph these icebergs as if I was photographing the portraits of my ancestors, learning that in these individual moments the icebergs existed in this way but will never exist again in this way.
When they flourish, it is not death; it is not a end, but a continuation of the way to life.
I’ve photographed the ice mountains, some of the ice is very young—a few thousand years old.
Some ice is over a hundred thousand years old.
The last picture I want to show you is a ice mountain I’ve taken on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
This is a very difficult opportunity for everyone to actually see a mountain of ice rolling.
So this is as shown in the picture.
On the left you can see a small boat.
It is a boat of about 15 feet.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the ice mountain it is deformed on the water.
Here you see it begins to roll, the small boat moves to the other side, and a man stands there.
This is an average size of the Greenland ice mountain.
It floats out of the surface of the water about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
The video was taken in real time.
(Music) Like this ice mountain, they show everyone the different aspects of their personality.
thank you.

China New Network Xinjiang Hainan July 26 Telegraph Topic: Xinjiang Lake "Floor Sea Live Broadcast": "Sweet" with cargo aid farmers added revenue
Author 胡贵龙 潘雨洁
On the shore of the Lake, full of eyes, gold flowers, mill bees dance, here the height is high, day and night temperature is big, air pollution is less, strong lighting has grown the strongest, generous bees, created the high-activity, high-protein, rich in nutritional value, low-sugar low-fat characteristics.
On 26th, the Deputy Director of the Industrial and Information Administration of the Tibetan Autonomous State of Hainan, Qinghai, said.
At the same day, the live broadcast of bees products was held on the shore of Xinjiang Lake, China Bees Products Association and entrepreneurs representatives, bees farmers and many sides gathered together to promote Xinjiang Bees products, under the line total sales of ten thousand bottles of Xinjiang Highland Bees Powder, carrying the total amount of 3.8 million.
The picture shows bees products for the bees farm site.
It is that this live broadcasting carrier activity, through the network of Beijing Dongguan Bee Industry chain stores, fast-hand, Tomb Raider and other domestic well-known bees products retail enterprises, live broadcasting, e-commerce platforms, promoted the "Business + Bee Farmers + Farmers" communication cooperation, and through the online and underline channels continuously issuing to consumers "Xianghai Gongguan Bee Consumption Tickets", the company is expected to make the total profit of 5.28 million euros throughout the year.
In this regard, the President of Beijing Dongguan Bee Industry Co., Ltd. believes “very worth it”: “This move can expand the awareness of Xinjiang bees products, attract more consumers to know, like without adding pure natural bees products, and drive bees farmers to increase their earnings.
Currently, the company has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Limited and Qinghai Flower Bee Industry Co-operative Company, hoping to jointly promote the development of Qinghai local bee industry.
Picture is the oil fruit of the sea on the shore.
This spring, all over the world due to the prevention of the epidemic need to set the road passage barrier, the road of the bees farmers "drawing for honey" is blocked, many bees die due to missing the period of flowering, lack of food, the bees farmers' income is seriously affected.
“At the end of the year, the bees farmers followed the long-term journey, from Yunnan, Sichuan and the way to the north to the north-west area, their wind food accommodation, living without place, very hard.
As a business, we have the responsibility to help them.
She said.
“Little bees are ‘environmental detective troops’, polluted areas of bees cannot survive, and China Bee Products Association’s permanent vice president, Zhao Xiaoku, introduced that bees powder is an important part of the ecological chain, and has an unalternative role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bees pollution can make the cultivation of crops increased, especially in areas with widespread and poor management conditions, and pollution is more important.
Study data show that powdering can increase oil grains production by about 15 - 30%.

The economic, ecological and social benefits of bees powder are far greater than the value of the bees products themselves, and the bees industry has a huge potential for human health, plant production, plant reproduction, and ecological protection, and people have always known very little about it.
Zhao Zhao said.
And today, the number of beekeepers is increasingly reduced, and in addition to the beekeepers who go out all year round, there are still many uncomfortable actors who choose to share with the beekeepers.
“The state has financial support, we contact technicians to help guide, bees farmers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment, to open the sales path also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, industrial associations.
Zhao Zhao said.
“I hope everyone will pay more attention in the future and help the bees group,” Zhina said, “Our bees products are also strictly selected and controlled according to national standards, guaranteeing quality, while helping bees farmers while protecting consumer rights and interests.
Under the influence of continued rainfall, since July 22, Chongqing Wulong area land and rural six井村 central square crossing backyard ground breaking, a large area of sliding transformation occurred, completely blocked along the river, formed the water level 13 meters before the dam, estimated the water capacity of the warehouse of about 550,000 meters cubic meters.

International Milan to open the 3,000th Italian competition
In the morning of the 26th of July, Beijing time, the Italian traditional Houston International Milan welcomed a milestone battle.
According to Italian media statistics, the guest field against Ghana is the 3000th Italian League in Milan's history, and the Blue Black Army is also the first team to unlock this trail.
Since the League Reform in 1929, Milan has been the only team that has never been absent and the only team that has never been lowered.
According to Italian media, the match between Milan and Ghana is the 3,000th match in the history of the Blue Black Army team.
During this flight, Milan's international guest stadium won three goals against Geneva.
The role was opened by Luca Kumay twice, and Sanchez, who replaced the match, also contributed a goal.
The match started in the rhythm of International Milan from the beginning, and the force ended up turning into a goal in the 34th minute.
Belaghi is on the left side, and Lukasco is on the middle side to break the headball.
In the 82nd minute, Milan is like a gun system, Mossi's right-hand breakthrough is in the aftermath, Sanchez's middle-hand pack is well pushed; before the end, Lukaku finishes the second degree of Meiji, reverses in Brozovich sends the long-distance straight, Lukaku enters the prohibited area after pushing over Romeo, the score will be fixed at 3:0.
International Milan hostel 3:0 defeated Geneva, points against Atlanta rose to the 2nd, in the case of a multi-match leaving behind the lead sheep Juventus 4 points, still retains the crown hope.
At this point, in this 3,000 Italian leagues, which crossed almost 90 spots, Milan won 1,489 of them, matched 834 matches, lost 677 matches, with a win rate of 49.6%.

According to a statement, the drone crashed within the territory of Libya when the Israeli military carried out missions near the "Blue Line" on the Israeli-Liban border.
The statement did not mention the cause of the drone crash.
Israeli media reports that the drone could have crashed due to a failure.
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gantz said that Israel will continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long seen the Hezbollah in Lebanon as a major security threat and accuses Iran of shipping weapons to the Hezbollah in Lebanon through the Syrian coastal corridors and is stressed by the situation near the Liban border.
Israel has repeatedly carried out airstrikes on targets in Syria.
Spy war drama old face Liu Yonglong plays a tough man protagonist - New China Network

The story tells the subterranean party member of the CPC, Don Fei (Liu Yonglong), who was hidden in the Japanese police station, a joint Soviet agent, who killed the head of the Japanese agent, and broke the Japanese army's terrible conspiracy.
Based on historical modifications, the material was taken from the Soviet military archives for many years.
During the Moscow Defence War, the Soviet Red Army advanced to the Far East and the East, and at this time the Japanese Guangdong Army "Northern Defence" considered it organic and willing to leave the army.
In order to resolve the enemy threat, the CPC and Soviet intelligence personnel jointly implemented the "Mudanula" program.
Based on this historical background, the famous writer Deng Deng has repeatedly melted, causing the drama to break the brain.
Liu Yunong this time at the same time served as supervisory and male protagonist in the Victory.
In the drama, he plays Don Fei is the Chief Criminal Coach of the Lin River Police Hall, a pleasant and even a little crazy Cuban police officer, the real identity is a CPC subterranean party member.
The protagonist of the game, Zaymon, is the head of the Lin River Safety Bureau, deeply appreciated by the Japanese boss, and there is also an enemy and friendly, unclear, delicate relationship with Don Feng.
In recent years, Suu Kyi has tried a lot of different types of roles, from “These Years We’re Young” to “Long Years” to “Long Years” to “Long Years” to “Long Years” to “Long Years” to “Long Years” to “Long Years” to “Long Years” to “Long Years”.
This time, Suu Kyi and Liu Yunong were the first partners, and the Chief of Police of Zuba combined with the setup of Zuba's female police, quite a point of view and a new idea.
In addition to the two main characters, in "Winning" there are also a lot of power party actors joining Liu Crown, Li Liu Group, Changbo, Rayhan, Shenzhen, and other, the play is also one of the points of view of the drama.
It is understood that the production of "Win count" is also very good, and the drama group crosses Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning 3 provinces for 2,000 kilometers of shooting.
In order to restore the ancient North-Eastern day according to the time of a strange land-of-the-country city appearance, the theatre artistic tools group day and night work, carefully melting the scene building and the tools every detail, making the scene picture fine and historic.
Floods in two provinces in western Yemen kills 16 people
SANA News: According to local media on 26 July, severe rainfall in the western Yemeni province of Hodeida and Hajj has led to the deaths of at least 16 people in the last 48 hours.
The flood caused by the rainfall in Hodeida has killed 13 people, and three in the nearby Hage province have died in the flood.
In addition, dozens of houses in the northern and southern parts of Hokkaido have been destroyed by floods, and some roads and farms have been destroyed in different degrees.
Several years of military conflicts have led to a close collapse of the health system in Yemen.
According to the United Nations Humanitarian Affairs Coordination Bureau statistics, since 2017, the number of people infected with cholera in Yemen has exceeded 1 million, and the number of deaths has exceeded 2,000.
Yemen’s medical agencies are concerned that continued floods will lead to the re- spread of the cholera epidemic.

U.S. White House Advisors "anti-gathering" state rework too early
U.S. White House Advisors Reunits Early
On July 23, the number of cases diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia in the U.S. exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the world’s cases.
For months, U.S. President Trump has repeatedly asked the state to re-work, until the past few days he has changed his attitude, initially wearing the masks in public places, and his advisers are more "contra-touched" saying some state governments re-work too early.
On 22 May, White House president adviser Kelian Conway said in a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the restructuring standards and early reopened bars.
Conway also mentioned that previous claims about the president’s “absolute power” to decide the state’s reconstruction matters were false rumors.
“The president is a federalist, he believes that states have autonomy.
He justified Trump.
However, the “songs” in Conway, however, were expressed by Trump personally at the White House epidemic news conference on April 13.
This self-make-up operation has been fooled by the internet users as “rewrite history.”
Kylie Conway wants to rewrite history, she’s a trick.
Trump called Michigan Governor Grayne Whitmer a dictatorship because she followed medical standards and insisted on ceasing work.
Trump wants to push the rework so that he can hold a meeting.
It’s not the first time that Kelly Conway has brought up controversy.
On April 15, Conway said in an interview with Fox News, “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number and was crazy by the internet users: without a common sense, look at the newspaper!
Recently, we have seen the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data leakage of companies such as Morgan, Yahoo, Home and Tagit has led to hundreds of dollars, and even billions of dollars, losses.
With a number of attacks, the entire world economy will collapse.
The public sector cannot survive.
Between 2012 and 2014, the U.S. Department of Human Resources had a very serious data leakage.
Security licenses and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may have heard of some government-funded hackers trying to use the data stolen to influence the election results in some countries.
The two recent incidents, together, were the massive data theft of the Federal Parliament in Germany, and the U.S. Democratic National Committee’s e-mail theft.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic process.
And there is an increasing trend.
The more advanced the computer technology, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect data.
Especially a new computer technology, called quantum computers, which uses the microparticles of nature to significantly increase the computer’s operating capacity.
Its operating capacity is so powerful that it can break down many of the encryption systems we use today.
Do we have no hope?
Should we start repairing electronic survival equipment to meet the upcoming data end?
I don’t think that step is yet.
Quantum computers are still only in the laboratory, and it takes a few years from their actual use.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the crypto field.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of security communications.
Approximately 15 years ago I learned that we opened up new skills that were able to create a non-existent quantum effect in nature.
Using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology, this idea excites me.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including me, have advanced this technology to the phase of actual application.
right is.
We intend to use the quantum to fight the quantum.
How to realize?
First, we’re going to quickly understand the world of a bit of encryption.
You need a paper pack, and you have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond, to lock and ensure safety.
Because these materials are the highest secret, we have to use a super advanced paper package.
It is equipped with a special password lock, and once it is locked, it will convert the content of the file to random numbers.
So you just put the file in and lock it, and at this time the file has been converted to random numbers, and you have given this pack to James.
When the package has not yet been sent, you call him and tell him the password.
Once he got the package, enter the password, the file was completed, perfectly, you successfully passed a encrypted message to James Bond.
(Smile) A fun example, but it describes the three focus of encryption.
Password – we call it the encryption key.
You can imagine it as a password.
Tell us the James password.
We call it a secret key transmission.
This ensures that we can safely send the secret key to the specified place.
and locks used for encryption and decryption of files.
We call it an algorithm.
Through the secret key, it converts the content in the file into random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and without a secret key it is difficult to break down the password.
The importance of the algorithm is that if someone gets a package, open it, without a secret key, knowing the encryption algorithm, they cannot read the content in the document.
It’s just some random numbers.
Most security systems are dependent on the secure secret key transmission method, which transmits the secret key to the right place.
However, the rapidly growing computing capacity is in danger to many of the secret keys we currently use.
For example, we are now applying a very widespread system – RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 4 trillion years to break down a 426-bit RSA secret key.
In 1994, just 17 years later, this password was broken down.
As the performance of the computer is increasingly strong, the password we need is increasingly long.
Now we often use 2048 or 4096-bit passwords.
As you can see, the struggle between the encryptors and the decryptors is ongoing and they want to defeat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the arrival of quantum computers, will more quickly break down the complex mathematical algorithms, which are the basis of the encryption systems we use today.
In fact, the quantum computers will turn our security castle into a touch-down card house.
We are trying to protect our castle.
In recent years, many research institutions have appeared to study how the quantum effect is used to enhance encryption.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
High quality secret key, secure secret key transmission and strong algorithms.
However, the advancement of science and engineering, has been threatened by two of them.
The first thing to do is the secret key.
Random numbers are the basis of the secret key.
But today, they are no longer truly random.
Currently, we generate the secret key, which is based on random digital frequencies, generated by software, which we call false random numbers.
Programs or mathematical methods generate numbers, there will always be some, not so clear laws inside.
The lower the randomity of these numbers, or in terms of terms, the lower the contents, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked, and the way of attack is creative.
They photographed the line-up machine for a while and then analyzed it.
Cyber criminals use reverse engineering to produce fake random digital generators behind the switch.
Thus, they have a great chance of predicting the turnover and thus making a lot of money.
The key is not safe as well.
Having a real random digital generator is important to generate secure passwords.
For years, researchers have been trying to create a real random digital generator.
But most of the designs are either not random enough, or not fast enough, or hard to repeat.
But the world of the quantum is truly random.
The use of this real randomity is very important.
A device capable of measuring the quantum effect can very quickly generate continuous random digital flows.
The casino crime is no longer possible.
A number of universities and companies from all over the world are focused on making real random digital generator.
In my company, our quantum random digital generator was born on a 2m long 1m wide optical table.
Then we cut it to a box size.
To this day, you can already put it on a PCI card and put it on a ordinary computer.
This is the world’s fastest, truly random digital generator.
It can generate a billion random numbers per second by measuring the quantum effect.
Today, it has been widely used worldwide to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
However, even with a real random digital generator, we’re facing the second biggest cyber security threat: that’s the secret key’s security transfer problem.
The current secret key transfer technology is unable to cope with quantum computers.
And a quantum solution to this problem, called the quantum secret key distribution, shortly called QKD, it uses a base of quantum mechanics that violates the intuition characteristics.
Observing this behavior of the microscopic particles will change this particle.
I give an example to explain.
Let us think again, to give the password to James Bond.
But this time we didn’t call him, we used the quantum effect to carry this password with a laser bar and pass it to James through the ordinary optical fiber.
We assume Dr. Noah wants to get this password.
Fortunately, Dr. Noor will leave an electronic fingerprint in the process of trying to block this quantum secret key, which James and you can notice.
The secret keys that are blocked will be removed.
The remaining secret keys can provide strong data protection.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principles of physics, a quantum computer, or any future supercomputer, is impossible to break it.
I and my team are working with many top universities and the Department of Defense to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of safety products.
The Internet of Things predicts the arrival of a highly connected era, with 250-300 billion devices expected to have access to the Internet by 2020.
In order for our society to function properly in the IoT world, trust in these connected device systems is crucial.
We believe that quantum technology will be very important to build this trust and it will ensure that we fully enjoy these magical innovations and enjoy these innovations that can make our lives rich and colorful.
Thanks to everyone.

3 year old child school playground was struck, after receiving compensation again to the school party is right?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legislative Daily Author: Wanzhou Responsible Editor: Wanzhou
The playground was broken, the children received compensation.
□ This newspaper reporter Zhao Yuan
Three-year-old Chuan, when he was playing at a university playground, accidentally struck the head of Chen, who was arrested by the team, when he shot the ball.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Chen's father, Mr. Chen's legal agent, appealed the school to the court, asked for apology from the school in which the incident was placed, and paid medical fees, mental injury compensation, and a total of 20,000.
Recently, the People's Court of Beijing City, after the trial of the case, found that at the time of the incident the school established a protection network in the playground, has fulfilled the appropriate security guarantee obligations, and Chen has made compensation, according to this judgment rejected the applicant's appeal request.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer 2019 vacation, he was playing with Mr. Wen at the school playground, when he was training the team at the playground.
In order to avoid the risks arising from this, Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu and many other children and parents operate within the safe areas specified by the team.
But then the team member Chen Chen took his hands off when he shot the ball, leading the ball to fly over the guard net to the above safe zone and hit the small-scale back brain.
Mr. Wen immediately took Mr. Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head outward injury.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities in the school field do not comply with the relevant safety regulations, and that the team and the related facilities are not effectively managed.
The school’s fault caused the above events to occur, leading to the physical and mental suffering, and at the same time brought greater suffering to his family, the school must take legal responsibility for this.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has already set up a protective network in the playground, and published the management regulations, training notifications, informing the entrance to the playground must keep a safe distance with the training place and reminding attention to its safety, the applicant cannot prove the school "not fulfilled the security guarantee obligations", so it does not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court ruled that the area of the incident involves the university's free open area to the public, although the school has a security guarantee obligation to the management of the playground, this security guarantee obligation must only meet the general attention obligation.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective network in the playground, has fulfilled the appropriate security security obligations, and Chen also according to the previously reached compensation agreement compensated for medical fees, transport fees and other losses more than two thousand yuan, the two sides agreed to solve this dispute once.
After the incident, the parents again claimed school compensation, because the law was unfounded, the court ruled to reject the full appeal of the applicant.
After the judgment, both sides did not appeal, and the judgment has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of the Criminal Responsibility Act of China, the school as the administrator of public places, has a security guarantee obligation; in the event that the actions of a third party cause harm to others, the third party shall bear the infringement responsibility, and the administrator of public places who does not fulfill the security guarantee obligation shall bear the corresponding additional responsibility.
The judge said, as the administrator of public places, it is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place, to predict the risks and damages that may occur, so it is most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or to reduce the degree of damage, and to avoid and reduce the cost of the occurrence of losses to the minimum, so the law provides that it is responsible for the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, for non-specific entrance to the crowds in the playground open to the public, the security obligations undertaken by the school should be in accordance with the social activities it engages, in particular, primarily the basic security measures should be taken and the obligation to be informed of hidden hazards.
In judicial practice, it is not advisable to impose excessive security obligations to the administrators of public places.
If the school has already established a protection network and has fulfilled its obligation to inform it, it may be deemed that the school has no mistake and should not be held legal liable.
Furthermore, in the case of third-party infringement, even if the administrators of public places, such as schools, do not fulfill their security guarantee obligations, their responsibility is also as a supplement to damages, according to the latest published Civil Code, the administrator can also be refunded to third parties after taking additional responsibility.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should no longer extend the scope of request for compensation after receiving the direct infringement.
Today I want to show you how we make things in the future.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be able to self-assemble, self-repair and self-repair.
I will therefore show you what I think is the current state of the manufacturing industry, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have a roof building —— for two and a half years, 500,000 to more than a million parts, very complex, using new technologies in the fields of steel, concrete and glass.
We have an exciting machine that can take us into space—five years of time, two hundred and fifty thousand parts.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of proteins that can overlap in ten thousand nanoseconds, and we can copy DNA with three billion alkali-based pairs in about an hour.
This is the complexity of our natural systems, but they are very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complex than anything we can build.
They are more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves and maintain long life.
There is something super interesting about the natural system.
If we can transform it into our building environment, then the way we build things will have a great potential.
I think the key is self-configuration.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
First, we need to decode all the complexity of what we are going to build—that is our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into a simple sequence — basically the DNA of our building operating.
Then we need a programmable part that can accept this series and is used for overlaping or re-forming.
We need some energy to activate so that these parts of us can overlap according to the program.
We need some kinds of error correction to ensure that we successfully build what we want.
Therefore, I want to show you some of the projects I and my colleagues are underway to this self-assembly in the future.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale rebuildable robots—8 feet, 12 feet long protein.
They are embedded in mechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to cope, decode into a series of angles ——negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees,—this kind of thing; a series of angles, or turn, can be transmitted through this sequence by wires.
Each unit receives its own message — — for example negative-120. it rotates, checks whether it rotates to the place and then transmits the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers who work for this project.
I think this project really reveals: can it really expand?
I’m saying it spends thousands of dollars when many people make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? can we really embedded robots in every part?
The next question is to look at passivity, or to try passively to make reorganization programmatic.
But it was a step further, and it tried to make real calculations.
Basically embedded in the majority of computing infrastructure modules, digital logic doors, directly entering the various parts.
This is with non-door.
On each door to be used for calculation there is a quadruple, there are two entrance quadruple.
One of them is input from the user, just as you are building bricks.
The other is the entrance of a piece of brick before coming.
Then it will give output of three-dimensional space.
This means that users gather bricks in the way they want.
It is based on what you did before and your instructions.
Now it begins to move within the three-dimensional space — up or down.
Look at the left,[1,1] input is equal to 0 output, indicating to the bottom.
On the right side, the input of [0,0] is 1 output, indicating upward.
So that’s the real meaning that our structure now contains the blue map that we want to build.
Therefore, all the information about what you want to build has been embedded in it.
This means we have some form of self-replication.
In this case, I call it self-oriented copying, because your structure contains a precise blueprint.
If you have a mistake, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it and tells you how to repair it.
So you have one thing you can climb, you can read it and one one output.
It is directly embedded; no external instructions are entered.
I’m going to show the last project called the preferential chain, which may be the most exciting example of the passive self-installation system we see now.
It has reconstructability and programming that makes it for a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a series of elements.
Each element is completely the same, and they are preferential.
Each chain, or each element wants to turn to the right or to the left.
If you want to install a chain, you need to program for it.
To tell each unit whether to turn left or right.
When you swallow this chain, it is folded to program any structure that you coded for it — so in this case, a spiral, fire this case, two connected cubes.
Basically, you can program within a three-dimensional space—or one-dimensional, two-dimensional—that chain is completely passive.
What is the future that predicts us?
I think this tells us the possibility of this self-installation, self-replication and self-repair in our body structures, our structures and our machines.
There are new programming capabilities in these parts.
From there you can get new calculations.
We will have space calculations.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, and all the bricks can be calculated.
How amazing parallel computing and distributed computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think these projects I show you are just a small step towards the future, if we realize these new technologies for a new self-assembly world.
thank you.

Under the normalization of epidemic prevention, the enthusiasm of people to exercise is increasing.
With the gradual release of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also coming to recovery.
Fukushima has restored the trans-provincial tourism business since July 21, and the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, as a tourist popular destination, welcomed the peak of tourism.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists who arrive at Xiamen in the weekend.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers in the summer, while the airport’s passengers flow is mainly based on students, tourism and visitors.
The tourism market is gradually warming, and in July, Xiamen Airport operates an average of 440 times a day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% before the epidemic.
The airline has encrypted air speed lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities, capturing the recovery tourism market.
Currently, several travel agencies in Xiamen are on line with a set of summer domestic cross-provincial tour products, and team travel is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
With regard to the summit of summer passenger transport that appears on the train station and airport, the relevant units in the area of people easily gathered in the Value Machine cabin, the security check-in channels and other areas have been sent by people for the guidance, Fujitsu has also optimized the "8th Health Code", achieved health data sharing and mutual recognition between 31 provinces, and promotes a regular recovery of the tourism market.
Liu Dewa Liu Xiaoung can “destroy” new fireflower.
The Destroy Expert 2 announced recently that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film to be archived.
The second part remains Chou Shui, directed by Liu DeWare and directed by him, with a new story.
It is that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part, also makes the challenge that this breakdown expert faces more difficult, in the forecast several shocking screens, has been heart-shaking one line, the big explosion of the fungi cloud, the airport swept by fire, the scene is quite shocking.
Three years ago, the "Debolling Expert", produced by the original group of horses, won the fifth edition of the year's ticket room championship, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Gold Statue Award, and Chung Tian X Liu Dewa was also a gold medal partner in the audience's minds.
This time, the Destroy Expert 2 is also looking forward again to whether this pair of wing cards can throw out a new flame.
The Destroy Expert 2 tells a new story: the former Destroy Expert Pan (Liu DeWar) swallowed on the scene of the explosion and was listed by the police as suspects.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask for help from the good friend of the de-bombing expert, Chávez Chávez.
The woman who was urgent to break the case was inspected, and at the same time the former girlfriend of Pan (Nini) was also involved.
He is still a breakdown expert, but from the archive announcement he can feel the complexity of the new role of Liu DeWare: cut a leg, wearing his legs, on the one hand was traced by Liu Xiao Yun, who was a breakdown expert, and on the other hand was committed by his former girlfriend Nini.
What is the relationship between the three people, what Liu DeWare did in the Shenzhen hotel, what cases involved, what currents he has experienced in his career as a bombing expert, and what kind of mystery makes people curious.
It is understood that the film's main performances are the landscape of Hong Kong's world-marked buildings, along with the top special effects production team, bringing a shocking real visual shock.
(Journalists of New York)
The Russian Satellite Network reports that July 26 is the Day of the Russian Navy, celebrating the main marriage ceremony of the Day of the Navy held in St. Petersburg and Kalungstadt.
The Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, Vladimir Putin, arrived at Kalungstadt to participate in the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were inspected.
On July 28, 2019, the Russian Navy Day was celebrated in St. Petersburg.
Putin was to congratulate the Navy officers on the Day of the Navy, and on a boat on the Gulf of Finland passed from the boat that would take part in the marine march, and then checked the readers at the subjective table.
Putin said the Russian Navy fleet had the latest ships and special equipment, and the level of equipment continued to improve.
Putin said: “Russian Navy fleet has high-performance warships, strategic submarines and multifunctional submarines, aircraft and other aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment.
On June 24th, Russia celebrated the 75th anniversary of the victory of the War on the Red Square.
He also said the Russian Navy fleet will gain a unique advantage through digital and effective defence means.
The main maritime demonstrations to celebrate the Day of the Russian Navy were held in St. Petersburg and Kalungstadt, with a total of 46 ships participating, including the "General Casatonov" guard ship, the "General Kurakov" large anti-submarine, as well as large landing vessels, small missile vessels, guard vessels, submarines, etc.
Among them, a series of ships performed a static exhibition next to the Winter Palace Bridge of St. Petersburg, the most remarkable of which was the first Russian fighter ship "Portava" that was replicated in the early 18th century.
In order to avoid the spread of the new Crown virus, only local residents and special guests can enter Kalungstadt during the Navy's march this year.
The last Sunday of July is the Russian Navy Day.
Beijing Love Orchestra founder Yang Huang died at the age of 86.
On 26 July, the Beijing Ile Music Group issued a statement that the founder of the Beijing Ile Music Group, Chinese famous commander, music educator, lifelong academic member of the Central Music Academy, command department professor Yang Huang, died on July 26, 2020 at 13:55 p.m. in Beijing, aged 86.
Photo from the Beijing Love Orchestra's official website.
Yang Huang was born in 1934, Jiangsu Nanjing, who has loved music since childhood.
In 1951 he served as the Nanjing People's Broadcasting Broadcasting Group Commander, in the autumn of 1951 he was enrolled in the Shanghai Waddong Graduate Music Faculty, and he learned to command from Professor Yang Karin and German commander Hitzman, and to former Soviet expert Alzamanov to learn music and re-connection.
In 1958 he was taught at the music department of the Beijing Artist Fan Academy, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Central Music Academy composition department and command department.
Yang Huang founded Beijing Love Orchestra in 1983.
For more than thirty years, he has followed the aim of "love and dedication", led the band around the world, and has won dozens of great awards in important domestic and international competitions.
He has previously commandered the performances of more than 30 groups, including the Central Orchestra, the Central National Dance Group, the Eastern Dance Group, and the Shanghai Concert Group, and held several symphony concerts and singing concerts.
The books include “Band Training Science”, “Song Training Science”, “Two Songs Writing”, “Children’s Songs Collection” (up) and the paper “There is a Song Qualification Problem”, “There is a Orchestra’s Sound Level Planning”, as well as the translation of “Song Composer Law” and “Debussy’s and Sound Language”.
Do you know how many flowers there are?
There are 250,000 species—at least we know there are so many—in 250,000 flowering plants.
Flowers are a problem.
Growing plants is really difficult.
It requires a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is it so disturbing?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, gender.
I know what you think in your mind when you look at these pictures.
The reason for sexual reproduction is so important - plants have many other ways to reproduce.
It can be planted in the form of a branch; it can be multiplied in the same branch; it can be polluted in the same branch.
But they really need to spread their genes mixed with other genes so that they can make an ecological environment.
This is how evolution works.
Now the way the plants transmit this information is through the powder.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have a microscope that can see these scans.
How many types of flowers there are, how many different types of flowers there are.
This is quite useful for law medicine and so on.
The majority of it will cause us to suffer from pollen from those plants that spread pollen by the wind. This is a very inefficient process, and that’s why pollen always runs to our nose.
Because most of them are abandoned, hopefully the reproductive cells contained in the powder, male reproductive cells, will be able to fall accidentally on another flower.
All the grass, which means all the grains, and most of the trees spread by the wind.
But most species actually use insects to complete this process. to some extent this is smarter, because it does not require too much powder.
Insects and other species can carry flour powder and move flour powder directly to the place needed.
It is obvious that we notice the relationship between insects and plants.
This is a kind of symbiotic relationship, whether birds or bees, they can get a reward, and the reward they usually get is honey.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship can lead to a wonderful adaptation change – the red dress is a beautiful adaptation change.
The plants are also harvested, and they spread the powder to other places.
Plants have evolved, creating landing trails everywhere, and bees may be lost in them.
Some of the plants look like other insects.
These are flower poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry poultry.
In a certain degree, it really exists; it forces insects to climb over, put on the powder, and bring the powder to another place.
Flowers: There are at least twenty thousand kinds of flowers — many varieties are amazing.
They have a variety of flowers.
They need to try and attract powder transmitters to help them complete this process.
This flower, known as Darwin's flower, because it had been studied by Darwin and gave wonderful predictions when he saw this flower.
Basically, the insect had to do it—we came to the middle of the flowers—it puts the mouth in the middle of the way down to know the honey tube to get the honey.
Darwin said, looking at this flower, “I guess some things have evolved with it.”
It is undoubtedly insects.
When I mean, it is usually rounded, but after it stretches straight, it looks like that.
Now you can imagine if this so valuable thing is expensive for plants and can attract many polleners, then, as in human sexual behavior, people may begin to deceive each other.
They might say, “I have a bit of honey.Do you want to get a bit?”
This is a plant.
These plants are loved by the South African insects.They evolved into long mouths to get the bottom of honey.
It is an imitator.
This plant imitates a previous plant.
There’s a mouse with a long mouth that doesn’t get any honey from the false, because the false doesn’t give it any honey; it thought it could get it.
Therefore, not only the mice does not get honey from the fake plants, and -- if you look very close to the top of the head, you will see there some flour that flour will be spread to other plants, and if no botanist comes to stick it to a blue card.
These lies spread throughout the plant kingdom.
These flowers with black spots: They may seem like black spots to us, but I tell you, for the right species of male insects, it looks like two very sexy females.
When the insect arrives and lands on, put yourself in the powder, of course, these powder will be brought to other plants, and if you look at each family should have an electronic microscope scan image, you can see actually there some patterns, three-dimensional patterns.
It can even make the insects feel comfortable and look good.
These electronic microscope images—this is a flower that is concealed as an insect—you can see for our eyes, the different parts of the structure have different colors and different texture, and the insect may be able to perceive very different texture.
This flower has evolved to the extent that it can imitate the surface of a metallic glow that is seen on some shells.
Under the scan electronic microscope you can see this surface — which is very different from the other surface we’ve seen.
Sometimes the whole plant is imitated as an insect, even if we look like insects.
I mean, I think it looks like a kind of flying animal or beast.
It is a wonderful and magical thing.
This is its wisdom; it is known as the Black Friday Stone.
I think it is sometimes clever.
For the bees that are suitable for the species, it looks like another very aggressive bees, it will fly to hit it with its head many times, trying to throw it away, and of course, it will put it in the powder.
Another thing it does is that this plant imitates another kind of insect-rich food.
But actually nothing.
Therefore, it is cheating on two levels – it’s incredible.
(Smile) We see is Ilan, a part with a strong smell.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers do not really need to be so beautiful.
They spread a wonderful smell that attracts any interesting insects.
This flower smells nothing.
This flower actually smells very bad to mention again, it is evolving, it looks like roasted meat.
So the mice likes it.
The mosquitoes fly into and help them dust.
This is white star potato, also known as dead horse potato.
I don’t know what the dead horse smells, but the flower may smell very much.
It is really terrible.
The green mouse is not prohibited.
Fly into it, and the way into it.
On the top of the egg, it was thought that it was a bit of very good roasted meat, without realizing that there was no egg food here, these eggs would die here, but at the same time this plant would benefit, because the hard hair dissolved the mice disappeared, polluted to another flower — it was so wonderful.
This is the potato plants, European potatoes, Zee Ayoum, in this country is known as Long Age grass.
I took this photo last week in Dostoevsk.
This guy warms up about 15 degrees higher than the environmental temperature — incredible.
If you look at it inside, it’s a bit like a thunder, and the mice is attracted to the heat—this is a swallowing volatile chemical, and the insects—they are stuck under this container.
They drink sweet honey and then they become slightly confused.
In the night they are covered with powder, scratched over them, and then the hard hair we see above becomes exhausted, allowing these dirty powder insects to escape — it is incredible.
If you think it’s incredible, this is my favorite one.
This is Spring Flower.
Everyone who comes from Brazil should know this plant.
This is the most miraculous thing.
It’s a corner of about one foot long.
It has a capacity I know that no other plants possess, and when it flourishes—that is in the middle of the shell—for about two days, it produces some degree of metabolic change some similar to mammals.
It has no potato, it is the food of the plant, it has something very similar to brown fat at the speed of burning fat burning it, metabolizing it, about at the speed of a little cat.
According to the weight ratio, it is twice the energy output of the bird — absolutely surprising.
He also did something unusual.
It will not only be heated to 155 degrees Celsius, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius, for two days, but it will keep constant temperatures.
There is a temperature adjustment mechanism used to maintain constant temperature.
Why do you do this? I hear you ask.
You don’t know yet that some shell insects like to match at this temperature.
They go into, filled with powder.
The plants are filled with flour powder on them, let them leave and go to the powder.
How wonderful it is.
Now we think the majority of polleners are insects, but in fact in tropical areas, many birds and butterflies are also pollened.
Many tropical flowers are red, and this is because butterflies and birds are similar to us, we think they can be very good to see red.
But if you look at the spectrum, the birds and us, we see the red, green and blue to see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet rays, and they can see a variety of bright ultraviolet rays.
There are some colors behind it.
“Is it not good if we can see those colors,” I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
What do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert linen, half-day flowers, in Dostoevskaya.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, all over the world are these little yellow flowers.
In visible light it looks like that.
If you remove the red it looks like that.
Most bees do not perceive the red.
Then I put an ultraviolet filter in front of my lens at a specific frequency of ultraviolet exposure for a long time, I got this photo.
It’s like a real wonderful target.
Now we don’t know what the bees really see, and when I call it red, you know what I’m looking at.
We can’t know what’s happening in it, whether it’s insects or other human brain.
But the comparison seems probably that way. out of the background.
This is another small flower -- located in different UV frequency intervals, different filters to match different powder transmitters.
It seems probably that way.
To avoid you thinking that all the yellow flowers have this attribute -- no damage to the flower during the filming process; just put it on the three-foot plate, not removed -- under UV light, look at this.
This can serve as the basis of a sun cream, as the sun cream works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Therefore, chemicals may have some benefits.
Finally, it’s a nightworm that was sent to me by the Norwegian Björn Rorslett — a wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this hidden way.
These photos were taken with ultraviolet filters, and the main use of these filters was used by astronomers to photograph the Venus — actually the cloud layer on the Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, this is the story of flowers.
As the flowers spend so much energy trying to attract the polleners to receive their invitation, no matter why, they also succeeded in making us believe that it contains rich content We send each other flowers when we are born and dying, especially when the wedding, when you think of it, just in this moment the genetic material from the Migration of one organic to another.
very thankful.

The Chongqing City Development and Reform Committee (Chongqing City Development and Reform Committee) announced on July 26 that the city has so far withdrawn 4404 fishermen, representing 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
This year, the 53-year-old Lee said in an interview with the Chinese news agency, that his grandparents were fishing on the river of Long River, he was 11 years old following his father fishing, swallowing a small boat, walking along the river of Long River, climbing to Chongqing, down to long life, every time leaving the house is ten days and a half month, by fishing to maintain the family life.
But since 1997, as the rural population has gradually flown to the town, the population in the town is increasing and the environmental pollution is increasingly severe.
Long along the river, paper factory, chemical factory, farms were built, and the river water was also polluted.
By 2007 and 2008, the river was transformed into a dirty water burst.
The fish that is caught is black, and the fish that is caught is black.
The state said that fishing is increasingly difficult after river water pollution.
The local authorities began to take a lot of effort to manage the river pollution, including shipping, tour, water resource management, and so on.
Lee also transferred production from fishermen, becoming a member of the cruise team, managing the water resource.
From January 1, 2020, the Chongqing City Aquatic Biological Protected Area and the main city area related waters have been enforced.
According to the Chongqing City Development Reform Committee data, so far, Chongqing City has accumulated 3403 fishing vessels, 4643 fishing vessels have signed a fishing agreement, representing 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year mission, respectively.
4404 fishermen have been evacuated, representing 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4404 people who have been retired, 4267 people achieved employment, representing 96.89% of those who have been retired.
The pension insurance covered 2691 people, accounting for 61.10% of retirement fishermen.
The next step, Chongqing City will deepen the various special repair operations, accelerate the advancement of the Longjiang dry flow coastline use project cleaning repair, complete a new round of Longjiang in the river emissions counting and carry out the corresponding repair operations, fundamentally complete the "three phosphorus" repair task, small hydroelectric cleaning repair work, promote the Longjiang both coastline forest greening special operations, strengthen the green mining construction, consolidate the Longjiang dry flow illegal terminal, illegal mining special repair results, deepen the advancement of the Longjiang river prohibition repair work.
Israel Strengthens Control Against Repeated Epidemic
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Lightning Daily Author: Wang Yong Responsible Editor: Wang Yong
Israel to strengthen control over repeated epidemics
In the early stages of the epidemic of New Crohn, Israeli preventive measures were clearly successful.
However, with the gradual dismantling of the preventive measures, the number of new coronavirus diagnosed in Israel has increased significantly in recent years, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention of the epidemic.
On February 28, the Israeli territory confirmed the first case of new coronavirus, to quickly take closure of all entrance ports, suspend unnecessary industries, school changes to online teaching, restrict public transport and unnecessary social activities, block the epidemic serious cities, military police joint maintenance and control measures, and so on.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by the middle of May, Israeli single-day new coronary pneumonia confirmed cases fell once again to one point.
As the epidemic has been controlled, Israeli preventive measures have been completely dismantled, and since June, the number of new diagnoses of coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after the entrance of July, the spread rate of the epidemic has been increasingly accelerated.
In recent days, more than 1,500 new cases were added daily in Israel for eight days, and 916 new cases were added on July 25 when it was published.
As of July 25, there have been 59745 cases diagnosed in Israel, with a total of 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention of the epidemic.
On July 6, the Israeli government closed public entertainment sites, including gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, which provides that the passengers of each bus should not exceed 20 people.
On 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the “Closed City” in the weekend, and the implementation of the “Closed City” between Friday 17th and Sunday 5th.
During this period, people will be able to go out, but shops, shopping centers, hairstyles, beauty halls, libraries, zoo, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, and basic service sites, such as supermarkets, pharmacies, will remain open.
At the same time, in all dates and times, more than 10 people will be prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be prohibited, and only the outsourcing service is allowed.
At the same time, the people of Israel did not pay sufficient attention to the severity of the epidemic and did not work together with the government in the fight against the epidemic.
After the repeated epidemic in Israel, many people protested on the streets because government controls affected their economic interests.
On July 11, thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv that anti-epileptic policies affected the economy.
On Wednesday night, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, protests against Prime Minister Netanyahu’s prohibition of restaurants, coffee shops and non-compensation measures.
In addition, many people in outdoor activities also do not comply with the rules of wearing a mask, keeping two meters safe social distance, to avoid police fines for not wearing a mask, many people only wear a mask on their underwear or hang on their arms.
During the repeated epidemic, the school was a serious catastrophic area of the new coronavirus spread, and according to the journalists recently visited this kindergarten found that both the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear a mask according to the government's request, norined one another two meters safe social distance, for a large number of students infected with the virus to be damaged.
Professor Eli Waksman, a member of the counseling group of epidemiologists at the Israeli National Security Council, said Israel is moving towards a “dangerous situation” and said Israel’s current measures to prevent the epidemic are not sufficient, and all recreational, entertainment and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waksman said Israel had a lack of a general plan against the epidemic, and the parliamentary and government departments should remove their interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the issue of the epidemic, and make clear steps to measure restrictions related to the various departments.

The former farmer of Ningxia, Wu Feng Feng, was unable to bring his spouse to the heavens, two people were sitting in a car, from 20 miles away from the house, to the Liu Yun Cultural Hall.
Despite the two years of uncomfortable legs, the 77-year-old Dae Tiffo is still expecting "three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three."
This is an untouchable garden in the original state district of Fukushima, unlike the general farmhouse, in the garden often appears the long-lasting Qin Hull, and also wonderful paintings, paintings, traditional Qin Hull, Qin Hull, and so on.
The owner of the house was named Liu, who was a woodman.
More than a decade ago, loving painting and singing, he began planning to build a cultural hall.
With the Liu Cloud Cultural Hall, the cultural life of the villagers became rich and colorful.
The journalist has not yet entered the Liu Yuan Cultural Hall, and Qin Yuan's sound has already passed out.
The chanting of Qin Huang for the villagers is the neighboring village village resident Berishan.
She has loved Qin Huang since her childhood, now in the local area has been small and famous, as long as there is a free time, she will come to the Cultural Hall for the countryside to show programs.
Recently, Berry Chan also played online live broadcasts.
Berishan said, “A scene to make more people see their performance is a very happy thing.”
On the stage, the singer looks one hand, the player looks one hand, despite being a amateur fan, but the enthusiasm is not reduced at all.
Like the simple style of the farmhouse, outside of Qin Huang, the "green roots" art and non-historic culture in the Liu Huang Cultural Hall appear.
The Hall also collected more than 300 materials from different ages of agricultural equipment, traditional and handmade wheat, cutting paper, scratch, and paint.
Liu brought the journalist to the showroom in the hall, in which he showed the old objects of his collection, the old wine cup, the triangle, the textile car and so on.
Why does a regular farmer build a cultural hall?
“The painting is my home craftsmanship, and I started learning this craftsmanship from the age of 15.”
The Liu Yun Cultural Hall was founded in 2012 and became the first rural “non-material cultural heritage exhibition hall” in Ningxia, as well as the demonstration hall for the protection of non-material cultural heritage.
In addition to the Liu Yuan Cultural Hall, there were also more than 120 cultural halls, 79 public show groups, of which, there are more than 50 cultural halls of a certain scale, such as the Liu Yuan Cultural Hall, the Liu Yuan Cultural Hall, the Liu Yuan Cultural Hall, etc., covering the various villages and streets of the Liu Yuan, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grain artists are active in the field land, enriching the cultural life of the crowds and satisfying their spiritual needs.
As life becomes better, the traditional culture cannot be dropped.
“Lyuan Spy Warfare” again returns to “Winning” to see Liu Yunong Li Li Group opponent “Shooting” – New China Network
The 40 Spy War Theatre "Win count" will land on Beijing Guard on July 16.
Based on the real history, the "Victory" is made up of the Soviet military archives that have been covered by dust for many years and for the first time.
Actor Liu Yunong, known to the audience for the "spy war drama", broke the image in the drama, challenging a pleasant "make-up agent".
In the last few years, the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes of the scenes.
Unlike previous spyware works, the "Victory" looks at the world, extending the story from the background to the Soviet Far East Battlefield.
On the background of the last phase of the 1944 anti-Japan war, it tells the story of the CPC secret intelligence officer Don Fei, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Subterranean Party of China and the Director of the Soviet Remote East Intelligence Bureau, conducting the Soviet Remote East Intelligence Bureau's "Mudan Ula" strategic operation.
In many spy wars, the male protagonist as a senior spy, one appearance is a beautiful, high intelligence, mature perfect image.
But in Liu Yunong appears, such a person is not suitable for being a spy, "the spy should be that kind of person who can't find in the crowd of people, if one appears is that kind of very cute image, don't want everyone to pay attention to you, can you still hide? "You don't come to catch me, I'm all forgotten that I'm a national party," the spy will go to the elite.
So in the Victory, Liu Yunong don’t be afraid to design his protagonist, Chongqing, as a pleasant “make-up agent.”
The other side of the camp in Victory, was supported by the Japanese Fujin and Li Li Group playing the police hall of Long Fujin.
One south and one north, the two power parties, added a lot of excellence points to the whole drama.
The director used the word "shaking" to describe the drama of Lee Li Group and Liu Yunong's opponent play, "it's absolutely shaking, they're two special consensus, they're in this consensus very shocking to me to say. many times their play is 'touched', for example we just wrote half page of paper length, when shooting I don't scream, they can always play to shake.
When the actors are in the role and guarantee their character status, they can not only form the role from the character perspective, but can also bring to the audience more possibilities of viewing, and they say that such a play is good enough.
In the drama, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Lyuan Spy Warfare" series, the "Wind Cube" in the name of the earthquake one time, the "Mountain City F4" of the "Wind Cube" and the "Wind Cube" also gathered three places.
He played Song Huan and Zhao Jin's Huan and Liu Nam Yan, this time again playing Don Fly's left-hand right arm.
The director said, "These two people have no poor rootness, they just flowed with the wave in that time, in that environment."
Liu Yunong also initiated, "We want someone feel. this person feel is that people around me must have good and bad, the bad people are enemies, but also to develop them, our team must also grow up and grow up."
The way to the end of the two in the drama is also well designed by Liu Yunong, he believes he will deliver a satisfactory answer to the audience.

Hong Kong Special District Government Financial Affairs and Treasury Bureau Director Liu Xiao Yu said Hong Kong’s financial markets remain active and operate properly.
He is optimistic about Hong Kong’s financial stability and economy.
In a online seminar held in Hong Kong’s Economic Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong Trade Council (Canada General Assembly) on 24 (Toronto Time), Liu Xiao said that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation due to the “reform wave” and the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The exchange rate is stable and preferred to a strong exchange guarantee level.
The banking system has no clear signs of money flows, on the contrary, more than $11 billion has flows since June.
The bank’s total deposits have continued to increase in the past few months, with a series of open-source funding activities on the stock market, and market transactions have increased frequently.
Liu Xiao said the new coronavirus epidemic brings pressure on the global economic and financial markets, but Hong Kong’s basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communications, free circulation of information and funds, and a simple low tax system, making Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Liu Xiao noted that the government of the special district reserves 6 billion HRK in the “Anti-Epidemic Fund”, creating about 30,000 time-limited positions in public and private sectors in the next two years, covering different skills and academic qualifications.

He encourages Canadian companies to take advantage of Hong Kong’s advantages and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center, and a global offshore yuan business center, to develop and invest in the Guangzhou Bay and nearby regions.
Liu Yei's newspaper praises China's anti-epidemian efforts to encourage countries to learn experience - China New Network
As a country with 1.4 billion inhabitants, a size similar to Europe or the United States, the phase of the New Crown epidemic is effectively controlled, without any more large-scale disclosure, China has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
Over the past decade, China has invested significantly in domestic research and public health building, making China much more prepared for the new crown than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that year.
The author said that when SARS exploded in 2002, China was unprepared at the beginning, especially the pathogens were uncoverable.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus type, and on January 11, 2020 they shared with the international genome sequence data.
By the end of January, doctors from the mainland of China and Hong Kong explained the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through a research paper published on The Liu Liu.
China has also been in the forefront of vaccination research, in the state declaring a state of emergency, through domestic close cooperation, such research was launched very quickly and strictly in May and July, respectively on the "Liu Yei" announced the results of advances in the early test of the new crown vaccine developed in China.
China’s experience shows that investing in the national health and research system and effectively improving laboratory capabilities is of great importance.
This is the basis for the country’s quick and effective response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are very worth learning and learning.
Furthermore, China’s experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, it is necessary to have a strong high level to make the right decisions on a scientific basis and to make the New Crown epidemic effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the value of science and act against it in the most beneficial way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the National Health and Development Committee of China sent three groups of infectious diseases experts to Wuhan to investigate the risks and spread of the New Crown virus, their recommendations provide the basis for the decision of Wuhan on January 23 “Closing City”; when experts suggested the need and urgency of building a square hospital, the government quickly made the decision and rapidly implemented; at the same time, the broad participation of the community and the crowd, also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
The article ultimately emphasizes the need for countries to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond to global health emergencies.

Battleground standing point, ranging long remains and a warrior operating station.
In the places where the average year temperature is below zero a dozen degrees, a line of simple camps stands on the mountains, the camps are not far from one side of the national flags floating, the soldiers work every day in the wind, while regularly traveling to higher places of sea patrol.
The warriors climbed up the rocks of rocks and needed hands and feet.
At the end of July, it was the time when the low-height areas of the flower flourished, and in Bahá’u’lláh, only in the mountains behind the campsite there was a relatively intense green.
The warrior Gonging, who has been on the spot for six years, pointed to the mountains and said that this is their back garden, every year only on the 7th of August can see the green grass slowly grow out, shortly afterwards, all becomes yellow, covered by snow.
Walking patrol may take about nine hours.
Under the bad altitude conditions, the warriors who reside here accompany snow mountains and glaciers all year, and they are also going regularly to the higher mountains of the sea.
On the other day, a patrol team consisting of eight fighters, under the leadership of the guide Liu Liu, went on the patrol path again.
Each soldier weighs about 30 kilograms and goes to the target point in the morning.
In the way, a warrior was rebellious, and the warriors were emergency aid.
In addition to the patrol missions, the fighters in the Bahá’u’lláh Point are required to perform tactical and physical training every day.
The time passed a minute and a second, the height continued to rise, the oxygen content was increasingly low, the physical strength continued to be exhausted, these factors tested the will of the patrollers.
They tightened their teeth, passing through a number of crashes, and passing through a number of struggling beaches.
At 16 a.m., it was the time of lunch for the patrols, they took out their own dry food, sitting on the ground at more than 5,700 meters of sea height, accompanied by the rainfall of snow, and supplementing their physical strength with food.
The warriors at the Bahá’u’lláh Point performed tactical and physical training.
During the rest, they will play cards together, the loser will be able to take down, both entertain and can exercise physical energy.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of this patrol, drawing the national flag on the mountains and solemnly swearing.
Behind them are the Snow Mountains, the front of them is a few thousand kilometers of unmanned area, and they are the safest guardians of the national gate.
Beijing consumption season reopened - New China Network
According to the principle of "comprehensive restart, focal planning, organized advancement and rigorous organization", the city of Beijing has restarted the activities of the Beijing consumption season.
On July 26, 1.5 million political enterprises consumer tickets were issued, including one million online food and food shopping tickets, 500,000 smart product tickets, and consumers can receive the app in Kyoto.
Vice-Director of the Beijing City Trade Bureau, Liu Maying, presented at the media conference held on 25th, that the consumption season after re-establishment, on the basis of the strength of the existing consumption card bonus subsidy, further reduces the corporate distribution.
Starting from the beginning of August, the government and enterprises invested the current 1 and 1 dividend to 2 and 1, such as the original consumer receives a pack to the store after consumption if they can enjoy 120 yuan discount, of which the government subsidies 60 yuan, the enterprise subsidies 60 yuan; the government subsidies 80 yuan, the enterprise subsidies 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, three major operators will support traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing’s 5G new building and 5G new consumption.
Chen Moobo says Hong Kong's economy has been hit again due to the epidemic and calls for a difficult time for all sectors.
Chen Moubo, Director of the Department of Finance of the Government of Hong Kong Special District, said on 26 July that Hong Kong is facing a new wave of coronary pneumonia epidemic shock, originally little seen the recovery of trade transactions and economic activities are also affected.
The Government of the Special District once again calls on large and small owners to reduce the lease and to deal with retailers, food and small and medium-sized enterprises.
On the same day, Chen Moubo published an article on the internet entitled "The Way of the Resurrection of the Sassy".
He said Hong Kong's recent diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia has a high number of cases, the situation is severe, it has affected the social life of the people, and it also troubles the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the priority is to strictly prevent the intrusion of cases and to treat and interrupt the viral transmission chain at the fastest time; when the epidemic is controlled, economic activity should be restored at the appropriate time.
He pointed out that in the face of a new wave of epidemic shock, the trade and economic activity that had been a little recovery was also affected.
For the business community, social responsibility is equally important in addition to the spirit of contracts, especially those who receive a large amount of government subsidies in the “Employment Insurance Plan”.
He pointed out that Hong Kong’s economic situation in the second quarter of this year remains very severe, but the recession appears to be slightly slow.
In terms of exports, he believes the situation in Hong Kong remains severe.
Chen Moobo said Hong Kong’s development history in the past decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I was driving to work, I found the city covered by a bull.
I was driving around there almost every day, but this time it was unusual, and I’ve never seen such a scene before.
Johannesburg is famous for its unparalleled Beautiful Skyline, but it was hardly seen that morning.
Soon I realized that what I saw was the severe bull caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment that I knew in the old days and the sky lines covered by the darkness of this moment, flows in my heart.
I am worried that it is very likely that the beautiful sunrise that has ever changed color will be eaten by the dark shadows.
At that moment, I felt a strong impulse, wanting to do something, but I didn’t know what to do.
What I know is that I can’t look like this.
The biggest challenge is that I don’t understand environmental science. air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I’m a computer engineer and I’m very sure I’m not using encoding to solve the air pollution problem.
How will I solve this problem?
I am just a small townman.
In the next few years, I’ve learned a very important lesson, and if we want to a better future, we should all remember that lesson.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may also contain ways to solve the problem in that field.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you have can stimulate an irregular thought and thus direct the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
Only in this way you can know the outcome.
What I knew at that time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to have enough knowledge of pollution first, so I made a student back.
I’ve done some basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world’s largest environmental health risk.
Data from the World Health Organization shows In 2012, 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution in households and surroundings, which is common in low-income countries.
Air pollution causes a higher rate of death per year than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, unsafe health conditions caused by premature deaths, or deaths caused by poor nutrition of children, appear blurred in front of air pollution, while it also brings huge economic costs: According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development statistics, the 2013 related expenditure exceeded $400 billion.
In my work, I explore the advanced technological achievements of artificial intelligence, including human-machine relationships, finding a useful foundation and helping us make better decisions.
When I think again about the air pollution issue, about how to manage the air pollution issue, things become clear, we need to find better ways to make better decisions considering the problem is huge, cooperation is very necessary.
So I decided to get to know some people who work in this field.
I started a dialogue with officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, I also joined the local scientific community, and I also called a few calls to completely strange but related people.
These experiences I started to interfere helped me to understand this issue more deeply.
It also helped me to avoid my line of people trying to innovate Sometimes they fall into the hole: rapidly applying a technology before they really have the problem.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I began to ask myself how to effectively combine my knowledge skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the professional skills of the people I’ve contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform, to reveal future pollution trends, to make relevant forecasts to judge possible results.
I am convinced that my thought can be a solution to reality, but also faced with uncertainty, and I cannot guarantee that it will succeed.
What I have is a set of specific engineer skills, the skills gained from my work. (laughter) Of course, for those who have been working in the field of air pollution for years, my skills are completely new.
I gradually realized that sometimes a new perspective, a new combination of skills, can trigger some excellence.
Our will and imagination is a guide light that guides us to overcome obstacles and open a new chapter.
I gained a deeper understanding of the air pollution issue, finding air pollution data over the past decades, as well as weather data in Johannesburg and its surroundings.After that, I and my colleagues in South Africa and China created a air quality resolution support system and uploaded it to the cloud.
The software can analyze history and real-time data to reveal the trends of pollution changing over time and space.
We then use the new machine learning technology to predict future pollution a few days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily travel and where their families settle.
We can predict adverse pollution events in advance, identify the severity of the source of pollution, so that the relevant authorities can submit instructions to adjust their business activities.
By assisting scenic planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as residential settlements in industrial areas.
We have built a advanced pilot of the technology, running 120 days, covering all South Africa.
Our forecast results have been verified.The forecast data we show and the data we collect on the site show close relevance.
Through our management, we introduced the world’s leading advanced instruments to predict the atmosphere quality, its resolution and accuracy are unprecedented, so that the recent winter morning in which I entered the city could benefit.
So, the focus is: What if I didn’t study the issue of air pollution?
What if I don’t focus on the environmental situation of the country, but send hope to some places, to some others to take care of these things?
I learned from the middle that when we do our best to advance a career we all believe in, focusing on the possibility of success and considering the consequences of failure is important.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should motivate us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find some kind of curiosity you are born is excitated, and it’s also about what you’re interested in, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it’s not your field of profession, ask yourself: Why not try it?
Why don’t you dare to come straight to solve the problem? do your best in your own way?
You may get an unexpected joy.
Thanks to everyone.

The biggest earthquake in Taiwan's eastern waters occurred this year.
China News Agency Taipei 26 July Telegraph Taiwan Eastern Oceans 26th at 20:52 a.m. occurred a 6.1 degree earthquake in the size of Ritchie, the largest earthquake in the size of 4 degrees, the entire Taipei has a tremendous sensation, is the largest earthquake in the size of the entire Taipei this year.
The Taiwan Meteorological Department that the earthquake was located 86.5 km south-east of the Iilan County government, i.e. the eastern ocean of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 km.
The earthquake is estimated to be 5.5 degrees.
The greatest earthquake in all parts of Taiwan is: Qingdao County 4 level, IKEA County, Taiwan County, South Pong County, Yunnan County 3 level, and other county cities measure 1 to 2 level of earthquake.
The Taiwan Meteorological Department pointed out that this earthquake is the largest earthquake in the region since this year, which belongs to the border of the plate, and its earthquake has often occurred in the past, and has been more active since this year.
The remaining earthquake of more than 4 degrees will continue to occur in the next week.
Many people think driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Blind people want to drive a car separately and safely until now, it is also considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, We built a car designed for people with visual disabilities for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I talk about this blind car, let me briefly describe another project I’ve ever done called the U.S. Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Program’s City Challenge.
It is about making a mechanical car that can drive by itself.
You press the Start key and no longer touch anything, and it can also fully automatically reach its destination.
In the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 to get the third place in the match.
Approximately at that time, the National Blind Association, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that could make the Blind self-driving safe.
We think we’re going to try it, because we think it’s going to be hard to go.
We already have an automatic car.
We just let the blind drive inside, that’s not going to be done, right?
(Smile) But we are not wrong.
What the blind group wants is not a car that can carry blind people, but a car that can initially make choices and drive.
So we have to give up all our original things from the beginning.
To test this mad idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand car to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited a lot of blind young people across the country and gave them the next chance to ride with this car.
This is definitely a cool experience.
But the problem is that it’s designed only to allow blind people to drive in a very limited environment, like a closed parking area – and can even drive on the small roads made with red trailers.
So with this success, we decided to take the important next step, making a real car that could drive on the real road.
So how does it work?
Well, this is a relatively complex system, but let me explain it, to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have sensory stages, calculation stages and non-visual interfaces.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to perceive the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
For this, we use the initial measurement component.
It measures the acceleration, the corner acceleration—as the human ear, the inner ear.
I combine this information with the global positioning system to predict the location of the vehicle.
We also use two cameras to detect the route.
We also use three laser distances.
Laser scanning environments to detect obstacles—from the front and behind passing vehicles while also entering any obstacles on the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the massive amounts of information then aggregate into the computer, and the computer will do two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment—what are the routes and what are the obstacles—and to convert this information to the driver.
The system is also very intelligent and can calculate the safest route.
We can also issue instructions on how the vehicle operates.
But the question is: how can we transmit information and instructions quickly and accurately enough to the blind person to make sure he can drive?
For this purpose, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional sound system, trembling backbone, sound control wheels, leg bands, and even foot pressure shoes.
But today we are talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called Driving Handle.
This is a pair of gloves, in the indication section it has a tremendous component, so you can transmit the instructions how to drive – direction and width.
Another device is called the speed band.
This chair – in fact, it is a massage chair.
We break it out, we reorganize the vibrant components of different patterns. We allow them to transmit the speed of information, while also instructions on how to use fuel doors and brakes.
Here you can see how the computer understands the surrounding environment. Because you can’t see the trembling, we actually installed a red lighting diode on the driver so he can see what’s going on.
This is the data of the sensor, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So both of these devices, driving bracelets and speed bands, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are instructions indicating the device.
That’s not true freedom, right?
The computer tells you how to drive – turn to the left, turn to the right, accelerate, brake.
I call this a subsidiary problem.
So we are avoiding instructions indicating the device, and more focusing on the information device.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty map.
See this as a blind monitor.
This is a small desk with a lot of holes on top, the compressed air is removed from it, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you are blind and you put your hand on it, you can feel the pathways and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency released in the air There is a possibility that there is a temperature.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here you can see the camera on the left and right both sides as well as how the computer analyzes and transmits this information to the empty map.
This is how we are showing a simulation program that a blind man is driving with an empty map.
This program is very helpful in training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different types of non-visual user interfaces.
This is basically how it works.
But this car is a model car and it will not be on the road unless it is proven to drive as safe as today’s car, or more secure.
I really believe that will happen.
But, can society, they accept this radical idea?
How will we deal with insurance?
How will we issue a driving license?
Behind the technical challenges there are many different obstacles we need to solve before they really become reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a blind driving car.
But the potential more important is the enormous value contained in this project’s side-products.
Sensors can be used to view the dark, rain bull.
As well as this new type of interface, we can use these technologies to make them more secure vehicles for the visible crowd.
Or for the blind, the daily life of household devices - educational facilities, office facilities applied services.
Imagine, in the classroom, the teacher writes notes on the black board The blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher writes.
This is extremely valuable.
What I show you today is just a beginning.
very thankful.

Marinichev said the change in value was influenced by ruble devaluation and epidemic.
He said, “The cost of service is increasing.
Because of the epidemic, people begin to spend more time on the internet.
Marinichev does not exclude the annual internet prices will rise drastically, believing that operators can provide customers with higher rates and more services to compensate people's dissatisfaction with the price rise.
“China Doctors” to celebrate an anti-epileptic hero – New China Network
In recent days, with the honour of Chinese filmmakers against the epidemic hero, the Board of Directors of the Bona Film Group in the winter, the director Liu Wei-jong (image left) in Guangzhou and Chung-nan-san academics, discussed the production of the anti-epidemic film "China Doctor".
Bona Cinema hopes to be able to thanks to "China Doctors", to all the healthcare and anti-epidemian workers fighting on the front line of epidemic control!
In 2021, the film will be released in the country as a film dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, Bona Cinema is being deployed under the arrangement of the Ministry of China and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Province Film Bureau and the Hokkaido Province Film Bureau, organizing the film "China Captain" former group of people to shoot the film "China Doctor", which is a film that reflects under the strong leadership of the Central Party, the nation's people unite together against the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on the Wuhan Anti-Epidemic Line, will feature the character background of the Wuhan medical staff and the O'Hare medical team of the provinces, from a human perspective, using unique narratives, as well as a very shocking lens language, and all-screen shows the sensitive story of the anti-Epidemic Line full of dedication and sacrifice of Chinese medical staff.
It is known that in the first time of the day of Wuhan dismantling, Bona company then overcome heavy difficulties, sent the shooting group deep into the epidemic line, with hundreds of healthcare workers face-to-face communicate knowledge, collect information, has currently interviewed including Chongnan Mountain academic himself, Guangzhou Tsing Wuhan first person, Guangzhou Tsing O Medical Team, as well as Wuhan Qing Zheng Hospital, Wuhan Association Hospital, Wuhan University Central South Hospital, Wuhan Center Hospital and other anti-epidemic front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front front.
The Chongnan Mountain Academic also expressed expectations and hopes for the filming: "I am looking forward to you not only to visit some more experts, but also to interview more medical professionals who are hard-working on the first line, they are the majority.
He said he had previously seen "I and My Motherland" and "China's Captain" and believed that the way of telling big-screen stories from the ordinary people's perspective is good.
Now some foreign friends have some misunderstandings about China.
Speaking about the spread of the film, Chongnan Shan academic said that some people currently abroad like to put the virus on political labels, he hopes that the film can attract the audience from a human perspective: "This film, in addition to China's display, is best to be shown abroad, to use the way that the audience can understand, with the real human spirit to attract the audience.
Chongnan Shan academic also deeply remembered the 1980s film "Man to the Middle Ages", "There's been so many years, I'm most impressed with the film after the reform and the opening of the film or "Man to the Middle Ages", when the doctors friends outside of our country were watching crying, if "China Doctor" could play such a role, then it's great.
Chongnan Shan said that if "China Doctor" could trigger the resonance of foreign audiences, it would be very successful.
During the conversation, Chongnan Shan Academy also shared opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention, "I believe people are always smarter than viruses."
Though the virus is difficult to predict, but from the primitive society to the present day, mankind has gone through a lot of difficulties, today the modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, plus the medical staff around the world, and even the people have a basic understanding of the science of responding to the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before, "there is to pay attention to the two aspects of the work, one is to study how the whole world to strengthen cooperation, the second is to focus on the comfort of people."

Japan's new crown diagnosis has more than 30,000 cases - New China Network
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases were added in Tokyo on 26th, more than 200 new cases were added on a single day for six days in a row, a total of 1121 cases.
In addition, Osaka County has added 141 new confirmed cases, Fukuoka County has added 90 new cases, and Eid County has added 80 new cases.
The first half of the telecommunications network fraud crime increased by 70 percent the highest inspection summary characteristics.
According to the website of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, in the first half of this year, the national prosecutor’s body has accused 58101 people of fraud crime, compared to an increase of 35%.
Specifically in preventing epidemic prevention crimes, fraud crimes are more common, and the prosecutor’s body accounts for 43.4% of the total number of preventing epidemic prevention crimes.
The Supreme People's Prosecutor's Office has targeted guidance, and of the ten typical cases of epidemic prevention that are currently published, nine of them involve fraud.
From the first half of the year, the prosecutor’s procedure, the names of fraud crimes are numerous, up to the country’s macro policy, down to the people’s food housing, including epidemic fraud, “medicine” fraud, “health goods” fraud, “recruitment intermediary” fraud, “route loan” fraud, fraud to state subsidy fraud, national assets decomposing fraud, etc., continuously “draw out new”, the scope involves education, healthcare, employment, retirement, social security, land displacement, accurate reduction of poverty, financial credit and other areas, not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affects economic and social development.
Specifically, some telecommunications network fraud breaks the boundaries of national, geographical and personnel, has characteristics of public, cross-border, remote, electronic payments and other non-specific groups of victims, and great danger.
For example, some establish specialized companies, rent high-quality writing buildings, establish multiple departments or positions, use the legitimate web platform for advertising, recruitment, training and evaluation of recruiters, use business operating model management, wear "legal clothes", confusion stronger.
The punishment and prevention of crimes according to the law, and timely issuing pre-warning to the public and the relevant departments, is the responsibility of the prosecutor’s body.
In judicial proceedings, the prosecutor’s body seriously performs its duties, both persists in keeping high pressure on fraud crimes, and has targeted the various law enforcement measures, and promotes social governance by developing prosecutor’s recommendations and so on.
The prosecutor’s body strictly applies the facts, the evidence, the proceedings and the application of the law on the basis of the facts, the law on the basis of the line, and does not blame.
In particular, for the crime of telecommunications network fraud, focus on the core role of electronic data in the identification of facts, striving to build a proof chain between electronic data, vocabulary evidence, and documentation.
As the Zhejiang Province of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang Province of Zhejiang
In the review of the arrest and review of the charges, focus on the case’s misconduct prosecution work, correct the security body’s misconduct of 733 people, correct the security body’s misconduct of review of the charges of the same case’s 1113 prisoners.
In the first half of the year, the national prosecutor’s body issued 298 prosecutor’s recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint prevention of fraud crimes and promoting deep-level governance.
For example, with regard to the weaknesses that exist in the telecommunications network regulation found in the case, the Guangzhou City Prosecutor's Office, the Guangzhou City Prosecutor's Office, the Guangzhou City Prosecutor's Office and the Guangzhou City Prosecutor's Office, in order to encourage the relevant units to strengthen the regulation, improve the mechanism, and to promote the construction of the long-efficient system.
Fourth is to do all the effort to pursue losses.
Prosecutor's bodies across the country take into account the important aspects of intervention in investigation, investigation and proceedings, inspect the investigation bodies to actively pay the remuneration, cooperate with the relevant departments to carry out the work of removal of the damage, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crime to the people's crowds.
As the Beijing City Prosecutor's Office deals with a certain set of road loans, the case involves 22 seats of real estate, in the event that the real estate may be dealt with in advance by other cases, initially issued the "sustainable execution letter", forwarded in time to the relevant courts, recommended the previous closing of the court on the real estate in question, until the criminal facts are identified after the unified settlement, to make the greatest effort to recover the real estate in question, to recover the loss of the victim.
The prosecutor reminds all of you that you should be very cautious about the fraud crime, do not expect “the sky falls the crack,” and do not think that it is cheap and easy to believe, keep your own “money pocket.”
Guangzhou Province of Wining County Tuna Town: Reduced Apple Tree Wide the Way to Get Rid of Poverty - China New Network

Cold heat inflammation, Economic Daily - Chinese Economic Network Reporter went to the Middle Sea Village of Tuna in Wining County, Guangzhou.
On the sunshine, the village citizen Li Yuan Li was in the basement, although the face was red, but in the mouth occasionally singing a few small songs.
The town is located in the Wining County, because of low width, high height, lighting enough, day and night temperature difference, the apples produced contain high sugar, taste good, in the surrounding area has a certain reputation, but also because of a small head, more spots, has not been able to sell a good price, has not been able to form the industrial size.
The town was one of the poor villages in the “Pak Valley Yuan Yuan Spring” with a local poverty rate of 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the critical period of fighting against poverty to enter the decisive victory, the change of traditional cultivation habits, the adjustment of the industrial structure, and the increase in farmers’ income is urgent.
Chen Chen and a group of people in the town after several visits believed that industrial development can no longer go the old way.
For this purpose, the town introduced the leading enterprises and cultivated apples in a modern way.
Winning over Agriculture Limited Vice-General Manager Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu
At the beginning, the village mobilized Li Yuan Yuan to turn the land out to plant an apple tree, Li Yuan Yuan and the two in their hearts made a swallow: "Sed so many years of apple, and didn't see in the village who planted an apple gave money."
“The apples that are planted are apples that don’t make the apple tree grow too high.”
To make Lee unthinkable is that this apple planting adopted a new method, irrigation water pipe placed under each apple tree, water and fertilizer together to the root of the tree, in the autumn, when the fruit is collected, the tractor opened directly into the fruit garden, standing and being able to collect the fruit.
Currently, the Apple base has gradually entered the rich-production period, the market also, as Hussein expected, Apple is not disappointed, deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has made Lee's life new changes, although it is still on the ground, but the income has a new source.
Li Yunnan family has more than nine hectares of land flow transferred to the Apple base, each year, in addition to the land flow transfer fee, after holding the fruit, there is also profit division, both spouses are usually working in the base, "one can get 80 yuan per day, all year has work."
Li Yunnan told reporters that last year the profit split received more than 2,800 yuan, as well as the land flow transfer fee as well as the business income of the couples, a family earnings more than 80,000 yuan, "eat without trouble, the days of small welfare have passed."
“At present, the first results are seen, the annual output of 1 hectare of apple is more than 1,50,000, about 10 times the corn.
Chen told reporters that the entire town has now grown 20,000 hectares of apples, only in the Mediterranean village there are 6,000 hectares, covering farmers 4056 houses, 1,72 million people, of which covering the archive of 656 houses, 2,952 people, a year issuing salary is more than 6 million, really achieved the base built at the door of the home, working no need to go out.
Li Yoon忠, who has been increasingly swallowed, also begins to realize his “wish”.
This year, Li Yuan Loyal bought a road car, as today opened the car to work, "Home has a dozen hectares of land, wait for the next step Apple base to expand its size, all flow to them, the income will be more and more.

The membrane separation technology helps break the "greenhouse effect" - China New Network
The membrane separation technology helps to break the "greenhouse effect"
New type of mixed membrane preparation technology demonstrates intention
Today, Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team made significant progress towards "mile separation law capture carbon dioxide", successfully developed a new type of mixed membrane preparation technology, significantly improved the capture performance of membrane material carbon dioxide.
The results have been published as the cover article in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem that disrupts human development, while carbon dioxide emissions are the cause of the greenhouse effect.
How to capture and exploit human emissions effectively is the focus of the attention of scientists.
The "film separation method" is a emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, it separates carbon dioxide gases with the help of the film material, has efficient energy savings and easy operation features.
How to make the film material "deep breath", improving gas separation efficiency, is the difficult point of capturing carbon dioxide by using the film separation method.
Tianjin University research team innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, to explore the effects of different solvents on the membrane gas separation performance.
Experimental results showed that using N-methylpropionate as a prepared solvent, the carbon nanoparticles in the produced membrane materials are distributed more uniformly, "more fluid", effectively improving the efficiency and speed of membrane material gas separation.
With this new technology prepared mixed membrane, the carbon dioxide separation characteristics are close to the current theoretical separation threshold of this type of membrane material.
“The new technology provides new ideas for the film separation method of capturing carbon dioxide.”
Liu Liu, a member of the Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team, said: "We hope that this technology will provide strong support for future coal power plants and chemical enterprises to handle smoke gas and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
Volunteer before filling up first understand what is a professional level bad.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning newspaper Author: by Chongqing Responsibility Editor: by Chongqing
Before volunteering, first understand what is a bad professional level.
Each year, there are students or parents who are volunteer because they do not know the names involved in the volunteer completion, and thus affect the volunteer completion.
This year, Beijing Transport University, Beijing Science and Technology University, Beijing Postal University, Beijing Forest University and Beijing Chemical University jointly announced the 2020 admission policy, eliminating poor professional level.
What does poor professional level mean, what is important in volunteer filling?
There are three methods of professional distribution.
Experts remind that before filling the volunteer, it is necessary to read in detail the “Admission Statutes” of the Heart School, to understand the university’s admission rules, including the file ratio, the professional distribution rules, and so on.
The professional allocation rule, is to refer to after the high school, for professional admission there are mainly professional priorities, score priorities, and professional level disadvantages in three ways.
What specific methods are used by the university will be clear in the Admission Statutes.
But there are also some universities’ admission principles that are overall priority, and there is no disadvantage between professions.
That is to say that the candidates within the enrollment range according to the total ranking, when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer enrollment score line, then see if it has reached the second professional volunteer enrollment score line, with such a push until enrollment to the last professional volunteer, there is no difference between the various professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional level poor" is the university in ordering the candidate specialty, one or more score values published in the Admission Statutes, to determine the selection of different professional volunteer candidates for the admission specialty, this score values is "professional level poor".
That is, the scale difference between the university in receiving the candidate's first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteer, the scale difference between the various professional volunteer levels, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
for example.
Assuming that students submit to A College, examined 560 points, their professional volunteers are respectively: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, A College's professional admission implement a poor professional level method, level difference is 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In the course of the professional distribution, if the first professional volunteer of Xiaomi meets the professional admission requirements and the professional has a planned saldo, then Xiaomi is admitted to the "computer" profession; if the computer is not admitted, then his score will be reduced by 2 points, according to the 558 points of the results with the first professional volunteer to apply for "International Trade" candidate rankings, to determine whether it meets the professional admission conditions; if it is still not satisfied, the score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) to the third professional volunteer "automatized" admission; if it is still not satisfied, the score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) to the fourth professional admission, the subsequent professional will not be reduced by this type.
Different university levels are different.
With the popularity of parallel volunteers, many universities have now eliminated poor professional level, but some universities have still retained this method this year, according to the "Admission Statutes" published by the universities, this year more than 20 universities have set poor professional level.
For example, Shandong University of Agriculture, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology, Shandong University of Technology.
In these universities, each university sets different professional levels.
Some universities have poor levels in each specialty, such as the University of Ningxia, the file has been placed to the school’s candidates, according to the candidate filling the professional volunteer’s order after submission of 1 minute according to the score order of admission.
And some universities, between different disciplines, set different professional levels.
For example, the professional volunteer level difference is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer level is 3 points different from other professional volunteer level, the other professional volunteer level is not bad, is considered parallel volunteer, the other professional volunteer level is 1 point different from the other professional volunteer level.
When filling the volunteer, candidates and parents must read the school’s admission policy carefully, see if there is a poor professional level, the form of the poor level, while considering the score, it is also necessary to reasonably analyze the school and the profession to be selected, if the university in the admission scheme clearly takes the poor level of admission, the candidates in the choice of the profession, to pay attention to the scale between the different professions, to increase the admission rate.

Adults gathered around the US Consulate Police prevented people from "looking too happy"
In response to the U.S. closing of China’s Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closing of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the labels of the US Consulate were removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car drove out of the Consulate in the midst of the streets.

But the inhabitants of a nearby residential building managed to raise a giant Chinese flag on their own balcony and scream the slogan of supporting China.
The Chengdu Consulate was opened in 1985 and covers all U.S. consular affairs in the southwestern China, especially the Tibetan Autonomous Region.

Currently, in addition to Chengdu, the United States in China has also consulat in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan, and Hong Kong.
