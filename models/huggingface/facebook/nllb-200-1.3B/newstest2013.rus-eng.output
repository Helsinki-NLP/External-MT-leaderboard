Republican strategy of resistance to Obama 's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center dismisses the latter as a myth, claiming that fraudulent elections in the United States are rarer than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discrediting the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the US.
That's why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that make it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 elections, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed in 41 states restricting the right to vote.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register as a voter on the day of the vote and deprive citizens with criminal record of the right to vote.
Until the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a law passed in Indiana in 2008.
Republican authorities quickly extended this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they've initiated bills requiring voters to show photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
The cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Student voters who are considered to be voting for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school in several states.
But those same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mostly Republican, to use the voting cards issued by those clubs.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
This was the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the voting of Latinos.
It is estimated that two-thirds of the Latino voters vote for the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction has not gone without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election, a campaign to register voters helped put some 10 million people on the electoral rolls.
Meanwhile, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the level of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of early voters were African-American, although African-Americans made up only 13% of the state's total voters.
The same thing happened with the Latin-Americans.
While they represented only 11% of the electorate, they made up 24% of the citizens who voted early.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, had only 46% of the early voters.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to passing laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended by the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This has allowed us to partially limit the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring photo IDs.
However, the new rules that have come into force will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from the Democrats have condemned the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing them as clearly aimed at influencing the results of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discrediting the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives false, false-negative, and sometimes false-positive results, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men who are reluctant to go through a dispensary have even more to be suspicious of.
To take the test or not?
We asked two experts.
Studies in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so the data are difficult to interpret and difficult to formulate any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found different mortality rates in those who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, those who didn't get screened were 30 to 40 percent more likely to have metastases.
So I would recommend starting testing at age 50, or 40, if you have a direct relative with prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and slow-moving.
You need to explain to the patient the extent of his risk of cancer, offering him options, not necessarily treating prostate cancer, which is not life-threatening in the long run, but making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and not life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start treatment.
More and more, we are setting the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I would recommend taking the test anyway.
But it's also important to consult your doctor to determine whether you should take this test.
In collaboration with the International Urological Association, Movember has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of passing the PSA test.

Preventing the Sick
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It's estimated that if everyone ate healthy and exercised enough, 30 percent of all cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked anymore, this number would rise to at least 50 percent", points out André Bolier, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 percent of cancers are hereditary.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Association continues to make smoking a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it's a risk factor for many others.
It's a huge threat to human health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", says press secretary André Bolier.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer", adds the association.
Food and nutrition
The association also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
Too much of it increases the risk of colon cancer.
You should also avoid sausage products.
Meat preservation by cooking, drying, or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer", explains the Association.
The vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at this point, the results of these studies are not definitive.
According to the SCC, the vitamin E studies are contradictory.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, the other one showed the opposite.
The impact of vitamin D on cancer development is also not entirely clear.
However, Mr. Pain emphasizes that it is important to discuss your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Failure to pass the test does not lead to cancer".
The Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, news that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused quite a stir - and for good reason.
This boson is thought to explain the mass of all the particles in the universe, no more, no less.
It's also the last particle predicted by the Standard Model -- our best, or at least "least perfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter -- but it's never been detected experimentally before.
But physicists aren't quite sure that it's the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data are not yet complete.
But let's say it's a Higgs boson, because the chances of it being wrong seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is absolutely unavoidable, that no two things can be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way around this rule, and don't even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But even though particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it has one law of its own: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment in time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" is, in their common features, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called Fermions who are reasonably obedient to Pauli's principle.
In the other, there are bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything -- at least for that principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the (incredibly unusual) Particle Adventure website at Berkeley Laboratories, these bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and "force particles", which are the primary forces of nature and are sort of related to the Higgs boson.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly mundane boson: a photon, or "light particle", which is a "courier" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" comes an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, except for that boson to come into existence, another field, the Higgs field, has to be broken.
But the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, like a frozen pond, whose surface can only be shaken by a very large rock.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one that's being used at CERN -- the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 kilometers -- to achieve such huge energies.
The electromagnetic field analogy is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others don't: a sheet of paper, for example, will never stick on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) don't.
So what can all this research "bring", asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they're used to test the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to detect discrepancies between the results of observations and the predictions of the SM.
And some of them are eager for such discrepancies to be discovered, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door to "new physics" and plug some of the holes in the Model.
The latter, I have to say, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh-oh!).
But CERN hasn't found any such discrepancies.
The consequences
The benefits of this research for the everyday life of the average person are harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is none.
Look, back in the early '60s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs couldn't have imagined what a revolution their work would bring.
They envisioned their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally seen as more of a "laboratory gadget".
Can you imagine?
And also, there's an app for the study toolkit.
For example, the same William Boyle, in his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not at all what it was originally intended to be, is now the "eye" for all the digital cameras in the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This doesn't mean that the Large Hadron Collider will change our lives, of course, but it just shows, in fact, that anything is possible.
Palliative care is the best way to die.
The Quebec Commission for Death with Dignity recently discussed the delicate issue of end of life.
The debate should resume soon, and the bill is being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this vital area.
"Dog" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, which had destroyed him from the inside, gave him a two-year deferment.
"I was given five years, I lived seven", he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the Victor Gadboa palliative care home in Bely, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, and you can't prepare for it", he says.
The disease is doing its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet or even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with a delicious meal, he gives in and agrees to be helped to eat.
He's got a sense of humor, he's even able to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage in the face of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, which is humiliating", he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"We've been taught throughout our lives that a man should urinate standing up", says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbois.
Regressing to the point of childhood is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"It all depends on the ability of the individual" to cope with decline, he says.
Because, according to many people in palliative care, important events happen at the height of the decline.
The patients who come to Victor Gadboue's palliative care are all cancer patients.
The prognosis is they'll live for three months at most.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides what is called "medical" care.
Mrs. A., 89, fears most of all that she will die "conscious from suffocation".
But the disease has allowed me to get to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life", she says before allowing a breathing mask to be put on her.
She is still waiting for the last visit of her son, who has arrived from Italy, in the coming days.
A group of volunteers provide care and nutrition at Victor Gadboa.
This is palliative care, which is what you get when there's nothing more you can do.
To make it more comfortable to die.
In Quebec, one place in a palliative care facility is needed for every 11,700 residents.
That's not much, considering we're all gonna die sooner or later.
Life here continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the hospice's doctors.
Whether it's physical comfort, emotional comfort or mental comfort.
We'll agree to give the dying person a mouthful of brandy or pepsi, whichever he asks for.
We don't make diabetics control their sugar anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
His son finished his beer at the dead man's feet this morning.
"We help our loved ones as well as our patients", says Nathalie Savar, director of patient care.
At Victor Gadboa, no day is the same.
Next to the 93-year-old man enjoying his last meeting with his family in the courtyard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies a young man of 36 years, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children and who tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age", says Dr. Christian Martel, with concern.
53% of patients admitted to Victor Gadboa come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stages of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And some institutions, like Victor Gadboué and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, are more or less exclusively dedicated to cancer care.
It is this huge gap in Quebec's health care system that has many palliative care physicians fearful of passing legislation legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulated signed by the brightest in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not efficient enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is authorized.
She says: "I recently saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in excruciating pain, and no one took the necessary steps to relieve her.
I'm afraid that patients want to die only because they're not getting adequate care.
Meanwhile, many oncologists are working to the last day to save patients despite the pessimistic predictions.
Helen Richard's chances of survival were already slim when she stopped the exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight", she says.
And she told me that my days were numbered!
There is no cure.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who ask to die thank the nurses for not granting their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not the absolute all-powerful way to combat pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are not sensitive to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient sleeps until the moment of death, either occasionally or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who cannot relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die".
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized", it means "I want to feel better".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The massive real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political party fundraisers, and Italian mafia experts tell us day after day what they know about the colossal "system" that engulfs the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists, and the mobsters.
"Industry" which has been very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how this system falls apart after all the resources have been put into it", jokes Jacques Duchene, MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was his role in the scandal that erupted in 2011 as a byproduct of an investigation into official misconduct involving road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chare agreed to very reluctantly.
The Dushen Report established a direct link between industry, the secret funding of political parties, and corruption.
"Since the investigation began in 2010, he points out, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts" if some had restrained their instincts to take a stake.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already removed two mayors", he adds, hoping it will "uncover the schemes behind individual personalities".
The Permanent Division for the Fight against Corruption, established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011 and included a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the Hammer Special Unit, who after 2009 forced the Montreal liquor cartel to stop overvaluing contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richar Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next in line is Gilles Vaïencure, who recently retired as mayor of Laval, the third-largest city in Quebec.
He's suspected of multiple bribery charges in connection with the placement of government contracts.
In addition, several Montreal highway engineers and Italian-born construction contractors, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts signed in Montreal to a certain mafia-linked intermediary who, in turn, transferred money to Mayor Gerald Trumbull's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito was running money from left to right, transferring more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to illegally collecting funds for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normand.
Sewer contracts that overestimated the value
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working flawlessly.
Gil Surprenan, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the commission: over the course of ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and bribes totaling $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, which he overstated.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they were getting a kick in the butt by overcharging 30-40% with fake surcharges.
Then one of the mayor's party organizers, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trumbull of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that was filling the party coffers with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of Rivière de Prairie on the east side of the island, she's been opposing the sale of municipal land since 2010, bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers in the midst of the construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually begin, she will "pull the rope to understand the functioning of the ant-infested system to stop gangrene and identify the culprits".
She characterizes this process as "painful but positive".
We're in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid a recurrence of questionable practices.
We're cleaning the house.
It's a regular thing.
Jacques Duchamp, for his part, notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme" but who were not involved in the machinations.
Given that dirty money accounts for 70 percent of Quebec's election finances, he jokes: "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government is proposing to limit party donations to $100, but he says that won't change the situation: "Until we strictly limit election spending, politics will be dirty money".
He demands a complete restructuring of the system of government contracts and party financing: "We cannot go any lower; by boldly delving into the essence of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality".
If this story does cast a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchamp urges those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You've made a remarkable progress at PSG this season.
How would you explain this growth?
This could be explained by individual consciousness, but it could also be a new dimension of the PTSD.
The great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors keep me up-to-date every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
In football, things happen very quickly.
But I'm not on fire.
From the beginning at the NIF Pre-Training Centre in Clairfontaine until my arrival at St. Etienne, I was always moving forward.
So you're taking advantage of the competition set by Carlo Ancelotti...
It's not a new thing to play very high-level matches this summer.
They also know that every workout is important.
It's what makes a player like me want to be on the level and give it his best shot.
And Carlo Ancelotti is supporting my position.
He's got a few substitutes like Claude Macqualle who played the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
- Of course you do.
Ancelotti is respectful of all the technical staff.
He's the best coach in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with top-tier clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had a very encouraging conversation with him in January.
I was recovering from a series of injuries.
The trust he places in me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first half of the PSG season?
Lyon has taken our lead in the Premier League.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the last eight.
What is the club's goal in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
We can say our word face to face with some very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, to be able to take a replay in the eighth final.
Can PSG become a top-class European club in the short term?
He's got a budget for that.
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure positions for the long term.
Today is not.
PSJ has the financial means to make this project a reality.
Not winning the Premier League title like last season, would that be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
We came close to that last season.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually, 79 points is the championship.
But the other team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's going to be okay.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's normal that we're expected to do a lot, given how much we've invested and the players we have.
We're fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troya and we're still being criticized for something, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves what people want first.
We're never gonna win every weekend 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game plan.
The team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can meet the challenges of today.
Look at Manchester United, who have failed to make it to the last eight for two seasons, even though they've spent a lot of money!
With all the money we've invested, we've got you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not on top last season, were "awakened" by this new PSG.
It just shows how exciting the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say to ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have won.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of "gold addiction"?
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He's here for this and he's proving he's a star in the Premier League.
Everywhere he played, he showed he was a great player and a star on a global scale.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
It encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
I really wanted to be in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from taking some playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
I 'm getting good qualifying matches today .
This is what I've been hoping for since I was baptized by the Blues.
We've learned from what happened in Ukraine, and we need to act like it now.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first few months in charge of the Blues?
They're working for him.
He's in a good spot in the World Cup qualifiers.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and he inspires them to win.
What Lauren Blanc was like.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he has qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved 1-1 draw in Spain on October 16th is a fundamental match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before the shock in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current money exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties and commission fees for processing them.
And as is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, which is based on banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a secure BitTorrent-like exchange protocol that allows for file exchange between participants of one level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered from 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand websites accept bitcoins for donations or as payment.
The bitcoin price, which peaked at $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits" used for promotion in a video game, which are earned in-game or can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations are always controlled and processed by some central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually happens between two email addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file make it possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger that is distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to register the new transaction in this ledger.
It goes through a mathematical problem, sent to the computers, and the person who solves it, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
It's the phase of hashing a file, which is converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number to it before they hash it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, other nodes can easily check that it's correct.
The transaction is thus inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If a user wanted to pay twice with the same money in a very short time (less than ten minutes) for the purpose of cheating, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly halved, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the problem also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the network has had its ups and downs.
Sites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked, and Bitcoin reserves were stolen.
"The flaw is not in the protocol itself", assures Pierre Nouza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, allow it.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoin is not in circulation.
The "giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nouza, another author of the currency manual, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile phone payment, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who don't need to install new devices or software.
Just provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, says Pierre Nouza, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to overlook hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin is established, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB's report proposes, incidentally, to reconsider the various risks which are considered to be high today, should this system succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapiza and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow suit in late 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just relying on us.
We've been targeting mostly Afghan peasants, who we've been treating as terrorists.
And we, with 88 soldiers dead, wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies, as was the case in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will be gone once the West behaves more delicately.
The French retreat from the Niger base, which I observed from the hills covered with almond trees thanks to French loans, was orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles escorted by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014 , there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul .
Things have changed since their insurmountable promotion from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of fighting between different groups.
Taking control of the country was seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid the price for the obscurity of these peasants, which was surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They became dealers, taking over government land to sell it for development to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, haven't even been to war themselves.
People, I hear, in the countryside want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have been able to leave through American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are full of both boys and girls.
We must provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the gloom of the old parties or the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves cell phones, TV and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world, and they watch them everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities that command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who were waging the anti-Soviet struggle, were already taking measures to restore provincial troops that would not be subordinate to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent, following the pattern of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially ahead of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, has been dependent on foreign aid.
Industry has not been restored, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan had enormous mineral wealth.
It only reinforced the feeling that the Western countries were there to take over.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground, without means of transportation to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynac copper deposit, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, should return to normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a high school for girls, for boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "military-civilian activity" service under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was disbanded in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, helped contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of arable land.
What will we leave behind for our memories, spending two billion euros on military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Kapisa Province.
To get rid of the foreign-led insurgency, which the farmers want, as they told me, is to give them a little non-military support that is well-controlled and goes directly to them.
The Difficult Births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is another risky move by President Mohamed Morsi.
With Egypt more divided than ever, over the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he decided to play the wa-ban.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two more months to finish the work.
For almost two years, Egypt has relied on a draft text that has been amended several times, which has weakened institutional stability and led to legal conflicts.
This new initiative only exacerbated the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "break the word" and "trample on the law".
His followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which forced the Brothers to abandon their intention of explaining to the Egyptians, article by article.
It's also a way for the president to restore public and democratic legitimacy while discontent rages across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote yes, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I reserve extraordinary powers", which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to make their point.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
To reach the required quorum, 11 people, the backup participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, most articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day occurred around... the time of the prayer, as some committee members felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were mis-set.
The text, which was voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of public attention, Article 2, ultimately remained the same article from the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the primary source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow their more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", say the liberals, who see it as just publicity.
Because they think the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, particularly in checking compliance with Sharia law.
Egypt expert Sophie Pomme said this was alarming because "the people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can see the birth of theocracy".
Many liberals, moreover, are upset that the next president of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious intervention at this time.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but people with university education, some of them trained in the French system", reassures Alexis Bloy, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "there may be ambiguity around Article 220, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies particularly to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to make decisions about this".
Apart from its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they have significantly decreased compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention is the military's authority.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the defense budget will be considered not in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will the military court be banned from prosecuting civilians, despite the pleas of human rights groups.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider detrimental to freedom.
Blasphemy is still a liability, and insulting is now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles speak about women's protection anymore, points out Heba Moraef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
A word that didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Poop of the Earth and the sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comforts, and the primordial nature of the earth.
The AIF has identified the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let us worship the holy places
You should be at the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter this "bath" are granted divine favor.
And Galilee is the place where Jesus performed miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm, and filling nets.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But most of all, Jerusalem is holy.
Here believers walk the Way of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony - the Praetorium - where the court was, and leads down the streets of the Old City to the Temple of the Lord's Tomb on Mount Golgotha - the place of the Crucifixion, the Anointing Stone, and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pump of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is built on the site where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which Jesus was crucified grew.
The Jewish holy place in Jerusalem is the Wailing Wall, a remnant of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes here with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Make a trip to the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Massada are left over from the secret refuge from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the rocks in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are passionate about climbing can reach them by walking.
The rest are taken to this historic peak by a cable car.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus takes him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the mountain ski trails is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, the mountain was supposedly inhabited by pagan gods.
Visiting the most unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go all the way in one trip.
But at least five of the most interesting are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is worth a visit.
The exhibition is widely represented by the paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Bash bath museum, which is a collection of several halls of ancient Turkish baths with mulages of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, you can visit the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are strictly forbidden.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - the children's memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, and you're in complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is mentioned there too.
Get well
Israel's three main resort areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of these has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is a place where people swim even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air is warmer at 23 degrees Celsius.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is located at the lowest point on the planet - 417 meters below sea level.
The blue water is brine, which keeps even those who cannot swim at all afloat.
The scenery around here is incredibly beautiful.
They come here to take a course of salt water treatment, rap, and curative mud, and to heal dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to repair the nerves that are shaken.
Touching the Mysteries of the Ancient World
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the city of Joppa on the Mediterranean coast.
It was the famous Sea Route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls of the street with your own sign, fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even from other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea, the city of Herod the king, you can wander through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist for the note
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: in the country, about 30% of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money for the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easily exchanged for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
It's basically an underground funicular.
The cost of all city transport is 6 shekels, which means that you can change places within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transportation are closed.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offer only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, skinned fish, and meat-and-milk dishes.
There is a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus, a variety of sauces, ground beef balls - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are plenty of fed cats that are just "walking by themselves".
At night, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The morons like to be in the public and they don't refuse to be served.
The rental car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus the insurance, $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost 15 cents a day.
Museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
In the language of numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by over three million tourists from all over the world.
The most travelers and vacationers were citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
Between January and October 2012, 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, 51% more than in 2010, before the visa ban on February 9, 2011.
"Great and Mighty" will take you to Moscow: migrants are making money on the tongue
While MPs and human rights activists are debating what will be the law on compulsory language testing, there are already scammers selling "lip" certificates in the country
Each year, 13 million tourists come to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force, according to which every migrant worker will be obliged to pass a Russian language test.
For now, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the service, housing and utilities, household and retail sectors.
But in time, the FMS promises, testing will become mandatory for all arrivals.
And you'll have to pass not only the language, but also Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
You will need to prove your language skills both for obtaining and renewing your work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People who had received certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by the law.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examining points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the SPbDU and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law was passed, human rights activists had many times asked the press: What does it mean?
What will change the language requirement for both Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the immigration officials say, it will reduce the number of people who suffer from "labor slavery".
Many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Seblev, head of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
Their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
The problems are with migrants who have no profession, no education, no language, no medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, he believes, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will stick him with a "trailer" into a creepy, cramped barracks, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, working 12-14 hours a day.
We're getting a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive they are deceived, their passports are taken away, they are not paid the promised salary", - confirms the head of the Main Department of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't you swear, resident!
However, many Central Asian citizens who are going to Russia to work admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they are going to, but also have difficulty writing in their own.
Of course, it's not so much their fault as their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a basic education.
Their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone to dress them properly, dress them, and equip them for school.
Growing up into adolescence, these kids go to work as soon as they can.
It is difficult if you are not good at the language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and unworthy".
However, there is one important point that human rights activists are noting about the language law.
Testing will only be done for those migrants who have legal status.
If you don't have a status, there's no exam, no official job.
Meanwhile, most of the tourists still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or foreigners are not allowed".
Many of the newcomers claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But you can get a fake registration quick and for as little as $1,500.
The Russian police know that we have mostly fake IDs, no registration, hence the extortion cases.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", Tajikistan citizen Umed Khushkadamov shared with journalists.
"Fly in, don't be greedy, buy painting"
On the first day of the language law, it became clear that not only immigration registration documents are fake.
Several "lippish" language test certificates have already been confiscated by the FMS.
The fake paper is printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they were not given to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to make the test easier, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
It's more than twice as expensive as the official testing procedure: it costs a migrant worker three thousand.
The fact that the main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "steps" cannot be bought, is the consensus of both government officials and human rights activists.
Meanwhile, the authorities can promise those who failed the test at first that they will have time to learn a basic language course.
In addition, those who do not speak Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take the illegal arms market into circulation
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is proposing tougher laws for civilian gun owners.
This is the authorities' reaction to recent incidents: the shooting of Nazhda at weddings, when no victims were killed, and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, in which Nazhda killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of a gun in public and raise the age at which a gun can be licensed from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "turning the screws".
An open letter appeared on the Internet, in which the authors - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demanded that the "senseless tightening" be abandoned.
The percentage of registered gun violence is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the BBC Russian Service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms were committed in the six months of 2012, while 1168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not place the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, they say, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims to be monitoring the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is being replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the website that takes orders for weapons
The first is "army or military trace", i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were carried by Russian officers and by Caucasians themselves", says Baranec.
The next type of "black weapon" is the one that criminals steal from law enforcement.
Ramenez explains that this includes both stolen from police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
The illegal "spoils" are sold from the military warehouses.
Many military warehouses were frequently bombed.
"There are proven versions that some of the arson was done on purpose - to cover up the shortfall", says the former military man.
The weapons manufacturers are contributing, according to Barantz.
"Now private arms factories are being built, which cannot withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow", the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
The bulk of the imports are from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed, which organized the flow", explains the former soldier.
Where'd you get the guns?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
The report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Management Design in 2011.
The experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian State Statistics Agency, the criminological literature and the open data of the portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers write, come from the military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all the guns on the black market ended up there "by the fault of officials whose work is related to guns", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% are stolen during the production of weapons, and 5% are from "black archaeology".
A sales consultant at one gun store, who asked not to be named, said the weapons the black diggers found had been out of circulation for years - too old.
Mostly, he says, the salesmen go to the military warehouse for the new batch.
A man buys a unit through a probation officer, like a TT gun.
He gets it, he gets it through the diaphragm.
"He takes it to the city and sells it here for 900 euros a piece with two shops", he says.
"It's true that the police are aware of all the cases, so they periodically conduct control purchases from illegal arms dealers when they burn the crime detection plan", the consultant adds.
"Like a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer usually find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at websites, blogs, until a friend answered, and he offered to come to the Running Platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the corner, where we would trade.
I only learned the price of the barrel there.
Victor Baranez , the military observer
"I have a friend who has a way out", says the sales consultant. "But I'm not sure he does.
There are vendors in the markets, but you have to come there too, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell you that his daughter's tooth fell out".
I'm even getting a couple of casts right now through someone I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me, too, because he knows I'm not gonna turn him in.
Rookies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranez tried himself as an illegal gun buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about it.
The patterns, he says, haven't changed.
They gave him a photo album with "anything" in it.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Barantz, is not offered a cat in a bag - you can try anything.
I, the prospect, don't just buy, we go with the salesman into the woods, we set a target.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm sure the weapon is good, we start a bargain", the expert describes the procedure.
The sofa shop.
Search engines on the Internet lead to sites and groups on Vkontakte, where people are offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No papers or face-to-face meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", says the advertising cap on the website "Buy a combat pistol or machine gun".
Users leave applications and ask questions.
And the minors?
"Without a license of course", asks user "Ivan" (spelling is preserved).
"I'm buying T.T. Moscow", is the short form of the Fedorenko request.
The F.B.I. has now unleashed a vast network of bogus websites that seek to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they mine coal in Siberia.
military observer and former military Victor Baranez
I've heard of schemes like this: usually a website registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer makes the payment through the ATM.
"They send a photo and instructions where the weapons are hidden", says Dmytro Kislov, spokesman for the public organization "Right to Arms".
Victor Baranez claims that by leaving a request on the website, you can be left without a weapon and go to jail.
The F.B.I. has now unleashed a vast network of bogus websites that seek to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish for food, and then they mine coal in Siberia", he says.

Experts estimate that the cost of buying illegal firearms can range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Right to Arms", Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.

According to the official statistics of the department, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers go on strike in the US
A quarter of all American teenagers go through a McDonald's job.
In recent days, a wave of low-wage protests have swept across America at Walmart department stores and popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will become a wave nine or whether it will be extinguished in the early stages.
The action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries of ordinary employees of Walmart and the fast food system, the protestors' goal is to create union organizations in the cities.
So far, this sector of the economy is barely covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, when America was rocked by a cheap-selling orgy that drew millions of commuters and sometimes involved brawls.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and joined unions and left-wing activists in picketing the stores of the company, whose products are designed for the low- and middle-income.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners and eggs and milk.
The products in his stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-wage Walmart employees are only bullied at work.
The availability and variety of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell goods at a lower price in part because it pays its workers less.
The latter also complain about the harsh working conditions, such as the lack of auto-loaders or hand-held scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded higher salaries and complained that the cost of corporate health insurance had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.50 an hour, they said, couldn't afford it.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she spends on her salary now.
If Walmart were to shift all of the payroll growth onto the shoulders of the customers, it would cost them only 46 cents more per visit.
They're going to spend about $12.39 more than they do now in a year.
Walmart supporters are quite remarkable that the protests have occurred in only nine states and have not caused the corporation the slightest damage.
Black Friday ran from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Walmart spokesman Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that "fewer than five" Walmart employees had quit their jobs, and that the protest was just "another PR stunt" by the union that organized it.
"Free cash!" It was a big deal.
Protests continued this week in New York City, where they were not targeted at Walmart department stores (they are not advertised in this progressive city, so they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!
Jumeine Williams, member of the New York City Council
The minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is currently $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants raise it over time, but not by much, and the average hourly wage for their regular workers in New York City is $8.90.
They're the lowest paid people in this expensive city.
How you can survive in New York on that kind of money is beyond me.
Once, McDonald's was the place where nearly a quarter of all American teenagers worked after school, while living at home.
Few saw it as their main source of food or planned to stay there for long.
Now I'm constantly interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even feed their kids.
On the other hand, there's a commentary on the Wall Street Journal forum, where the author notes that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protest, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this and punishing union activists with harassment and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But the union's inclusion of fast food is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary fluidity of the footage.
The Disagreeable
Noisy protests were held that day at a number of other Manhattan's cheap restaurants.
The event culminated in a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, attended by several local Democratic politicians, including City Councilman Jumeine Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you sick days and pay you for honest work!"
The protesters were joined by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who declared that "we must stand together in support of fast food workers to achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest such action in the history of American fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were employees of the fast-food restaurant that employs tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It's not clear if this spark will ignite a mass movement.
"As long as you're fooling the brain, you're doing average".
The topic of augmented reality, which is popular among modern technology enthusiasts, has recently been perceived primarily through the prism of special glasses.
Google first showed the current model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had filed an application for a corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with Sharam Izadi, head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft Cambridge Labs, it appears that the company's scientists have already passed the glass.
They're driven by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell me in general what your research group is doing?
We're doing human-machine interaction, but we're trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
While humanity in general is stuck in the phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes tapping them with your finger.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and predict the dramatic changes in these interactions.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without the Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is in store?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has moved interaction to the physical level, a lot of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system gets more data), and the output is not much.
We're trying to change that, working on true three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective.
We need to bring the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
But to do that, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient way.
And first of all, screw these stupid VR helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea - there's a privacy issue, because you don't always want to let people know about your actions and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of computer interactions are good, but each one is in its own niche.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, not big ones, but these cheap, short ones.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It's big, but theoretically, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But the future is a mixed control, like gesture plus voice.
- What's that?
- Like, how are you gonna ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it and show it.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be hard to tell.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual bond.
I think that in the near future, we're going to have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
It could be, like, laser sensors, they give a good depth resolution, which is very important.
Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something?
- Basically, the current generation is what we're going to start with in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 rpm.
But it's not the megapixels themselves, it's the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In the end, all the current technology is not good enough for us -- it adds to the work of the algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the X and Y resolution, but the Z.
Also very important is speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betisches at our Redmond lab has made a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects human-machine interaction.
I could use the equivalent of this device in my work, but it doesn't require touch, so it's a lot more frame per second.
- Shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other one is a reflector.
And the third camera is actually a normal visual range sensor.
It's not used to determine depth.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or aggravate it by increasing the amount of calculation required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play around with the camera curvature and see how that helps in 3D positioning.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not released its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technology, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, walking around with your smartphone up in your hands isn't very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "transitional" augmented reality, where you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display, and so on, on a cloud-based platform.
Glasses are a very personal device, and that's their strength (you're the only one who can see private things), and at the same time, their weakness is that augmented reality based on glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects with other people.
- Let's imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but to ordinary mortals.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tactile feedback!
My hands feel nothing!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth one might be the addition of tactile senses.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of backing for the image.
She's a great push-pull recorder!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" a touch -- for example, interfering with a few directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where your finger is, it gives a feeling, but it's very faint right now -- like you're being blown on a pillow.
And there are wristbands that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is another promising area.
- You tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he's supposed to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
There's another challenge that we're going to have to fight for a long time -- how to make a person, physically in a very limited space, believe that they're walking in the open, practically infinite -- and we're working on the concept of running tracks (not quite like in clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
As long as the brain is being deceived on average, the work is still very much for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher -- a lot of things are in a very rudimentary state.
A taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Peterburg Avant-Garde", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top-list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the all-Russian fame.
The new hero of the Rosebalt is the epigramist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in all red, who is seen at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, at the fashion parties and the vernix.
Cyril Miller's paintings always attract a crowd wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social-philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
He's also a city man, appearing in the streets to make people smile, to lift everyone's spirits.
He recently took up the charm and became the St. Petersburg charmer, as he was ripe for this difficult role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you go around town in red instead of yellow or purple, for example?
I chose red as a fashion designer for the look and feel.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray is a source of aggression and the arousal of a bad trait.
But my provocations are meant to start a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were going to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the Nevskiy district, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old, free, informal artists passed, and the new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, the post-Gaznovist, which led to Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
She throws me into theater, clothes, music, everything but words.
It was important for me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I took over the territory at Pushkinskaya-10, and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, a house of the St. Petersburg bohemian until it was renovated.
Many were born there: WE, Tequila Jazz, I remember when they brought in the String with Van Gogh's Ear.
Snour and his friends sang light songs under the fan, they were in a tight t-shirt, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the Hali-Galiv era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and he went on to have a great career, and he got his basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboedov" - these are echoes of the Art-clinic.
That's where our workers and staff went.
I'm a hero of a century ago, when culture was important.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, and the award was People of Our City.
I was nominated for Artist of the Year, and my climax was over.
In the new times, it's uncomfortable to work by the old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to be popular these days, but culture and popularity are separate, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is characteristic of manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a vivid sense of timeliness and sharpness.
I'm having a program exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, but now it's painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything is blurred, tragedy is removed.
I like the grotesque, I have the grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian disguise in order.
Now, people are looking at the clothes, focusing on the outer mechanics, not the inner person.
Maybe he shouldn't be held and spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed by the change of clothes.
And recently, we saw you as the city charmer.
Who else would be?
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Commercial art now should be neat, tactful, sweet.
There's a disintegration of cultures going on.
People used to fight in packs, bohemians liked one thing, simpletons another.
Now everyone's broken into microcommunities, so it's hard to like everybody.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to be liked by everyone.
Now we have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov is coming in by the thousands!
- He gets the allowances, the sex-social sphere works.
And on the cultural level, 300 people will come and 10,000 won't, and it's less management, less money, it's all going to go down.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin what I've earned.
I painted so many pictures when I was young, that one of the collectors had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually end with.
It's a lot of confusion these days.
They say culture is spiritual, culture is consumer.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of culture from yesterday, raised by the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, giving up money to paint pictures.
I'm for that culture.
- Cyril, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a term for that: a cultural officer.
But not all of them can do culture.
The right kings didn't have that, the kings may not have been very knowledgeable about culture, but they understood that you need to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're being pushed back, because we need higher-level experts who can properly evaluate these experts and give them a path.
The tasting room is booming.
The same Errata, but the difference is that they honestly say that we don't accept all contemporary art, there are artists who have to find other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow culture is much more, there is soil.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural base, and we have more writers than readers now, which is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of tonic.
We need to make art as fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the help of a grant from Saint Petersburg
To give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a killer asteroid collision.
Caravans of spacecraft with Earthlings on board are on their way to find a spare planet.
The question is, how do we keep our species alive in a gravity-free environment or on the same planet?
I think the choice is limited.
There are only two real planets that we can explore, hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Surdin, senior research fellow at the P.K. Shternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAIS).
But if Mars is more habitable, then the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
The only way to live is at high altitude or in orbit around Venus... in space.
The first thing we did was to look at the flora.
Half a century ago, they did experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then there's the release of insects into orbit, tiny fruit flies, drosofils.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how an embryo develops in weightless conditions.
We get a perfectly normal chick.
And then the problem starts.
"The problem is that this puppy has to find a support, it has to get up on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find support, the chicks crept about in disorder.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks didn't respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, after four days, they were dead.
"We hatched the chicks twice, then we refused because it was impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev, who said the experiment with chicks in space failed.
The last time a biological miniature went into orbit with animals was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the Bion will only be used by individuals of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with a fruit.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"This was done on biosatellites, but again, this is a one-off experiment, and such studies should be conducted", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But we can't really approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their familiar habitat, simply cannot fulfill their sexual instincts.
Humans, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens have an abstract mind, and are able to create the appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, these experiments are not conducted.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
Tereshkova took the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive the flight into space.
Whether she can have a baby after this flight.
"No one answered that question", says veteran rocket and space industry officer Vakhtang Vakhadadze.
In June 1964, just a year after the first woman astronaut, Valentina Tereshkova, flew into space, she gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savicka, who had been to orbit twice and even worked in the open space, had a son.
But the risk remains.
We have a few, a few astronauts who have survived long flights, and a healthy generation is growing up.
"If it is more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights", sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, creating artificial gravity.
The hydrological laboratory of the CPC is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in a zero-float environment, astronauts are training their skills in open space.
Water is imitating weightlessness.
If water is a comfortable but alien environment for adults, it is a natural environment for infants.
Little ichthandrae seem to confirm that life on land came from the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby is in the mother's amniotic fluid for about nine months, and it's easier for him to get used to the water.
And that makes sense, because from the moment you're born, from the moment you're first bathed, it's only two weeks.
"It's not much to forget", says Marina Aksenova, a swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for the child to be born, then gravity is needed for the woman, gravity.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falling ability to push the fetus.
Okay, let's drop that, too, relying on the birth control pills.
You can, of course, go into a special delivery room, she'll push him out.
"And what next?" - asks Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the baby needs artificial gravity, too.
Without the gravitational pull of the earth, the body cannot form a skeleton and a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is not as likely as an adult to be dressed in a special training suit.
He'll just be deprived of everything he needs in life.
"This experiment, which we will do with you, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely de-adapted person", - predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the IMBP of the Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov.
For now, having babies in space is a matter of theory.
However, in time, this will become a reality when Earthlings in their ships travel to a distant planet that will become home to their spacemen-born offspring.
Chief Control and Audit Officer: The check on the schwarz system failed because of the politicians.
The Czech Republic has good control bodies in the public procurement sector and, despite having good legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kal, Vice President of the Supreme Control and Audit Office, from an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack", commented Kala on the current situation.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nechas' approach to the so-called Schwarz system is cited.
The Prime Minister recently said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is that prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be somehow established, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot stand in the way of the institutions that are charged with checking and enforcing the obligations", Kala states.
At the House of Representatives' audit committee meeting, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What exactly was that about?
I mean, the parallel investigation that we started, like, two years ago.
In other words, European legislation sets out how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then also the application in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with the unfinished check, interesting differences have been found - in simple terms, we may have "accurate and error-free" legislation, but in practice we are inferior to Germany in some parameters.
This means that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, we need to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how exactly can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of collaborative control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But the fact is, we're not going to get there by lowering the order limit.
Perhaps this system will be overwhelmed with paperwork, so that those who want to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the constraint were not lowered.
You're talking about the internal problems of the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRU, or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof is our central accounting office, which is organized according to our principles, and there is also a board that operates in a slightly different way, but basically both institutions function in the same way.
In addition, the powers are similar to a certain extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are also audit units at the federal land level - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have state resources.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal accounting chambers.
As far as the local laws are concerned, are they easier than ours?
I don't want to compare without data, but in some ways Germany is a good example, but you can't say that it's better in everything.
Is it because they're better at controlling?
Certainly not, but I repeat, I don't like comparisons like that.
But I have to say, even the best countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any benefit from working with our office, would they?
As for domestic legislation, how has the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution, are there any implications?
Given the fact that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been shown in our control work.
Since we're running a fact-checking, we need to account for some delay.
We're only taking this into account in the process of preparing future audits -- we've started using our new tool of "disability risk detection", through which we've driven out almost 14,000 government contracts. We've analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will be visible, because the restrictions are changing, the terms of certain types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you think that passing this bill will be a benefit or an additional burden on the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be upheld.
The problem that could arise is that the rules will get tougher and impossible to follow.
Under the previous rules, the controlled enterprises are bound to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - to the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budget discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think that's the way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let's face it, this is not going anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently said that the GDR would not disturb businessmen with the so-called Schwarz system.
Is the Schwarz System allowed or prohibited?
The law should be laid down in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister cannot stand in the way of the bodies that are charged with checking and enforcing the obligations.
You can say, "We're going to change this law and we're going to allow this", but you can't say that we're going to pretend like nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act has pretty strict rules about how and what should be done formally, and that's right.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is disqualified for mere formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly walkable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow-covered.
They're mostly passable, but in some places more carefully.
The Karlovy Vary
This morning in Karlovy Vary the roads were passable, but some of them were frozen and snowed in.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but it should be warmer during the day.
Snow has stopped in the region, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, the Rude Mountains are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that in some places visibility was lower due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads in the region are currently accessible without restrictions.
However, caution is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be steep and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain routes, are passable.
But some of the ice is still frozen and snow has settled in places.
Especially careful is the road on high ground.
Pardubice and Kraľovegradé region
The Czech Highway Administration reports on its website that some roads in eastern Czechia are threatened by hail, and that snow may be falling on mountain roads and high-altitude roads.
Regional road workers warn drivers of the ice, which can form especially on the heights of the Pardubice region.
The glacier can be near Lanshcrown, Usti nad Orlicem, Polishki, Svitovi or Wysoke Mito especially on second and third class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads, located near Svitovi, are treated with chemicals.
Snow is particularly high on the Krkonoše and Orlic mountains.
The snow is deposited on the roads located on the hills in the districts of Rikhnov-nad-Knezhno and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic today, there is a change of weather, no rain.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
The Plzen region
The roads in the Plzeň region are clear this morning, but some places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, some places may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog in some places, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by the regional road workers.
The D5 is now almost unrestricted, but road officials recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In southern Plzeň and Tachov, there may be a few areas that are not covered.
Second and third class roads are wet, and there is also a warning about the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the less used roads in the Shumava area.
The Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the Olomouc region's highlands should be aware of the snowfall on the road today.
She was left after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk Saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsk Kršiž.
The snow forced the road workers to go outside at night, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperka.
In other areas, the roadside is generally unrestricted.
"On the heights of Schumperk lie the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Yesenik should keep in mind the presence of snow in the Chervenogorsk saddle", the dispatcher of the Shumperk road department told the Czech News Agency.
Their colleagues from Yesenica went to the cleaning of the roads at night, they assured that the roads on the hillsides after the treatment with chemicals were left bare and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are free, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forest areas where moisture is still present.
The Ustec region, the Liberec region
This morning, road workers in northern Bohemia report that there are still some difficult roads to cross.
According to the police database, besides several places with ice or snow, the mountain road is closed on the section from Telnice to Klinnice in the Ustech region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
No complications on the road have been reported.
Road workers report ice in the vicinity of the state.
According to meteorologists, the perfect conditions were created for its formation at night - rain and snow melted all day, and the sky cleared at night and frosts began.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the main highway and on the I/13 highway on the border of the Ustec and Liberec regions.
Due to the curved under the layer of snow branches of trees that touch the road itself, were forced to close the road in Telinitsa on Knihnica.
We want to have positive energy at our concerts.
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of many disturbing news stories that we humans are so easily caught up in.
The Tap Tap and I joke about this all the time, and we say that we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In fact, in December, you're going to do three absolutely unique concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell us more about that?
This is a national fundraiser that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which ends on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, December 20 at 21:00 there will be three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
It will end, roughly speaking, at the same time that the May calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
It was my idea, and then we all came up with it together with our artist, Gonzo Augusta.
Not only do we want to build up enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to work with the public to think about what kind of world we're going to leave to our children.
To mark the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of original shoes, T-shirts, handbags and keychains for the end of the world, which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed an anti-doomsday anthem called "The End of the World is Cancelled".
Will the already popular anthem be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it works out and the world doesn't end.
It's played by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be simultaneously broadcast live on Czech television.
The lyrics to this song were written and performed by Tomash Ganak, who also performs Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also collaborate with other figures of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We're trying to actively involve them in these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like working with us, they're interested.
What's the profit from the concert against the end of the world?
We're already in the sixth year of working with the Tap civic association at the Edlichka Institute to buy equipment for the STUDEO barrier-free education center.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Edlichki Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves don't have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them that opportunity.
As part of the Edlichki Institute's additional construction project, a separate building will be built in the future, which we will move into with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there will be performances by Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Irji Suki.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "great things" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
We would love to do a show next year at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the U.S., I would love to do a show in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans for abroad, you've already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How are you coping with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, and their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and tool boxes.
However, while we were doing this without any problems, Czech airlines ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Traveling abroad allows you to compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we witnessed that the East is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague, Moscow has many barriers, and it is still a bit of a freak to be able to move around in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
And it's not about the trivial things like giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to bring attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what is it that we have to keep up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind in terms of performance.
But it's important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to be able to move around on their own, to go to the toilet, to the museum, to go anywhere.
It's not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively participating in public life, which we with The Tap Tap are a little ahead of them!
Public respect or open-mindedness is one thing, but the moment we have a famous athlete, artist, actor, politician or lawyer, then everything really starts to change.
So far, these are rare cases of people with strong wills.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band now, but back in 1998, what made you start it?
I went to the Edlichki Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, I organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our host Lada Angelovich says, it got a little out of hand.
Has it only become popular in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It's true, we were helped by the fact that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the promotion of the band.
We've come to the conclusion that work that no one can evaluate is essentially non-existent.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you ever have a goal to get The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
There's a lot of things in show business that mimic each other.
It's logical, everything new is taken care of, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is pity, it's natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and abandoned individuals that we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that when people with disabilities do something, it's a shift, not just for them, but for society as a whole.
Did you succeed because you were the strict leader that many people think you are?
If we want to do our work well, we must be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend prep classes and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many were there in early 1998?
There's only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to stop.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - at the Fléda club and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a cable car at the moment of the performance of the song "The End of the World is Cancelled" by The Tap Tap.
The aim of the project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kronor for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Edlichka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert are 400 kroner, free for children under 12 years old.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of European Space Agency ministers, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and has taken an active part in a number of the agency's projects over the years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were doing space travel, but it wasn't always understood.
I'll remind you, for example, of the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Cosmology" at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.
The young engineer's ideas left the audience indifferent, and after several years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France, he won the Robert Esno-Petri and André Louis Hirsch prize for his "Introduction to Cosmology".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great proponent of astronomy and space exploration.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned proponent of space exploration, and his contributions were recognized in part by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway dredge equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as do the details of the project.
It's not even clear if the rocket was supposed to be used to drive the cart or to slow it down.
The only information about this dress is from the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The research was carried out by the Section of Weapons Technology in collaboration with professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzytsky.
The surviving materials show that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter-missile appeared in the specialized press, which was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, and the following year the work "Air-based torpedo-missile and aviation-bomb missile" by author Leliv-Kjivoblotsky was published.
Both projects were designed for military use with rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were handled by the Temporary Scientific-Consultative Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the work was stopped due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The society was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problems, which published four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotic proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in cosmonautics.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (POA) has been trying to join the International Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951), and in the autumn the POA became a full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the PPA, Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902-1959) became the deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PPA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile, capable of covering a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long, and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 two-stage RM-2 missiles were tested in the Bledovsk desert.
This missile was about 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already capable of doing real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could cover 14.5 km, and its task was to observe high winds.
But in 1962 further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 l, the Meteor-1B - 0.34 l, and the Meteor-1C - 0.62 l.
The maximum range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a launch weight of 380 kg, was capable of carrying a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to KOSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national KOSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repeal of the public works act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the public works law.
The ruling sparked a lively debate in the community.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
The significant difference in the cost of labour (wages) results in price tension.
This is the state in which a producer tries to compete economically by supplying a cheap commodity by "slashing" the competitor's price in order to take over a large part of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, or buying cheap abroad, or disappearing, and the result is higher unemployment in countries where labor costs are high compared to others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it has caused, the inevitable increase in government expenditure on social needs.
In general, the situation is exacerbated by the reluctance of businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and economic damage they inflict in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.
The unceremonious methods of private capital create at the level of individual states a situation where the governments of the countries are forced to compete with each other to artificially lower the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving their own population to private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected in the amendments to the existing legislation.
The goal is to economically force their people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to curtail workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
As a result, poverty levels are rising, and with it the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor who are unable to feed themselves by their own labor for several years.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are cases where people who are employed receive such a salary that the state has to pay them extra to ensure that they receive the minimum subsistence.
A similar scandal became public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are either forced to emigrate, as they were in the 19th century, or to live on a meager wage in the backyards of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But the question is, where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it won't come at all, because the Chinese, the Indian, the Brazilian, the Turkish, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African are still working for a share of the European wages.
This is true for all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are sick of saying that the state can't participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economy by regulatory action.
The next question is whether private capital, which now virtually controls politics and the entire state, is acting for its own selfish ends?
The answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in virtually every state.
As a result, we have a dead end, manifested in corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where virtually everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that government ministries, due to lack of funds, entrust the development of draft laws to private law firms, which are closely linked to industry.
The Bundestag then approves the bills.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution dictates, but from the financial-powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly finding itself in a situation described by Appian in The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long since disintegrated, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal graces with stones and swords.
"The people went to the polls with their votes sold in advance"... "...the common people did not run for the position of ruler at all, and finally one day the state was left without a consul for eight months"... "...they began to seriously talk about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the autocracy and the need to choose an energetic man"... Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it became Caesar, who finally changed democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, today's society is dominated by self-interest, without regard for the public interest.
Private capital is no longer meant to be used for public purposes.
The current result is no different from the past: an unprecedented decline of the elite without any attempt to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the rise of the fascist and communist regimes is that we have to look for the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
For now, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal type of democracy can be perceived as a definite pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, the tragedy is that the current elite completely ignores the impact of the hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity that we know from history, old and new.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition at both international and national and European levels, the Czech government will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
So this is a systemic trend.
The solution is to implement targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's share of the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in state governance, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The lab of chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence, and it never can". - Sting, "Fragile", where the main refrain is "Don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons had not wanted wars, they would not have been". - The dying Gutel Schnapper, wife of Meir Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, elicited a lot of responses.
Some support Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the state of Israel is racist, that the Palestinian Arabs are being genocided, and that the state of Israel is a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is the perpetrator and who is the victim in these recurring waves of murder, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation and did not witness the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95 years of tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reasoning is backed up by historical facts, some of it is derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people are the main drivers of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of power struggles.
In every age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What's not so clear is whether these people were always taking their own steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions toward pre-determined goals.
We must admit that we live in a period when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have happened in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families stands out one that could be considered as the head of the sprout (I don't know if someone stands above them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
They don't get much coverage.
I'm sure you do.
The first news agency they bought was back in the 90s of the 19th century to stop the rumors that their name was linked to the high-level criminal activities in the shadows of which they were, and which always led to their strengthening, their increasing wealth, or both.
They have large holdings in almost all the world's central banks, and they are waging or preparing a war against countries in whose central banks they do not have a stake (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took over the central bank of its country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the central bank status for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began issuing his own (get the government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy started issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for causing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of the three world wars plan, created by the great 33rd-level Mason Albert Pike.
The first war was to destroy the monarchical states of Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (this number of slaves would be enough to provide their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), create a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and finally seize absolute power.
The method by which the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, work is to call a crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the basis of the FED, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, the Central European power, Austria-Hungary, was broken up.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, which created a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it was only left to give the Germans a strong enough Leader, denouncing the guilty and offering simple solutions, then to create a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played the function of the fifth column, in igniting the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (a return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for mass Jewish immigration to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have happened on both sides.
World War II broke out, it's hard to assess whether Hitler broke free from the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or whether everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as Germany was provoked by the military reparations of World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create the epicenter of World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will be the victims of the fighting on the front lines, now along with the Arab or, more simply, Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only at home but also internationally (just take the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is to blame for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
It's important to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are pushing people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20% of all the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller, who said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept the new world order?"
The New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocrats who enjoy comfort.
A world where every newborn organism is implanted with a chip at birth, and becomes a fully controlled being.
"It makes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.
This calls for wisdom. Anyone who has insight can calculate the number of the beast.
For the number of the letter is a man's name, and the number of the letter is six hundred and sixty-six.
When the going gets tough, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student protesters seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the United States, which had been his regime's patron for decades.
The US administration could not have expected a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could have undermined the trust of allies in other countries.
However, she was unable to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran was largely responsible for the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of that story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees managed to escape.
After a difficult adventure, they ended up at the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by the extravagant cover story that they had travelled under Canadian passports as members of a film crew looking for a location in the country for a science fiction epic.
Mix of genres
The plan, devised by evacuation expert Tony Mendes, required Hollywood to cooperate.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the film's project, held press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special blend of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "cinema-opus", a story of a successful plot, a scam - an example of this is a series of films about the friends of Ousmane.
The film is constantly changing the mood - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the titles show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the lighter Hollywood scenes intersect with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other agencies -- men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of agencies, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has had a remarkable career reboot.
From a derided actor, he became a respected director, and his acting was no longer the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film by Affleck not to be shot in the director's hometown of Boston.
The atmosphere of the place is one of the qualities that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck demonstrates this in Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, when recreating real events - the opening scenes of the embassy fall are impressive in their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere suddenly history changes.
Afleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematographic significance.
He's pretty successful with this few, sometimes he thinks things up - it doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the runway chase looks pretty fancy).
The downside of Argo is the distraction associated with having to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as their Hollywood co-stars are really charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they're not the only ones in the movie.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, judging by the direction and retro style, recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hardly exciting.
However, this is enough to remind us of one still alive history in a sense, and to testify to how exaggerated the notion of omnipotence and omniscience is.
Rules of balloon, banana and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com portal, which annually conducts a survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd EU workshop resolution or project".
"We were inspired by the latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies", said Patrick Nager, the poll organizer, to Pravda.
Among the absurdities already nominated is the recent ruling by the European Court of Justice on the unification of the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had a preference for life insurance because they are objectively less at risk to the insurance companies.
"The next incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be submitted to the competition by the end of the year.
The vote itself will be held until the end of February 2013", Nager said.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory biofuel additions, which are harmful to the environment, a ban on reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, and a cage-size directive for chickens, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "butterbrush oil" or the removal from sale of classic light bulbs.
A good quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The European public apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of a particular trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now defends the demands of its banks even under threat of veto).
The lobby's interests are as follows: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union had to be 14 centimeters long and not show "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission has justified itself by saying that it is merely harmonizing existing divergent national rules that have complicated trade.
The EU has eased its standards on fruit and vegetables despite opposition from some countries, citing that existing directives would lead to wasteful consumption.
A candidate for the win in the survey could be last year's EU regulation, which requires balloons sold to be equipped with a warning that children under eight cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to US studies which show that balloons at play are a potential cause of death by suffocation in children.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14, who are not allowed to blow in the fairground's dumbbells.
Funny ideas come from home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is absurd enough: anyone holding any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the subject to Greece, use the name Macedonia, and must instead say "BURM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "Laissez Faire", has proposed for the vote, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the member state.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks that can be in the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the prescribed quantities of canned mushrooms, for which it faced a large fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for applying for subsidies.
But these ideas came from Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation", said the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas (PSDP), in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of so-called interventionary purchases, the state had full stocks of supplies that needed to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to Palas, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic to bid for grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy was offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Paul Nemetz (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to go to the subsidy application from Brussels.
EU: Fantastic orders are the exception
Although decisions in the Member States are easily criticized, the EU's efforts to regulate and to make the EU more efficient and develop are, in the opinion of many experts, more deserving of recognition.
The serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that have no hint of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which the member states have achieved in the budget debate.
It is also a matter of emotion among the Czechs that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this contest.
Although the Czechs retained the name "Olomoutsk cheese" after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, our producers had to rename "Tuzem rum", whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, "Tuzemak".
Only products made from cane distillate can be called rum, not sugar beet.
The official EU list of registered products includes, alongside the world-famous "feta" and "gorgonzola" cheeses, the German Lubek marzipan or Parma radish, for example, Karlovy Vary sausages, Gorzhelyetski and Trzebon carp and Jatec hops.
The EU also has trademarks for Pardubice pepper and Gorjice tubes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura claims.
Senator, what makes a man run for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If we had a smooth run of things in this country, I wouldn't be running for office.
But I can't stand to see the country being robbed over the last 20 years, the thieves running around, people getting their taxes and retirement age raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent, non-partisan person, I have no other way to make an impact other than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential palace.
Do you not turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying I'd join the presidential race depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool that I can use to implement my ideas.
So I need the most influence and the most authority.
But the problem is not just that we are a nation that is whining in our bars or watching TV, but we are willing to trample anyone who tries to change anything.
Added to this is the media, which vilifies people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was said to be a bribe-taker to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irza Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You started the fight for the presidential palace with a thesis about the financial and criminal liability of politicians and about the return of property declarations for the sum of more than twenty million.
To do that, we need to change the law.
You don't have that kind of power as president, and only the full Senate can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make tourism a free enterprise, it was pushed forward.
The problem with politics is that when someone comes up with a good proposal, left or right, they're deliberately getting in the way, and that's holding people back.
As an independent non-party person, I have much greater potential to win support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country, without party-wide shelving, without dogma-based review, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more right-wing or left-wing?
From the Czech point of view, I think people think I'm more of a leftist.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about one being right and one being left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it is proposed by the CCP or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for your company, you also have some ideal goals and visions.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You might call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working around the world, or are being talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll only have slogans.
And you're not going to last long in politics with that.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you'll be able to implement criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have any other choice.
Just to convince the politicians, the journalists and the public and try to get them on our side so we can get our way.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would address the chairmen of parliamentary parties, calling for the legalization of financial and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there's a strong person who can voice the abuse, then there's a lot of pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of public pressure.
I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to stand up for my beliefs and views.
I'm just a newbie in politics, and I'm going to try to get a majority for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own; in case I don't, I'll be out of business in six years and back in the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything alone, so I've sidestepped a number of prominent people in their bid for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused because of the volume of work.
I also at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenzova, who exposed the light fuel oil fraud.
I ran because people are really unhappy, but I feel like I'm on a scale.
Sixty percent of the people didn't vote, and most of those who did voted for establishment representatives.
We're the only two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate in a way that would make it difficult to make changes.
I'm still going to fight for my beliefs, like direct elections for mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to go through the cleanliness of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what about your own business?
His personal fortune is estimated at approximately $60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and several million more on the bill.
And by the way, I got the Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream, and I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, who was a gentleman with women, and at the same time, he fought against the mean and the lawless.
You're driving an Aston Martin, you own a $60 million estate, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
I'm supposed to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors indicates that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign costs are basically covered by my senate salary.
But I wouldn't be able to live on that money, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son for English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I was just trying to make money, I wouldn't be running for office.
So you're going to keep doing business for a living?
Didn't you say you were going to cut back on this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the amount of salary.
As I promised, I've partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the managing director of a travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a penniless man who would preserve the Republic.
But I need to make a living, too.
How much did you get as an entrepreneur every month?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, and I keep getting it.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.

MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not just in the imagination - with the example of Spikenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think it's a fun building, it looks futuristic, we finally have something interesting to see again", says Lisette Verhaig, walking along the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a large nearby company, says, "No, this building is really beautiful".
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everybody has the Internet, iPads and e-books.
Nobody volunteers to go to those old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
Spekennis, a small sleeping town outside Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven imaginary bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes in the form of picturesque painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the founders of the city realized that they had only one chance left to beat statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, took the task with his usual composure and appeared at the 2003 audition with five books under his nose and a smile on his face.
And while the jury members looked around in amazement and shook their shoulders, the bold Maas folded his original gift into a pyramid-sized pyramid and ended his speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
So here's my proposal: Book Mountain in the Spikenis, the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses totaling 50 flats.
In early November, the "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the competition "The Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national woodworking competition.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, whose white facades suggest a dairy, became richer by one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly, Spekenis has the first public cultural building in the history of this town.
It 's a long way to the book .
First impression: the Eldorado book under the cheese cap.
There is only one elevator that goes through the middle of the mountain range, so true architecture and reading enthusiasts will prefer to explore the area on foot.
The bright and easily visible glassed room, the burnt brick floors, and the elegant streetlights make for a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The eye is unwilling to look for benches, dogs, and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"The bookshelves are usually along the facades, and in the middle is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and faceless", says Vini Maas.
We've put the classic configuration of space upside down and pulled the reading zone from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountain is used skillfully: offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises are located in the center.
The black bookshelves are particularly appealing, as they are used as wall decoration, as parapets, and as staircases.
They are unusual in appearance, texture, and smell.
Even the most sophisticated architects and civil engineers are puzzled as to what this unknown material is.
"We have been working with secondary materials", explains Yop Trauborst, project manager representing the community of Spekenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And one day, on an agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we came across a suitable agricultural by-product.
For many years, millimeter-thick artificial fibers have been used as a root cover in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-saving.
Thin textiles last one or two seasons, then they're thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - the first of its kind - was pressed into panels four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, what is called land-based plastic (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, durable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like a sneaker.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Those who complete the nearly 500-meter-long trail will be rewarded at the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all, the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology", says Trowborst.
The heat of the earth is used to heat and cool it.
Although the Book Mountain is covered with a glass dome, even on clear days the sun only shines a short time.
The large, glued-wood farms perpendicular to the glass facade provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig has been here before.
And a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buckenberg "the Spykenisse soul that has long been missing".
The reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from his or her congregation.
These books were to fill the empty shelves of the library, which at that time had 70,000 books, and which was not yet fully completed.
It worked.
The shelves are on top.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that with our invitation, every resident is now connected to this new home in some way.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
So MVRDV has solved the royal challenge, which in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Spikenisse wrote his literary history.
And they're very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point for building identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained from the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefan Saba, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path by doing so.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why? Why?
Stefan Szabo: Germany does not support the Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel now.
But at the same time, I don't think she supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
NATO finally made this offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, it is moving from a policy that was, so to speak, led by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans lack a coherent policy.
So the Germans are again caught between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just beginning to feel their role, but they're on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy that France or Britain has.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German perspective?
It's a willingness to take a position in their national interest that is independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other major states, and Germany must therefore protect its own interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
So she needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in Arab countries.
Either way, it does play a role.
But I wouldn't put too much emphasis on it, it's not a completely one-way connection.
But in any case, it's a big part of the Germans' calculations.
Has Germany harmed its relationship with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I'm sure that in Europe and even in the US, there is a prevailing understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic a setback as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has been very clear about the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But given the local political situation, the government cannot, of course, openly take that position.
I believe that the significant differences in opinion are not at all as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is not at all happy with Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and its position as the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would have been a little easier for the Germans if there had been a single, uncontroversial European policy, but that's not the case now.
So they can't act within the larger framework and are forced to act instead, based on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in the development of a common European position.
It's not easy for Germany, at least not because of its ties with Israel.
That's always been a sticky subject.
But I think the Germans understand that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not take on a truly leading role?
Or is the lead still hard for Germany?
Germany is not yet used to this, it is still always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still always difficult to play a significant role.
Take the euro crisis, for example, and every time Germany takes on a major role, there are all kinds of anti-German sentiments.
The Germans can't handle this easily.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much worse position than the United States in this respect.
She has to take into account the different neighbors and opinions, which is not easy.
So, the US influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling that vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant or it makes you feel more unloved, that's life!

"Trademark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren is.
But what is an Armani Polo?
It's a completely official Chinese name, which has nothing to do with the companies that it's based on.
However, it will be protected until the original owners file a lawsuit.
But even then, it's not clear if they'll be able to defend their rights.
"Foreign trademark protection in China is becoming increasingly difficult", says Thomas Patloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, which specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new case of this kind comes up on my desk.
Imitators can only add a few letters to their trademark registration.
So Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as sports goods manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied in the same way.
Patloch opens a folder with the records of the trademark registry office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that also used the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The fact that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well known.
In large cities, there are department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeit goods.
But Patloch's case is not that, and he has been instructed by his trustees to oppose the idea of Chinese companies officially receiving from the Trademark Office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "ban min pai", the passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban dakwan".
That's what they call women who hunt rich men.
Chinese authorities have not admitted guilt
"It's damaging to business, and we need to fight it", Patloch said.
"The brand is being blurred, the unique position is being lost, the image is suffering greatly".
Financial losses and legal costs in affected industries are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copy products.
According to market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest-growing luxury market, with annual sales of 15 billion euros.
However, it is difficult and expensive to remove questionable trademark records.
The trial could take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court dismissed claims, as after a long time the contested name became "a reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist for damaging his trademark in China, Patloch says.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit against construction machinery maker Sany, which had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
So the Chinese still have the right to use a logo that looks like a Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo, Geely, initially used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had the famous crocodile looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be responsible.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of personnel and equipment in the premises.
But last year saw "a return from a work emergency to normalcy".
For example, the number of unresolved objections has decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
It 's costly to fight it .
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the ministry reports.
The same goes for the total number of valid trademarks, which is only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were paid.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs many times more to protest, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans succeeded in eliminating the illegal manufacture of their counterfeit automobile parts.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was a mistake of its own, since surnames are not protected in Germany, says Hannö Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark office has rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg won both subsequent instances, but the opposing side continues the fight to this day.
We need to be vigilant
The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a successful conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerves".
Internal costs are hardly accounting, the firm's archives have had to go through even records from a century ago to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side a "big six-figure sum in euros" for settlement.
"It's clear how much it costs us", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
That is, if the impersonators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The company has long since stopped production in these areas, but it has managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be on your guard", says Wentzler.
Both he and Patloch advise German companies to be very careful with China.
Rather than relying on international trademark protection regulations, foreigners should "register in China everything that is worth protecting in any way", Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it could be a lot more expensive than registering.
Indeed: if Freudenberg loses in the final act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party licensing fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in a contested segment.
World AIDS day: patting, singing and helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbonghi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are rejoicing.
The history of relationships that have covered more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, a search is made: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boots, and men's shoes pick up the pace on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers - the alto, the bass, the tenor, and the soprano - slowly build up and they step on, charm, and follow one another.
And Fite Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost pops out of his slippery shoes as he leads them with his flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbong choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty choir members, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from a geneticist to a janitor, came to rehearse.
"Om"Obani" is a difficult thing, each chorus voice has its own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to the United Nations AIDS Programme, Unaids, there are about 34 million people worldwide infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzjeni, Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them are in a school that prepares them for further education.
You can take over the chef's job for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongee is Zulu for storyteller or praiser.
They don't speak fluent Bantu in this room, but they can sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally even bringing them back to where they first appeared: southern Africa.
After all, some 8,733 miles [8,733 km] from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzjeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent infected .
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still living in simple huts made of clay and straw, and many of the residents are children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of HIV.
Essitjeni is a miniature reflection of the disease of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which has been shown to halve the risk of infection, is almost unpopular.
More than 40 percent of the population of Swaziland carries the immune deficiency virus, and deaths in the mid-forties are not uncommon.
The choir discovered this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, the Imbogny participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothes, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants to send their child to school for a few euros a year and give them the opportunity to receive a hot meal once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since been providing almost professional care for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs include HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Lumpy pediculosis and smallpox are parasitic STIs.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus.
We have a relatively low prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a lot of human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of cases change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are compulsory.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the incidence of syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than last year.
What are the symptoms of a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can include genital ulcers, urination, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or tightness.
However, they often go unnoticed without pain or other symptoms.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide complete protection.
Some of the pathogens that cause sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular screening, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and prevent long-term consequences.
The leadership, the donations and not least the fees for choir performances all over Germany allow something to be collected.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitzgen", says Annette Lennartz, the association's chairman.
In the village itself, the money is managed by Tsodwa Dlamini, a conscientious and active woman from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well-settled, for example, in the care of one of her grandmothers.
The Gogos, as Zulu old women are called, are the backbone of the village.
Some have taken in up to 14 orphans, providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that their children are in uniform and on time for school every day.
Those who are left without relatives are taken to the shelter by Hanisil, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and, in partnership with the U.S. health organization PSI, has organized HIV testing for many of the villagers.
It's hard to imagine, but a disease that's so obvious all over the country, they prefer to keep it deeply silent.
The King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it is related to sexuality".
Quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in recent years.
But it's also on the vagrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh".
To encourage a bit of cultural exchange, the Ibmogni choir travels to southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many in the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the Negro language - such a recognition not only brings good humor and joy, but even occasionally brings tears to the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Esitzgen, where the singers visit the children of the underchefs.
Although the small village is hard to find on a map, it is more than famous in the valley of the Eculveni River.
"Go to Esitzgen, there is light", the people there say.
And after the 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the singers are back in the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that light is burning here too.
NASA is discovering ice on Mercury .
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the presence of ice on Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered in ice.
It should be at least 30 centimeters thick, and possibly up to 20 meters.
Supposedly, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that hit Mercury.
No one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the probe's scientific director, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of the earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images back to Earth: little windows in infinite dales.
This image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition.
This fragment of the Spitzer infrared image is a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, the more difficult to identify in a star circle are pink "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region - scientists have erratically named it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This overheated heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-like ring is made of material that the star ejected during its dying process.
In the giant Triphid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
The NASA Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades constellation, also called the Seven Sisters, is visible to the naked eye at night.
Of course, with a telescope, the colors are better.
As the red eye blinks to the observer, the nebula of the Slip is in this infrared image.
It's located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity to the Earth's continents has earned this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides a striking color rendering.
This new star was photographed in all its beauty only with the help of the Spitzer telescope's infrared sensors.
Saturn and its rings: How they came to be is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's possible that these are fragments of Saturn's moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope: the Vortex galaxy
Depending on the color rendering, the images of spiral galaxies are transformed into real works of art.
A picture published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Triphid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, thousands of light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-sided, three-part), as dark stripes of dust divide the heated heart of the crib of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of Serpens, astronomers have captured a harbinger of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are drifting toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This is the birth of a star captured by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations might call it the Southern Chain Wheel.
A photograph taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This star nebula contains the brightest cluster of new stars in our Milky Way.
The crib is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, combined with the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
This bright galaxy with its little black hole has no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it formed shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippershei - before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become larger and larger - and the space they can see has become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror pictured here was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of one mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
However, it is about 11 meters in diameter.
The disadvantage of the inexpensive design is that the telescope is rigidly fixed at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its characteristic is its high light-collecting capacity.
Despite its relatively small diameter, it is comparable to the largest telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, anyone with a computer can help by contributing their computing power.
A view of the observatory of the European astronomical service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It says "Very Large Telescope" - which is exactly what it's called.
Its four mirrors allow you to see even the mid-infrared spectrum in your optic tube.
The European "Very Large Telescope" is also planned to be installed at the ESO Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to span 42 meters - and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, the two "Kek" telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors, each ten meters in diameter.
The Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks at the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope is to be built on Mauna Kea - a mirror with a diameter of 30 meters.
You can see them in the illustrations.
But the most important sights from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been delivering paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for planets beyond our solar system - primarily those that might support life.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been discovered since the mission began.
The photograph shows the final preparations for the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of a telescope is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger is orbiting closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar readings have been pointing to ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident of this.
Drink oil every day and live to 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are reaching the biblical age of respectability.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
A quest for a solution in a country where 97-year-old men still seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are reaching the biblical age of respectability.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
A quest for a solution in a country where 97-year-old men still seem relatively young.
A trip through the Talash mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus rolls along a twisted road, past dense forested hills, bustling hamlets, and simple peasant houses.
It's so green and bright, you'd think you were in the Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost tip of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Talishes live here, one of the Caucasus peoples, about whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and are long-lived.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town boasts of too heavy-duty Soviet-era architecture, which is not at all in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
The 200 miles (323 km) are eight hours, since the road is only one lane.
The legendary wealth the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is much to interest tourists in Lerica.
"In May, Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have the festival of the world's oldest people", says Fatulaeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a biography of about eight dozen talushas from these places, which is over 100 years old.
That's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136 , he had another child .
But the controversial star of the museum is the 168-year-old shepherd Shiraly Myslumov.
Birth certificate, however, is not.
And given that the oldest person whose age is documented is 122 years old, the age of Muslyumov is extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973", Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, had 23 children, and at the age of 136 allegedly had a daughter.
So did the shepherd of the Muslims add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Russia, has heard of long-lived animals in Central Asia.
"There are also a surprising number of elderly people in some parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and there are also an extraordinary number of very old people in Sardinia".
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, as there were no civil status registers.
A glass of melted butter every day .
Yet, the fact remains that people in the Lerik area are surprisingly likely to reach the biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over the age of 100.
Why are there so many long-livers in the South?
Farid Mugimzade, an Azerbaijani tour guide, explains this by the special genes of the talush.
The director of the Fatulayev Museum, on the other hand, believes it's about nutrition.
The Tallinn people love meat, bread, and most of all dairy products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet is healthy from a dietary point of view.
In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva.
At 97, she's still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, tirelessly rolling it back and forth.
Eight people live under one roof here, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, who have grandchildren.
There's two little kids jumping around.
The kitchen serves tea, which is served in typical puffed-up glasses of armour.
Mirzaeva has perfectly straight and strong white teeth, and under her headcloth she hides long dark-brown hair, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk so it never falls out and keeps the color.
"I never used shampoo", Mirzayeva says.
The monthly pension is enough for life .
She always ate only what grew in her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in a store in my life.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it got better when "dear father" Heydar Aliyev got behind the wheel.
Propaganda doesn't often come out of an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
However, there is no poverty among the elderly in Azerbaijan.
Mirzaev receives 230 manats (about the same amount of euros) every month as a pension, which is an amount that is good for local conditions.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's grown-up son is right: "The elderly in our culture are deeply respected".
They live in a big family, loved, cared for and happy.
What a reason to stay alive as long as possible .
The word "human rights" is not in the constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of the deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, met with fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president didn't buy the paphos.
We need to create a transition.
"And his success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, educated Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
Because all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily curtailed the constitutional court's jurisdiction and expanded its jurisdiction "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California in the United States, really wants to save is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be stripped of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged through in a 15-hour nighttime rush of obstacles at an Islamist-oriented constitutional assembly of 100 members, and this is partly cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the judicial process is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what do you mean by "principles"?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one may fear that Islamists will use vague wording and the legal loophole that arises in connection with it to interpret the Sharia more rigidly.
At least, this is what one new article suggests: in all cases concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country, enjoying great authority throughout Sunni Islam, should be brought to the council.
It shouldn't, but it could mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto have the effect of limiting the judicial power.
In the draft constitution , a lot of things are subject to interpretation .
Another problem is that the military court should still be able to prosecute civilians.
These courts were used to suppress the opposition during Mubarak's rule.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The draft also says the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morals and values".
Legally, it is so vague that government agencies can use this article to control even the content of movies and literature.
By open text, it means nothing more than censorship.
No article in the Constitution directly establishes equality between men and women.
The other prohibits insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The phrase "insulting people" is also questionable.
Will it be cartoons of the president or jokes about the legal scholar?
The question of interpretation, like much of this bill, which Morsi is proposing to sign and which, he said, will be submitted to Egyptians for a referendum "very soon".
"The revolution is back"
For weeks now, opposition has been forming against the Islamist supremacy.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unison on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El-Baradei, said the constitution was "in the dustbin of history".
Through a short-news service Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and tear him down", said opposition leader Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged", the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to observe the referendum, which would have made it invalid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
The demonstration was attended by a large number of women in veils and Salafists who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They demanded that Morsi "cleanse the country!" and assured them that "the Koran is our constitution".
The struggle for power over the symbolic square where it all began, provoked a state of virtually civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should go.
The majority is for the Islamist project, it's considered a done deal.
"The concept of 'human rights' is never mentioned"
Hafez Abu Saeed is furious at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOPR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because he believed human rights were indivisible.
For that he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
Now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of influence over all three branches of government is disappointing to the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the president de facto abolished it", says Saeeda.
Because without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels abandoned by everyone, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile directions with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a price to pay.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster that you cannot control".
Norwegian shrimp: the world's worst-smelling fish?
With a population of five million, Norway has one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the secret to this country's success be somehow connected to the local obsession with one extremely foul-smelling fish dish?
Have some more cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty, sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a delightful scent of rackfish, one of Norway's most famous delicacies.
I'm in a little town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but the air is full of an indestructible, characteristic smell.
A rackfish is a trout that is sprinkled with salt and wanders the water for up to a year, depending on what kind of shower it is.
As the sun sets and the weather cools, crowds of Norwegians gather at the festival in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this same, so to speak, fascinating dish.
"It is eaten raw and drunk with a syrup of aquatint, the local smoked vodka", explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter and "Rackfish General" who oversees the festival.
People all around us eat fish that has been cut into small cubes and then drink it with large portions of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquatints to crabfish", says Howard.
This drink is capable of breaking the odor.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can get a piece of sushi under your nose, it's not so bad - it's not much different from the sushi you've been carrying around on the bus for a long time.
The rackfish is a Norwegian product from a different time, a time of poverty, when, before refrigerators were invented, fish were soaked in sealed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then, in the depths of winter, when the fish had become well and thoroughly contaminated, they were extracted and, having been numbed by alcohol, were consumed as food.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated, mainly to the United States, is still remembered by the last generation.
Today, the population is growing rapidly, with over 13% of immigrants attracted by jobs, high wages, and a well-developed social security system.
People from Sweden (a long-time rival, and even more recently a much more affluent neighbor) are coming here in droves to work.
The rack is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, though somewhat ominous, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9.
Norway is rarely in the world news, and most people seem to be happy about it.
People here still reluctantly mention the name Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "July 22nd".
It is very hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway's prosperity today is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are thriving", says Anna, our waitress, who brings us a tray of worn-out crabfish, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic prosperity.
We are what you call a people of reason.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We don't like to show off, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when everyone was racking up money they didn't have, Norway was very careful about all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that's enough for happiness", says Anna.
"And there's the crabfish", she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food. I'm done with the crab fish.
This is a salmon burger, which is definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But tonight we're going to have even more of the same fish with a memorable smell.
My hotel hosts a special crab fish dinner, where visitors vote to choose the best, or perhaps the most fragrant, fish.
There's a live TV show showing the host in a butterfly tie surrounded by a plate of rackfish.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what's your rating on the best fish in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, this is our rating"...
Everyone's laughing and clapping.
Someone falls off a chair, possibly from over-watering.
Or maybe just by breathing in the smell of that fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is about to have a rough start.
As Mexico's newly elected president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's people.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly bad state right now.
The city is overcrowded at best, and steel barriers have been erected since Monday to cut off several key highways to the capital, causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, Mexico's new leader Enrique Pena Nieto will wear the presidential dress and assume the reins of government.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has enjoyed good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, who is now in office, but the country is mired in a war on drugs that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence", Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.
Before making such statements alongside the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto's political career was spent as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, the densely populated and vast state surrounding the nation's capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
A straight man .
In the idyllic town of Valliere de Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
The residents credit him with reviving tourism, developing the resort sector and creating infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are very different from the roads with ditches and holes that were previously on this site.
His name is displayed on the modern sports center and the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are hopeful of real and serious change", says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the institutionalized revolutionary party (PRI) led by Pena Nieto.
We expect real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed in our country, first and foremost in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous rule, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pena Nieto.
He also denies the accusations of incompetence that the opposition has leveled against the new president.
He's very forthright and very committed to his vision of the future of the country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nessaualkoiotl, also known as Ciudad-Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the paved streets of Val-de-Bravo.
Hidden beneath the highway ramps, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also the harsh nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were deployed to quell drug gangs in these areas, where violence against women is particularly acute.
In the last two years alone, dozens of dead women's bodies have been found in the desert near a vast landfill.
More than a thousand women were murdered in Mexico State during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto, far more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Pena Nieto's opponents, he was at best unable to deal with the problem of female murder during his tenure as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of ignoring the problem completely.
Resident of a concrete house, like most homes in this run-down neighborhood, Irina Buendia barely holds back her tears as she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her roommate.
"When I got to her house, it was as if her body had been washed before", recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of beatings, and the body was already decomposed.
Mariana tells the story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to a crucifix with just one word written on it: justice.
That is what they said was denied to this family.
"State officials treated me like an old gossip, a discontented troublemaker.
They want people to just take what they say for granted and keep quiet.
But that's not right, that's not right, especially when there's so much wrong and wrong around", she says.
By wearing the presidential dress on Saturday, President Pena Nieto will be taking on a difficult responsibility with her.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime over the past six years, and the new president has promised to make addressing this problem a priority during his tenure.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was governor", says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo for the PRI party.
But that's what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecution claims.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims of poor conditions in detention.
The hearing focused on Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is demanding that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions were harsh.
A U.S. Army private is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest classified material leak in U.S. history, failed to take advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint about the mistreatment he said he had endured while in military prison.
During cross-examination at a pretrial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein stated that records of Manning's weekly visits by prison officials during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defense's motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment was held the day after Manning stated that while in custody he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were later published online on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source was Manning.
During Friday's hearing, prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that were filed after Manning's visits by administration officials during his time in Quantico Prison, where he was in strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he judged the prison administration's treatment of him as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized".
The reports contain no complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being asked directly about the conditions of his detention, Fein claims.
Manning responded that he had expressed verbal concerns about these problems and that the administration representatives who visited him had discussed these problems with him and stated that they would address them, but had not recorded this in writing.
"They recorded 'no problems' (after my complaints were discussed), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in the conversation", says Manning.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of his mistreatment in January 2011 during a committee hearing on suicide intentions, which he had expressed in writing several months earlier.
Manning responded that during that hearing he wanted to have his "trauma prevention" regime lifted and his prison conditions relaxed.
Military officials explained that the restricted detention regime - a level lower than the suicide prevention surveillance regime - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I was fine, that they would cancel the injury warning regime... that my standard of living would improve, from my point of view", Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was arrested in Iraq and transferred to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Naval Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait, and that he had fainted one day in the heat.
He explained that it's very difficult psychologically when you're not told how your fate is decided, and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to the size of Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison", Manning said Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in this cage".
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - completely alone.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave behind a mattress, a blanket, a pair of slippers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime was forbidden by the rules.
Manning said that while he was sleeping, he was constantly struck by light from outside the chamber.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned in bed at night, he said he was woken up and made to turn his back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal objection to Manning's wrongful treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he made during testimony Thursday, that after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates at a morning check-in.
Manning said he couldn't cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
In response to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should drop the blanket he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one had specifically ordered him to drop it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could have used a rubber band or a strap to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, his slippers and his glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he has been through while in detention and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is scheduled to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense has said it plans to offer Manning a plea of guilty to lesser crimes and challenge other charges as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held at Quantico under the rules governing the detention of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
Manning is charged with aiding and abetting, unlawful facilitation of the Internet, transmission of information relating to national defense, and theft of government property or documents.
If convicted on all counts, he could face life in prison.
My national crisis is the story of a Mexican-American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country's difficult times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that Mexican-Americans are torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals corridor, approached the border control zone, and I stopped.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conventional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I stopped at the complicated construction of "Mexican American".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can't shake the American accent.
So I got my American passport and I got in line for the Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda for the meetings of these presidents was the usual issues: immigration, drugs and trafficking.
President Peña Nieto spoke eagerly about the rise of the Mexican economy, which would now allow Mexicans, with the same success, to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to make a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create some kind of North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old-fashioned matter.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and under the gunpowder of rifles forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think in centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
So, if any U.S. official speaks a word of criticism of Mexico, the press and the Mexican elite are immediately complaining that the Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montessori are filled with war.
But the most complicated is Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the hurt?
There's enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who don't.
There are so many people of Mexican descent in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio for one reason only: at some point in their family history, someone -- their father or grandfather -- didn't have the opportunity to make a living in Mexico and had to go north.
Mostly they were Mexicans of a certain type -- the dark-skinned, the low-educated, the poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
Mexico sees it differently.
Today, our lives are the American dream, we went to good schools and got good jobs, but we must not forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and vague, but we know what country to call our own.
The United States of America.
And we also know that most of the Mexican elite and ruling class don't like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class citizens, as not-true Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico aren't strong enough.
They think we're a failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain, finding a satisfying life in the United States but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there's some friction between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans -- Mexicans have a clearer sense of their national identity, and Mexican Americans are offended by that.
She's a U.S. citizen and she thinks she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of the Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the U.S., we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship is not already confused enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to be a kind of ambassador for Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country this is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It's not gonna work.
Too many grievances in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think this country is so great.
Sorry, but you're on your own, amigos.
And that's only fair.
If a section of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of what was done to their relatives in Mexico more recently.
I know.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for future peace
Is a lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
The sound of the senseless arguments over who started it is familiar; many buildings are in ruins; over 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of Israel's capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly locked in their age-old conflict, the Middle East is changing.
There are many ways to look at this, but the events of the "Arab Spring" have turned many established realities into a storm of rebellion, and Palestinians and Israelis have been unable to stay out of the vortex that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will be even more bloody than before.
But there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly stalemate.
A war without winners
At first glance, the situation does not seem to be optimistic.
Even if the ceasefire agreement signed on November 21 is upheld, the clashes this week have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, say they forced Israel to retreat despite the casualties they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group's leaders have been killed and 1.7 million people are trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled parts of the planet, Israel has failed to eliminate Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
The emerging regional leader Turkey, once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has come out in support of Hamas; it has been followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing states in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas's solemn supporters are declaring an Islamic crescent around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah group rules, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and on to Jordan, where the king's government threatens Hamas allies.
The most significant shift in the balance of power in the region occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood's influence was strengthened under President Mohamed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was ousted in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization much like Hamas, with their leaders more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic settings, Hamas could become a major player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the hardliners in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
Hamas was defeated militarily.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile system justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas missiles launched.
The citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the US has remained steadfast; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Although approximately 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by building a wall that encircles the West Bank - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - has joined forces with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a very comfortable position.
What's the point of helping the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If you give them all the power in the West Bank, won't they start firing missiles at Israel from there, like their brothers in Gaza?
Better to keep them behind the walls and stifle any attempt to raise their heads.
The hardliners may win, but their calculations may be disproved by the Arab Spring.
While the Islamists who are coming to power in Egypt and elsewhere have a rather lukewarm view of Israel, their priority will be domestic issues.
Israel's defense budget is bigger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Warfare with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, no less, must consider the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change in Arab countries unfolds, the deprivation of Palestinian self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the Arab population growth - is only exacerbating these problems.
The bloodshed that occurs every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas has been paid for with growing international discontent.
Both sides need outside impulse.
The only solution that remains is what the sane representatives on both sides, and much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are calling for: two states and the Israeli surrender of territory in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too great in the short term, that a ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long since decided to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, and Turkey and Qatar are more than ever in a position to persuade Hamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish state, agreed since 1967, with the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the virtual recognition of a Palestinian state.
President Obama must play his part in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
Now that he's back in the White House, he's still showing a reluctance to get involved in the solution.
That's a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible if there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, a uniform cigarette packaging law has been passed.
Warnings about smoking and images of diseased parts of the body are contrasted on dull green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first ever Australian law on the uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logo and colour scheme of different brands with the same dark olive-colored box with gruesome pictures of diseased body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different pictures and inscriptions warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packages, which has been mandatory since this Saturday, is the names of the stamps, which are printed in the same small type.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says that the goal of the measure is to keep young people from smoking by stripping the harmful habit of its fashion status.
The basis for this decision was the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 never became smokers in 99 out of 100 cases.
"It is clear that even at a very young age children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through the design of the packaging", explains Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, so these changes won't affect the profits of multinational corporations much, but other countries are already considering similar measures.
Tobacco industry officials strongly opposed the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase their share of the black market, where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences, different from those envisaged by its initiators", says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will be supplying much more of these goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws are a boon to business.
Sandra Ha of small family-owned Zico Import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette butts and silicone cases that hide unpleasant images on the packaging has grown rapidly (from almost zero) since companies like British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in Australia's High Court two months ago, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 products to wholesale businesses and is expecting a new batch.
It's a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the very segment of the population targeted by these measures.
After a series of laws in Australia made it illegal to advertise cigarettes on television and to support sports events, and to prohibit sellers from displaying cigarettes in public places, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from advertising online, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you sell tobacco products and you have only this one tiny loophole left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem very tempting", explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes a rise in brand reviews written by supposedly ordinary users on social media sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the work of a common man who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spent his time and effort making a video, or is it the work of a marketing company?
British American Tobacco's Australian division claims that the industry is more concerned with adapting to the new regulations than with advertising.
Tobacco industry officials have even sponsored Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules, which have filed complaints with the World Trade Organization that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that all of these countries have very little trade with Australia.
A decision by the WTO is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanie Plibersek, the government has been discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to mandate the posting of photos warning of the dangers of smoking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstrating defiance.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just take out a cigarette and put it in your pocket", explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that could make me quit is my little girl.
James Yu, the manager of King of the Pack, a tobacco store in downtown Sydney, says that the same packaging has made it difficult to get products on shelves
"It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, but now it takes me four hours", he complains.
"If the government had to take over and ban cigarettes altogether, we would have said, 'What are we going to do, it's over, we're closing the store,'" he says, raising his hands.
Boredom in a world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On Thanksgiving, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical problem and was replaced by the other plane we had been waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there's not much help here from books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, more scientists and child development specialists have spoken in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, for us and for our children, being bored is not so bad.
It forces the brain to focus on interesting, interrelated topics, which may help creativity.
And because we're all in front of screens all the time in the modern world, the benefits of boredom are missing.
Maybe we should strive for boredom?
- I know.
And at the same time, no.
We'll come back to that.
I used to think, like many people, that boredom was a relatively recent invention, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"Boredom actually has a very long history", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin inscriptions about boredom have been found dating back to the first century.
But the question remains, how do we understand boredom?
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an assistant professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that the understanding and perception of boredom has often changed.
After reviewing research on the subject and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: Boredom is when people "want to do something that would give them satisfaction but cannot".
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person does not do something he would like to do.
You don't want to do anything when you're apathetic.
The main cause of boredom, he says, is "attention disturbance and the associated mood swings and the feeling that time is running slowly".
The description of boredom can seem very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, whereas people experiencing depression see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when in fact we just can't concentrate.
In their study, "The Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boredom in Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recorded voice reading a journal.
Some participants also heard loud sounds from a non-relevant TV program in the next room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume so that they could hardly be distinguished, and a third group listened only to a voice recording without a third-party soundtrack.
Those who listened to the TV at a low volume reported being bored more often than others -- they had difficulty concentrating, but they didn't know why, and they attributed it to boredom.
When we try to concentrate on a difficult or exciting task, interruptions can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, assistant professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we are doing something uninteresting, "like looking at a flow of goods on a conveyor belt in search of marriage, distracting music can help us avoid boredom".
He goes on to say that when people start to swing on a chair or draw curls on a piece of paper, they're supposed to do it out of boredom, but now we know that actually doing these things is just to help you not relax physically.
"The study found that children who were not told to sit or roll learned better and remembered more than children who were told to sit or roll", says Professor Fenske.
At times, we all get bored: when a flight is delayed (as in my case), when we listen to a monotonous speech, when we watch a film that is not interesting.
However, different people display different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980's, researchers developed a "boredom-tendency scale" to measure such individual traits.
The scale is based on questions and statements such as, "A lot of the things I have to do are monotonous and monotonous", or, "I have too much to do, so I don't have time for anything".
Using questionnaires like these, researchers have found that boys are more likely to miss girls, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when faced with a variety of external stimuli.
However, teenagers in general often feel bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personality and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he paged nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
And what he found was that 32 percent of the teens said they were bored at school and doing their homework, and 23 percent said they were bored outside of school.
Only three percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what the data on boredom would be like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "the teenage years are the peak of boredom", largely because children and adolescents are not allowed to make full decisions about what they do.
So back to my original question: Is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, research shows, it can lead people to engage in absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or the abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have pondered the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has spent more than two decades studying the problem.
"This is how our brain tells us to do something else; this is boredom", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But that same brain doesn't always know what it's best to do.
If you get bored and you turn that energy into playing guitar or cooking, you're doing yourself a favor.
However, if you watch television, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop being bored, but he will not learn to cope with boredom on his own or to manage his time and schedule in any other way", says Professor Fenske.
"Such self-regulatory skills are used in a wide variety of situations", he says.
Your child is not only learning to do things for himself, but he is also learning self-control in general.
I don't think boredom should be glorified.
But it's not a bad thing either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of activities and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We see it as a need to get bored more often, when boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful", he says.
People actually want to get away from the constant worry and just relax.
"In the modern world we are used to constant over-stimulation of the senses", he says, "and when there is silence, we get lost and don't know what to do".
It 's unclear how the new marijuana legalization law will be enforced in Colorado .
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old soccer player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a crime that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of a small amount of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco says that one day in September, he and some friends were in Lamar and driving through the prairies near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was summoned to court for possession of narcotics and possession of a drug device - misdemeanors, each of which carries a $100 fine - and a hearing date was set.
"We are treated like criminals", says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been building for weeks after Colorado voted to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as on the venue.
Minor marijuana offenses are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 and older for possession of low doses, which will be considered legal once the law takes effect in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative Colorado counties, prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana cases and are still holding people accountable for possession of the drug.
Meanwhile, some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West are voting to ban the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores.
"It's all happening so fast that I don't even know what to expect", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The Washington State legislature is also puzzled.
They will have to establish rules for how to license the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most other states in regulating marijuana use, first for medical purposes, and now for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so they're going to be a good example", explains Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Board of Alcohol Control.
But right now, Mr. Smith admits, there's nothing more anyone can do than make suggestions and hope that it works.
"We don't have a real precedent to go by", he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will take effect on December 6th and will put the state in a state of uncertainty for a year, when the state licensing system is not yet in place and the right to possess marijuana is already legal.
And there are still some tricky technical aspects that need to be addressed during this time, like how to balance the state's mandate for "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on selling it within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses within cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs", explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently formed research group, the Center for Marijuana Legalization.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates emailed his subordinates that the city prosecutor's office would no longer hold individuals over the age of 21 accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police would stop charging people with these violations "as of this moment".
Police chief Oates said police will monitor the city's regulations governing the cultivation of medical marijuana and will pursue illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The Uld County Prosecutor in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is taking a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the bill was voted on, he said the prosecutor's office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, primarily to encourage users to undergo treatment.
Currently, 119 individuals are charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many are charged with other offenses.
"It is the duty of our institution to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time they are committed", Mr. Buck said in his statement.
Reaction was mixed even in places like Mesa Rural District, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecutes adults for possession of small amounts of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in the already open marijuana possession cases.
"I believe that it is our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes", he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the decision, it will not be easy to include recreational marijuana issues in the state and legal system.
And the mixed reactions from residents across the state have exposed the ambiguity of local authorities' attitude to the state's marijuana experiment.
"District prosecutors have a cultural barrier to this", explains Sean McAllister, a Denver-based lawyer representing marijuana convicts and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've been prosecuting people for this for so long that they can't really accept that it's not a crime anymore", he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana the same way as alcohol, are destined to become a nationwide testing ground for the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the legalized trade territory, but at the same time they are wary of instructions from federal authorities, who still plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of legalization hope the Justice Department will relent on the issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients, the federal government has mostly given the green light to the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores, which are allowed under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug counselor in the Obama administration.
Some towns in Colorado didn't wait for the federal government to act.
Even before the presidential election, some local governments approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores, which would not be able to open for more than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we're going to license somebody and then it's going to cause serious problems at the federal level", says City Councilman Bob Nicholson.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a discrepancy between the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was kicked out of Oxford because I was a Conservative.
The persecution of university students for their beliefs did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother went to Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium, which laid the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying history at Worcester College, Oxford University, in the late 1980s, I packed my bags and left, and that was the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't take it anymore and cried.
The friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from the broth cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or because I went to a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment, it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a conservative myself.
You're going to ask, why bring it up now?
According to recent reports, a new generation of students with center-right views is being subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of conservative students demanded the same protection for their rights as is afforded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, claim that they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwelcome guests" because of their political views.
They want to add an extra representative to the college's Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was compounded by a recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right", which portrayed conservatives as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, riding a Rolls Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver knob.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made "a scapegoat for higher tuition fees".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservative Association at Nottingham University, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing shift towards left-wing views in the university environment.
People who don't even know us think we're arrogant and rebellious kids of rich parents who get away with it".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who has been asked to step up protection, calls the atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of Oxford University's Conservative Association, says attitudes toward centre-right views have deteriorated significantly among members of the student club.
"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply the normal life of the club members", she says.
For the first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I entered in September 1986, a shy, shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish with hatred of the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of the reduction in budgetary allocations for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable in this atmosphere.
It was during the first few days of the freshman week, when students were getting to know each other and the faculty, that I first felt what was ahead of me.
I didn't know that teachers not only ignored the abuse of conservative students, but they also enjoyed participating in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization, and the government's refusal to impose sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - permeated the wooden walls of the auditoriums.
At my first seminar, I had to translate an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't ready for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt", said the professor, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph".
I had a hard time getting the lyrics, so I was recording them.
Harry Pitt was a very galling man with a face like a cake.
"Do not the Tatcherists learn French at all, or do they simply lack brains?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
I was in tears.
"I suggest you take a few initial French lessons in your spare time, if you're not too busy hanging out", Pitt hurried.
I came back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting at lunch alone, and then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a sophomore in the English department, who introduced himself as a member of the university's Conservative Association.
"I know who you are", he said in a friendly way.
- Unfortunately, here's the thing.
Anyone suspected of sympathy for the Conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most of the Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour".
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman in the Department of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who had studied at Eton himself, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious".
Other students picked up on his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" one of them asked.
- They're stabbing each other, aren't they?"
I felt as homosexuals must have felt before the abolition of the criminal law in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet like-minded people only under cover of night?
Will I have to become a Labourist and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only professor at my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He barely showed up in college.
He despised him for his provincialism, pettyness and adherence to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends in the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were accepted.
"But this is the best university in the world", he said, grumbling.
- They can't do that in the city of sleeping spires...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved impeccably".
His wet eyes were blurred.
"Do not make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it was just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out".
I was tired of constantly traveling to London and my emotional defenses were weakening.
My friend, also a conservative, was unable to resist the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week, during the seminar, when another history teacher called me "an enemy of the people", in all seriousness, I decided to do the same.
Burning with shame, I confessed that my parents had "brainwashed" me, and I called them "old fools".
The break was short.
The final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was destined to hit my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for Rupert Murdoch's publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't come out, and five minutes later, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and got on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a plax and a rag.
But at 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in school.
And it's even more sad that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the Valentino: The Sewing Master exhibition opening this week in London, ABC interviews Nathi Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentino: Master of Sewing, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il signor" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
The first hall of the exhibition, open until March 3, is filled with personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino portrays these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a modest tailor in the northern Italian town of Vogera to an idol of the international "elite".
There's nothing wrong with being in love with a royal court.
"At least they don't put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet, as some of the beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Tissene-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a great host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved coming to Gstaad in his shawl", explains the ex-wife of "Heine" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls the charismatic fashion designer.
We went to dinner at his house one day, after the fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 invited guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was evident in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decor, in its food, in its music.
"Valentino made each guest feel important and loved", recalls the "top model", whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Paris Fashion Week.
"He never goes out of style because his sketches are real works of art", she concludes.
The lineage parade
Garabani's life is not a story of obsession, but of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and high titles, and they like him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous, sixty-foot-long podium that offers a change of role: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade across the podium, gazing at the "spectators" from the gray that glitter with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume used by Monica Witti in "Nights", or the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farrah Diba.
Among the models in this audience are Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, and Sophia Habsburg.
Natti Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these clients say that their first Valentine's Day is like their first love, "unforgettable".
I remember him well.
These were pants, a shirt, a "vest" and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift he gave me", says Nathi Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty", adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they're so bright, and they're so "fitting" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Joampaola d'Arenberg also cannot forget the first time she dressed in a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of being old enough to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that hour came in the late '90s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear to a party at my cousin Prince Edward de Ligne's castle.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with a folding corsage and a cut without the braces.
"It was a dream come true", says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless", explains the Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from the fashion designer with "maximum caution... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the seamstress calls her dressmaker) to make this outfit of ivory-colored silk with pearl inlays, twelve different types of necklaces, and a four-and-a-half-meter [4.5 m] sleeve.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the foremost authority on the specialised press, the dress represents a milestone in late 20th-century high fashion, "the return of high-class clientele".
Deluded for years by the elite's "lifestyle", Valentino is now its best representative.
A Knight of the Grand Cross (the highest rank in Italy), a Knight of the Order of Merit, a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, and a recipient of the Legion of Honour, Garravani has collected as many honors as any of his client's spouses.
"I was always attracted by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and flawless appearance", recalls d'Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribbe, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time does not exist for him".
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest job in the world: the miners from Kavah-Ijgen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health to haul 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of a volcano along steep rocky trails
Some people find their job hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn a living by mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, located on the eastern island of Java, Indonesia.
Each day, Antho descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulfuric gas rising from the Earth's interior freezes in contact with the air.
He picks up huge pieces of sulfur, weighing up to 70 kilograms, and puts them in two bamboo baskets, puts them on his shoulders, and carries them up the steep, rocky road.
The summit of the 2,386-meter-high volcano is only 250 meters [2,500 feet] away, but it takes over 40 minutes for the weary loaders to climb up with a tortoise-like stride, struggling to balance and carefully navigating the path to avoid tripping over and falling off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Cauvaux-Igneux a few years ago.
The miners from Kavakh-Ijgen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur they extract
Once at the top, they make their way through the tourists, who photograph them as if they were monkeys from a circus, and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that the mining company has placed just above, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
This is Kandy Ngrimbie Pt., the company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, not to mention, its workers, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to petrochemical companies, since the mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Since the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees [$2,500] per move", explains Antô, who usually does three carries a day.
He spends three hours on each one and feels broken at the end, but they allow him to save 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort, it's three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage for miners is very high by local standards, with a daily coffee harvest of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) and an average monthly salary of two million rupees (167 euros)", explains a truck driver who used to work as a stonemason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not that heavy, but Antô returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason that in Indonesia is as crushing as the shit: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are only Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, coughing all the time, and his eyes are watering from the toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Antô spent three years risking his life in Kavakh-Ijgen, which had already started to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are watering from the toxic gases that the volcano is emitting.
It's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel janitor, but instead he is doing the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur keeps leaking at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Antô descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company has not mechanised sulphur mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they don't even get a cut of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photo fee, which, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance fee, the park guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This is a job for livestock, not people", says Badrusin, a 42-year-old hard-working porter who has spent three decades in Kavah-Ijgen since leaving college.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, he says he will endure the work "as long as he can", because he needs money for the education of his three children, ages 18 to 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here, because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns their throats and burns their eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that none of them complain of their severe illnesses... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain and ulcers on the shoulders that have deformed under the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unaynik can now lift only 50 kilograms at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his companions transport 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which they transport by three trucks to a warehouse in Tamansari, over a narrow 18-kilometer-long path through the bushes.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life", Unaynik says, opening his mouth wide, missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, is also a sulfur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates, from generation to generation, one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the work of the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing and education costs for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a patriot husband, you are my wife, a patriot wife, let's do our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of a mint cake commercial, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put bao in the oven" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that it will be able to use advertising to draw attention to this problem in a form of entertainment.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty".
This thing is exclusive to the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in the country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing our own kind, so we felt that was the topic we needed to address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, like launching pheromone spirits or throwing a quick-date party.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is to write a rap.
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage more babies.
The state's couples and parents' package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But it's all low-efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Administration, is now at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what's known as the replacement percentage - was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Marriage and Family Policy Division of the National Population Administration, says that the reason is "improved education" and "broader career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to postponing marriage and childbirth, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies that aim to dramatically increase immigration to counter the shrinking population are provoking indignation among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is a thinly disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and unwilling to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party scored its worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
The Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in birth rates has some impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care spending, and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to prevent so many small housing developments.
For example, it's starting to affect the real estate sector.
The city development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoebox", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46 square meter apartments are selling very well.
However, there is a view that they may promote a vacant lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yu-Sung, CEO of home-building firm EL Developers, says their "shoe boxes" sell out much faster than the more spacious ones.
They're more popular in the sense that they sell out in days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income is increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously hesitant to offer too many small apartments on a project.
Too stressed out .
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the centre, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive, and so is education, and that is why many people put it off", says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to manage my own money and time", says another 20-year-old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and housing and education costs as reasons for not having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word is left to Singaporeans when it comes to childbearing.
Offline personal - online personal
It's confidential.
According to the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, it is a property of private or "the sphere of private life that is entitled to be protected from any interference".
What is personal to a minor under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing situations online that he would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five teenagers between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very personal", in a personal sense, and "password and username", when applied to social media.
"I wouldn't post my biggest secrets", says 10-year-old Jorge, who has been using Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger for two years to explain the importance of privacy.
"It's a very secret thing, my mom may know it, but not the whole world", he claims.
I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games to FB.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or someone who was acting stupid", he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to post indecent photographs of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 of his FB friends and 9 of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are related.
The mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just uploading them", he adds.
"Social networking is a form of entertainment, and I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly", he says.
Without hesitation, he says that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
Wouldn't count on someone to recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and in the latter admits that he doesn't know the 20 people added to his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, like music", he points out.
According to the boy, no one had confided in him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they start pressuring me or demanding something from me, I just delete them", he admits.
Jose became an Ask follower after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy was no stranger to what is now known as cyber-mobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never knew who it was", he assures us.
The victim, according to Jose, didn't delete the account.
"Just turned on privacy".
Then it explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of people he knew in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cyberbullying", he confirms.
The key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and an expert in education and learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet was born as a means of finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a Yale University master of education and author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are them, the children and youth who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants, who have to teach them while we are still learning", she says.
She explains that this topic is difficult, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what they can or cannot distribute, publish or speak at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
"Also, they should be selective, whereas being popular, having thousands of friends, is what matters most to them, regardless of the consequences", she adds.
He says that the most effective way to teach children and teenagers about privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"It's useless to tell them not to do it", she adds.
Porras then lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or would you like to have a photo of you posted like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign pictures from a party, do you ask other people's permission to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at all times?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Offline, people behave with respect, responsibility, and other principles, and so should social media", she says.
The Watch
Eduardo Guardia, a university lecturer, elementary school professor, and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies conscientiously.
By understanding each of these points, they have a good basis for discussing with their children the prerequisites for opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published", he says.
According to Gaurdi, the key is to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers".
UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven binding participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Regular Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, however, sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the main page that it will be transmitted after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content was laid out by Peru's president, Olliante Umal, during a brief statement to the press.
Access to the Summit was always restricted.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "closed session, no sound".
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press secretaries of some UNASUR governments that were present at the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which provoked the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidential administration sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was a statement by Umala, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite press press pressures, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not circulated.
The official ASPA website verifies that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that all journalists had access to the media, but they limited the access to information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also ended with Chile and Peru jointly deciding to accept the Hague Court's verdict, which would settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Olliante Umala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins Monday in The Hague hearing the statements of both sides, as part of the indictment that Lima has brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and enforce a decision that clarifies the differences we are currently presenting to this international court", said Umala, standing next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, pacts and international tribunals", added Pinera, and greeted Umalu with a handshake on the background of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice came after Colombia this week protested the Bogota Pact, which recognized its compliance with the court's verdict following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR was suspended in 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollianta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit a little later in the afternoon, Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and 31 projects were approved among South American countries, the amount of the proposed investments amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements he mentioned were that UNASUR countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residency agreements".
He said that action was being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen uncertainty and organized transnational crime, action to increase access to medicines, affordable Internet access in all parts of South America and to address the risks of natural disasters in a collective and effective manner".
With Europe in crisis, "economic integration (of Latin America) should not be triumphant, but should serve to expand our manufacturing base and foresee a better future for our cities", added Umala.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes", the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are related to Peru, and are limited by transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-join the Union of South American Nations", from which she is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among neighbors was another topic emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before he began attending the regional meeting that he hopes to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico City on Saturday to negotiate in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogotá.
"After tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussions with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Also at the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are all members of UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland".
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which is approved by the UNASUR member countries.
"We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed his support for the revival of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition that the Anglo-Saxon states' influence be reduced and that the San Jose Human Rights Pact be taken into account.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret his decision, because he did not betray his principles, but he respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that at the time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to come to its territory for questioning regarding an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law itself considers it possible to do it via video conference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What really exists is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health by being confined in a small space without the possibility of exercising in the open air.
"It affects the health of any person", he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum issue granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a guarantee of inviolability that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and stressed that there were negotiations in London to find a solution to the issue of imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We don't negotiate human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is leading a number of trials in various European courts", he said.
And he expressed the opinion that "if Britain gives a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, this will be over".
And if Sweden, as it is perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow the problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to present himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediation, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt political villains, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this aspect, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists, "nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemon countries dominate Ecuador", and added that being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and supporting coups under the guise of legality", because in reality "it has destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "absolutely justified" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate now with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which was in favor of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not being followed.
This is a problem between the countries of South and Central America.
Conflict is inevitable, but it must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
We need to work through them together to get over them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a successful conclusion of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile, which is being tried in the same court, and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if the two countries commit to a decision, however difficult it may be".
Regarding the possibility of running for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he is looking at this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I've never been interested in power, but in situations of injustice like Ecuador, socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"It's a decision", he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment, which was already scheduled, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chavez's health is deteriorating", he explained.
The Ecuadorian head of state attended the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima today, which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Today 's AIDS deaths are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his test for AIDS had tested positive.
"I felt deaf", he recalls, "despite all the doctor's tact, that difficult moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to deal with his illness on his own, he wanted to learn as much as he could about it, and his efforts paid off - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after overcoming many obstacles.
He's been living with the human immunodeficiency virus for 22 years, and in the early '90s, it would have been hard to believe, because there were so few treatment options, so little knowledge about the disease, so much prejudice toward patients.
Even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him "because he had a cut".
In other words, having AIDS was a death sentence in those days.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without compromising quality of life.
However, many people still come, not knowing they have the disease, when the virus has already done damage, depleted their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the world's first reported cases of AIDS, "the greatest achievement so far is that the survival rate of patients who start treatment on time is exactly the same as the general population", said HCG's head of HIV, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of immune system damage patients have at the start of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4s, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4s are reported.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed HIV-positive at age 25, in these terms, "with control, can live comfortably until age 75", he explained.
To gauge this progress, remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico's case, the number of people dying from AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of UNAIDS), and it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been recorded as of May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how things are at our hospital.
We haven't had a shortage of medicines for at least the last 12 years, and the problem is that patients come in very late because they don't know they're infected, so they're in the late stages.
He quoted the devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come in with some opportunistic infection already; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to do early diagnosis, and therefore provide mass screening for all people who ask".
The proposal is shared by experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients like Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for testing, motivated only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die, I'd rather get a three-a-week blow job", they say, but not me.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To this day, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of things to do, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who are now afraid in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them know if they've been tested, if they've been at risk, if they're HIV positive as soon as possible, that's better, and if they've been diagnosed, let them know that they can live like everyone else, responsibly.
This is his message summarizing the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms are on the counter .
There is a huge gap between health programs and the average citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has covered the HIV problem.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this, "the prevalence of condoms has actually increased, we used to get one or two, now we get a hundred packs, and that's great, but it turns out there are still people who don't have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you need them?" is a popular question, with both jeering and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and health workers who don't want to hear from teenagers, the promoter assured.
I propose changing this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be behind the counter, but that there be hundreds in vending machines in public toilets in places that young people frequent.
It's not a promotion of promiscuity.
It's not about paying for beer and a motel, said Governor Emilio González when asked if condoms could be distributed under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already sexually active", he said.
Key data in the Jalisco
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) were recorded .
The state ranks fourth nationally in new and total AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
Ninety-two percent of infections are from the genital tract, six percent from the bloodstream, and two percent from the perinatal tract.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, because there are four to five people for every recorded case who are unaware of it.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals of a decision that overturns the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the survival procedures that are allowed by Mexican law are not valid in the land of the stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the approval of the June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of seizure of their property across the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door for a leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing three inconsistencies in the evidence.
As an introduction, while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern a competitive proceeding being heard in Mexico.
The first clause implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the UN Model Law on Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, designating the American Institute of Law as the arbitrator.
Second, the verdict establishes that without an inter-company vote, the debts recognised in the critical mass of the tendering proceedings which the Vitro subsidiaries had before the parent company would not have reached the majority necessary to approve the restructuring.
However, this is a possibility recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro wasn't the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Production.
It is also true that, subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the United States courts, namely hedge funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority anyway.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37.
That's the data the Court of Appeals is dropping.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the severe economic crisis that hit the United States, striking the country.
In the meantime, the Gonzales-Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenum, that is, the five judges, because only three voted.
If it fails, a petition for certiorari will be filed, which will require review by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worse, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae ("friend of the court") describing the process that Vitro follows under the Competition Act, signaling that it is exempting itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to bind it to Section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
In addition, the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
The two-sided puck: they hit the Vitro and hit the country.
The balance
Given the months of delayed complaints placed on the desk by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Pilots' Union Association of Airmen has already found a bottleneck.
The court headed by Carlos Diaz Chávez Morino has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory body systematically refused to provide reports to the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic regarding the operation performed by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the trust fund F/589 of the IXE bank, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be used to buy shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of Posadas Hotels.
They're surrounding the Dragon Mart.
Gathering at a forum at Caribbean University over the weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society have approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for the products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for the employees of 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that leveled parts of the protected areas and posed serious threats to the industry.
The death of ACTA
The government's denial of the Senate's request to explain the terms and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, has now been filed.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of considering it as a violation of free expression on social media.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, housing developer Homex is putting 500 million pesos of Exchange Certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with the offer of interest payments every 28 days.
Competival is coming out.
Formed by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, the Competival consortium has just launched, aiming to market software cluster services in Central and South America.
The investment in this area is over 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been involved with the sport for over 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few Puerto Ricans have as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before a brain hemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a minor leaguer, a Major League Baseball player, commissioner and executive of the BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I've played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation in the '90s", Reyes recalled during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia gathered during his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
He holds the most emotion for those who remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-'50s as a player to 1982, when it was 15 years since he was a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I've had the opportunity to be a part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
From that moment on, "Cuko" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the leader", Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was on his way here, and he was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and he said, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Do you want to?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartoff then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who became a naturalized citizen and one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincy brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy championship with Gauss, but I was already at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By then I'd preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minci's achievements in the national team.
I remember when we first won for the U.S. during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and it should have been bronze, if not for the Canadian referee who made us win the final game, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Cup team is the best team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one that won the 2004 Olympic Dream Team.
But my favorite was the one from the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won us bronze at the World Championships.
In that team not only played again Minsi, Gaussa, Ramona Rivas, Fico Lopez and 'Piculina' (Ortiz), but also young (Xavier) 'Tonito' Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who could not participate in 90 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but that brought us the gold medal and the great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With the likes of Canito Nieves, Pablo Alise and a young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players suspended for disorderly conduct at the Pan American Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performances at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has ever dominated at this level like Piculin did.
And that's not counting his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager?
That's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armando Torres.
From a young age, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you consider your greatest accomplishment in the Federation?
Participating in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in BSN there were up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I wanted to do, like regionalising smaller categories.
Like the Ponce boys playing only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Kids travel and play too much these days, and it's unnecessary.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for administrators, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Mostly I listen to music, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been there for me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died .
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series Dallas, in which he portrayed a principled, evil and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from his family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved most", his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving carnival.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died at a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original personality and lived a full life", Gray confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a liver transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman had gained television fame for his role as the decent guy in the light-hearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive young jinnie, played by Barbara Eden, and begins living with her under the same roof.
He was also the lead character in two comedies that rarely aired, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of the heap.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?" designed to create a buzz around the emotional episode in which Hagman's character was nearly killed, generated international discussion and millions of dollars risked at bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record-breaking audience at the time.
When the November 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million viewers watched it, making "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in history, after the finale of "MASH" in 1983, which drew 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others had reasons to attack him, too.
Hagman played Ewing as a greedy corrupt with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), put on treatment.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s gravestone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
That's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who were fortunate enough to know and love him.
The ten episodes of the new season of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The series has already completed five episodes of the second season and a sixth is in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have yet to comment on what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who had a string of hits in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatre scene in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met and married the young Swedish artist May Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his memoir, Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't include anything that I thought would hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an advocate for organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help patients who were experiencing fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and after", he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's going to be a little awkward for a short time, but you'll be fine".
He was also active in anti-smoking campaigns.
A course is beginning to explore the "End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
That semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharme decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible lure: the end of the "long countdown" to the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people seized as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what lay ahead for him in the next few months: the catastrophic Sandy hurricane, the financial crisis that some call "the long Armageddon", and the growing conflict that would engulf Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists believe the apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all", Sharme told students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If you look at what's happening in the world right now, as if we only had 30 days left, it's been a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with apocalyptic mindsets.
And he's not the only professor to offer a course on the end of the world this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, adjunct professor Barry Walker teaches a course on "Media, Culture, and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas spread over time", he said, and the way they suggest hypothetical scenarios that trigger certain human actions.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed apocalyptic-themed movies and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what was possible, probably, plausible, and impossible", Walker said.
On the main campus of Penn State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, have joined forces to teach a course simply called "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again in case the end of the world doesn't come", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students must study, prepare projects and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night when the world is supposed to end", Restall said.
The courses turned out to be quite popular.
"The seats were gone in two hours", Restall said of his high-performing course, which had 35 students enrolled.
We've been getting emails for weeks before the semester started from people asking if there are any more places.
Students, in turn, say that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridget Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the department of religion and sociology at Rutgers-Camden in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And the apocalyptic mindset, whether secular or religious, is simply a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that taught that", he said.
I like him.
But not one of the students interviewed - let alone the professor - said that he believed the world would end on December 21.
"Our first project was about a Mayan prophecy, and we kind of discredited it", said Julie Zeiglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"Other places people don't think about it", he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond when asked if he knew of any "end of the world" courses there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world", he wrote, alluding to the higher-level order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many doomsdays had been talked about for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and faculty are indifferent to this date.
Some said they were going to the end of the world party.
"Maybe I'll call some friends and have a laugh", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
