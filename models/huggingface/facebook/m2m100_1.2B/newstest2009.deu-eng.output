The Prague Stock Exchange is falling to a minus.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal day trading.
The Prague stock exchange closely linked to Monday’s crash at the start of Tuesday’s trading, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time it was the cause of the Wall Street collapse.
In the Czech Republic, too, the markets reacted to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Falling stocks in Asia
The stock markets in Asia experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Hong Kong stock exchange index lost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to offset part of the losses, thus reducing the drop to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell by 3.6 percent following the index there.
“The timing of the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong belongs to China, it determines its own monetary policy, thus independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass the draft for supporting the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the robbery.
A bloodshed of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which would cost up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Kčs).
Thus, lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodshed on Monday, and major stock indices recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by seven percent, the last time it had recorded a similar drop was in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not pass through the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress gives concessions: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a breakthrough in negotiations on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion ($12 trillion) financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final draft of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the US Congress on Monday.
This was stated by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, to Reuters.
In the Senate, according to various reports, the plan could probably be voted at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor in revitalizing the financial markets.
After that, however, there is a “indignation” due to the complicated mechanisms of helping the markets in practice.
The plan must be effective.
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our divergent views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to him, a final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawmakers met on Sunday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final shape.
It provides for the purchase of non-selling mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunges the financial firms into heavy losses and endangers the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan even further, but I think we are at our goal,” Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has also significantly impacted the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
It is aimed at reassuring investors against transactions in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congressional decision could affect Monday’s transactions.
However, it is not yet clear when both houses of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, and there is uncertainty as to whether the last-minute negotiations could not fail on a problem.
Legislators hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount allocated to support the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be allocated as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush positive on progress in negotiations
The President has a veto right, but Congress can veto it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining funding for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages, has remained.
“We have prepared everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s progress and “appreciates the bilateral efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Reduction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding benefits and a timetable for funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and to set up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards a deal that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects to provide assistance to homeowners who have trouble paying off their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the goal of reducing monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because you don’t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government will share the losses,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week, according to Marek, is not decisive.
“More importantly, congressmen agree to support the plan and pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there will be an adoption is the most important thing at this time," Marek stressed.
Duel on knife cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you in your choice.
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still make phone calls.
Therefore, of course, it seems that it is better to buy just one phone.
There are many reasons why you should choose an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owner.
Certainly it is hard to buy a great, expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is also no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you’re probably dreaming of at least one.
This is also the case with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music, in simple terms - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but also a Pink Floyd fan will hardly get headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also important.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do, they don’t even do implicitly.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, calling and simming, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, a worse camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill or take pictures of a TV.
However, the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to charge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, most of it is much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
This is why you should expect that the cheap phones will not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you still call the phone from time to time, buy a charger for the office for security – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good will keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one-time charging out.
Another problem is when you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly onto a storage medium, but few card readers do without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in phones.
For players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players set up a music library by themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre, or, for example, user ratings.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should ask in particular about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, also the comfort of operation.
If for you music is primarily background and you only listen to it for a short time every day, for example in the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Almost every cell phone can do this.
You also don’t have to control what music formats a phone or player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be just in that format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can in itself be a striking argument for why you should wear a music phone.
Unfortunately, the provider’s offer is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of sales of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people wear the cell phone with them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in your pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless free speaker device with you.
If not, you can resort to the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a very decent Walkman.
The biggest disadvantage for most will be that there are no normal headphones with them.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm aperture for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players, in turn, lies in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of features, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the disc player is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of a mistakenly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrifying bill for data transfers.
Which device should you use
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will be enough.
But attention though.
Basic models typically only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already own a phone and still want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then resort to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Belonging to the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the convenience of use is similar to that of a single MP3 player.
The most extensive is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) will afford you MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe it won’t wait long anymore.
That the Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often on Mobil.cz.
This, by the way, was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the recent steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, it is likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile operator, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a fight.
Per it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to cheat about the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
This is often attributed to Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, he would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market that brought with it a significant price reduction, to which then also the classic mobile providers had to react.
Even before the entry of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
You do not have to look for examples for long.
In February this year we about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the country’s fifth largest provider.
Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not require relatively high costs for building, operating andining a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less comprehensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-cliché target audience.
This service is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the provider of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could take place in the Czech Republic as in Poland.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance, say mobile providers
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobilking.
"While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look hopeful.
It is likely that Mobilking will enter the market in other countries in our region,” says Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
She indirectly confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
GTS Novera Group has long demonstrated its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator, which aims to take another step towards becoming a real competitor to Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Non-official information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
Until now, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
“At the moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has significant differences compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area,” said Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds, in rare accord with O2’s statement: “So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on.”
And she adds: "There will hardly be a single virtual provider on T-Mobile's network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete offer in place to be able to think so short-term.”
Vodafone is focusing more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities – hand in hand with providers
The behavior of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also a decrease in profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
That the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something, also proves the long way around the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came from the company T-Mobile at the time U:fon came on the market.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
U:fon is a good argument for why you shouldn’t allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment in the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would put high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services.”
However, given this approach by the mobile operators, it is surprising that the Czech regulatory authorities are completely disinterested.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which in the Czech Republic unfortunately – unlike the UK and other highly developed countries – does not have the competence to interfere in economic competition.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to his very typical attitude to this whole problem.
The entry of a virtual mobile operator into the market would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the traditional providers,” said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of Foreign Relations of the ÚOHS in his response to our request.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
From an authority that represents consumer interests and is intended, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position in the market, this is more than worrying.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: “In foreign countries, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services.”
Probably, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not in the interests of the ÚOHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile providers resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the exact same price of gasoline at the gas stations is surely just a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
The Authority has not found any signs of anti-competitive action in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market to virtual providers are likely to be lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view – for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has, logically, the monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
But even if you do not follow this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting strikingly similarly.
Complaints from a number of stakeholders (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles in negotiating with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to enforce the extension of the competences of the ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications in the recently adopted novel of the Telecommunications Act, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It happens when no one looks.
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, is not taken into account.
These are companies that issue their own pricing lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
These are usually companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected people.
The joke of the thing is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer ordering a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile providers prohibit similar type of resale.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual terms, which we will then deal with, which can lead to the termination of cooperation with the corresponding company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that such a thing will not happen with the responsibility of the mobile providers.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such action.
In fact, these companies do not generate negligible profits from their activities, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points to possible problems: “The law allows for such kinds of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not running on their name, so they can’t have it as fully as the normal customers of the mobile operators.”
That alone, however, should at least seem strange to the ČTÚ.
Also, another question opens up for the UOHS.
When mobile providers close their eyes to such actions, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy itself with the declaration of the providers that they would know nothing about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers led to a significant decline in the prices of the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence.
The arguments they used were virtually identical – a too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, it was at these moments that regulators intervened, trying not to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in competencies in these cases is more than favourable.
But let us not throw the flies into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may soon be moving again.
If a provider permits the emergence of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And then the Czechs will finally not pay more than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my homeland.
The hymn was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir and in an instrumental version.
The song was composed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech National Anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier, he told the Czech broadcaster that he has selected singers with young, representative voices that are prominent and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that there is harmony," said the conductor.
The Czech National Anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first sounded on the stage of the Ständetheater in 1834 in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strip of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the “new” hymn sound?
The Prague transport companies will be transporting on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague transport operations as a date when the first passengers board a subway, tram or bus carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the same time at the information centers and branches of the transport operators at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon.
Those who use internet sales can really forget the output window in the metro stations, where they had to regularly wait in long queues for their paper carts.
You buy the coupon via the Internet and play it on the Opencard at one of the 13 branches of the city library.
“At these points, travellers also have a switch with trained staff who advises interested parties on online shopping and also plays the coupon on the card,” said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on self-service machines on the opencard, which are mounted in some subway vestibules.
How do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket designers, the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"At the moment there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there are eighty," Opatrný adds.
The coupon is controlled by an automaton instead of the driver
Operating the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is enter the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play off on its own.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mostly the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have readers that allow them to check the validity period of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization's ticket control.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver’s box.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked place on the side of the box.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel with suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon expires can, in turn, go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here, the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
Sudans Call for U.S. Referendum
In 1945, the Sudet Germans requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is stated in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans appealed to the President of the United States.
This is evidenced, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter says, which is signed with the words “people who care about the fate of the Sudets.”
As the annexation of Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans, aware of the Czech national character, to suspect that they would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the patronage of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the views of a quarter-million inhabitants of this territory, you are speaking to a state foreign to us, which has sought to oppress and eliminate minorities and has not contributed at all to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors can’t sign is supposedly the fear of revenge cravings of the “Czech oppressors.”
If the U.S. President had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemians, it would be sufficient for him to initiate a referendum in Bohemians about whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the protectionism of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, however, according to some contemporary witnesses, it draws a good picture with regard to the expectations of the Sudet Germans at the time.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that their deportation from the republic would be negotiated, few of them realized such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others thought they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
During the war he served as a Budweiser German in the Baltic Sea Navy.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would be happy with the Czech language," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected, in his opinion, that he would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
If you don’t think, then pay.
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This could also be characterized by the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to deter drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to prevent drivers from driving too fast and from drinking alcohol.
Remember to take care of yourself before traveling.
The campaign is aimed primarily at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is evidenced by the “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don’t think, then pay.
The words “don’t think” are written in large letters on an identification sign.
And in a blood plaque there is the word “pay”.
This means that one can pay a moment of inattention with one’s own life.
The spots will shock viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see pictures of drastic images of accident victims.
It promises that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Cake and sugar for drivers
“For drivers, the motto is sugar bread and sting.
Sugar bread means that when you drive on red, for example, you save time.
The punishment is the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And therefore, information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist thinks.
Even less effective, in his opinion, are boards that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static dashboard that warns of a danger, it will probably soon disappear with the surroundings, and drivers will no longer notice it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of practically all of the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He said this in an interview published on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to assign a similarly high percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a portion of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in the city in July, which killed several people and wounded dozens of people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Berne and sacred and historical sites" located on the territory of the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he continued.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights,” Olmert said.
“The Syrians know too well what they have to give up in order to regain the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up their constant support to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.”
Questions after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to run around
In connection with the tragic accident of a student agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to run in and out of the bus while traveling.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward would be contrary to the road traffic law," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the truck driver who crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting at that moment to all disaster next to the driver, in the least secure seat in the car, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply when the steward is drawing coffee or newspapers.
It also matters whether the bus is also equipped with standing seats according to the car letter.
If this is not provided in the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency buses have no seats, as confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this initially did not agree to the movement of travellers.
Later, this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that passengers were allowed to go to the toilet while on the way, if they have their seat," he said.
The law knows no steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward – no legislation describes that role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of vehicle companion, but it does not define his rights and duties," the ministry spokesman Hanzelka clearly adds.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem in a subsequent manner.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product license also has standing seats.
That is all,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, public transport buses with parking spaces and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in a plane, says the expert
The BESIP specialist in traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín sees the movement of stewards on board a bus as no fundamental problem.
"With a smooth way of driving, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an airplane.
Even here, it’s not sure when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can stumble her head.”
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this problem is not fully solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this role.
The director does not consider his job to be risky even after the accident.
But as soon as I get the impression that the steward’s profession is risky, I’ll remove him.
Coffee and newspapers can be received on board.
This would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in security, Asiana Director Alexei Litvin justifies the lack of stewards in his bus, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have a stewardess, but we have been fighting against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end with some fatal accident,” he told Týden.cz a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the region of Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck probably turned away from the bar without blinking and blocked the bus from driving.
The driver of the bus tried to evade through a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right front with the truck.
That the two seats were sold for the stewards, Jančura denies.
"These seats cannot be reserved on remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A legislative change?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transportation has been working for over a year.
"H, no concrete conclusion has yet been reached.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving,” says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and occupational health authorities.
Dusseldorf’s hopes rest in Frankfurt
In general, it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB Board to the staff of the House.
A merger of units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", the letter said.
The WestLB introduced a “competence block” with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further alliances in the state banking sector.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in a difficult time.
The WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which has only recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia state government, the time is pressing to find a future solution.
As usual, a connection between the Deka-Bank, which is known to savings fund customers for its investment funds, and the WestLB has been discussed for some time, including on the Frankfurt side.
Although the head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, in the presentation of the semi-annual figures at the end of August, said that in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, which is carried out in half by the state banks and the savings associations, has commissioned the board of directors to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or part of it.
The negotiations have, of course, just begun, according to the financial square.
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in Frankfurt, is not the first to be discussed when it comes to consolidation in the savings banking sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
Nothing came out of this triangle.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse state government opposed Helaba’s involvement.
The other two houses did not find each other.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been games of thought about the connection of the Deka-Bank with state banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board, spoke against plannings about joining with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to mature that a collapse of the various houses of the public sector does not.
Now that the Bavarian parliamentary elections are over, a connection between the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could come closer.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure to further mergers increases, the partners will gradually start to do so.
In the south, it would be only a junior partner, although it has so far survived the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A joint venture with the West LB, in turn, has pushed the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkassen and Giroverband, which has an 85 percent stake in the Helaba, a bargain earlier this year.
It is the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question, which business model should ensure the future capability of the state banks, has not been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband so far.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the board of directors there is also the mention that there is definitely a "comprehensive solution" for the house.
How this can be combined with the merger of individual units with the Deca-Bank will still be shown.
The second wheat weekend is known as the “Italian weekend”.
It’s the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively constructed barter and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travellers the deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a knock, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova train station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", are scheduled to arrive at 6:30 p.m. this evening.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, one bus travels exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that’s not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat of pelchemite food and glasses with wide silver beams, belongs to the buses.
They have been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
Back in the evening, back in the daytime at 22.30.
Accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian Purity Covenant, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the motorway in the direction of "Brennero".
There is no beer yet.
It quickly becomes quiet on the bus, the passengers sleep.
You will still need your strength.
It will stop in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where a number of other buses with Italian markings also take a break on Highway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at half seven in the morning on the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, “When the doors open to the bear farm, it means to run!” says Marco in the morning.
Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The measure, Marco cries, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget drinking money.
"We show the security personnel that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!”
Thirdly, “Tonight point half eleven here again!”
Now we are going to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
They want to be armed for withdrawal.
It is the second wheat weekend, known as the “Italian weekend”.
There are no precise figures; it is said that 50,000 are on their way across the Alps and fall into the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived this weekend extra from Italy.
Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts a national statistics in which the Italians take the first place ahead of the British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical care.
Particularly popular with Italians is the courtyard.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, German finance minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also insists that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis developments.
It has already arrived on the weekend.
Munich-listed real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate will only have to pay interest on the part it uses.
The money comes from both public and private banks.
This is due to the loss of his daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced himself extremely short-term for long-term projects for which he has borrowed money - which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also slightly decreased from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current revenue and net revenue from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, revenue from liabilities and certain securities as well as the dissolution of liabilities in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursements of subsequent settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regulations and from the provision of business for group companies, the revenue minus was still moderate, at around 16 percent.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Because the classical government funding earned too little, Depfa had then increasingly engaged in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public-partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate will now have to make depreciations, which will have a "significant material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, that is, quite indefinitely.
The fact is that the dividend has been canceled.
In 2007, it was reduced by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major government and infrastructure financier since Depfa’s acquisition.
It is more dependent on interbank refinancing than other institutions because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely dropped, as banks are holding off their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds to refinance a portion of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around €50 billion – annually.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable time and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely functioning international money markets”.
Other sources say that the funds will guarantee refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable time.
Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) believe that the market capability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that the funding does not need to be fully utilized.
The opposite is also not to be discarded.
Since the bank was still ahead of bankruptcy late Sunday evening, even the rescue, at least temporarily, cannot calm the minds.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond prices are very good.
When currencies show that the primary debt is barely moving, the rates of the subordinate bonds show more clearly.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturity periods beyond 2009 are affected.
If hypo-real-estate bonds used to appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had just taken over the crisis with the acquisition of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, we can assume a timely withdrawal of pensions.
Or it is happening what hardly anyone is currently hoping – that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports overwhelming with partial nationalization, the probability bordering on security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is likely to provide long-term creditors with some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a closing line anyway to form a loss statement for future deductible tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to sneeze: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does this mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
My first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Before school, I had Bammel.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of classes in Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly regulated as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students get into trouble from eight o’clock until twenty before nine a short round of meeting with the teacher begins, the ‘home room’.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to speak in front of people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I wore an old coat of my hostess, plus a blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in that elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were all ticking, cuddling, and cuddling, and constantly I heard the word “Kawaii.”
I knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means ‘good, sweet’.
I quickly got into my place.
The girl next to me cried pretty wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but as the gong sounded, I was really overwhelmed.
Everyone spoke confusedly and cried and asked for holes in my stomach - it was really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all picked out their bentos.
My hostess had also made me such a lunch box - this is something different than the dirty German bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is true that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums maybe, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made bento, which she then makes especially artistically - hoping to get to know the boy more closely at the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can see this here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I have been reading my favorite manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started to learn a bit of Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that at some point I had to go here.
I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
We place great value on them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends – on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
If a rat or a frog escapes in danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have emotions.
Just how can we check if they feel the same when they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has published contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove this so far where we can not even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut off issues of sensation or consciousness in general, we enter unmovable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it stands dead, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, which some scientists conclude with a comparable subjective experience.
I do not believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This wide region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So at least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that humans are even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is associated with speech, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how composed it may be, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor analyzed, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, then its research poses us great problems.
Most of my arguments relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that is more scientifically accessible.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of primate short-term memory, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What happens to the sensations?
I bring them back to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in one of its own activity-conscious brains.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) demonstrates working memory.
Thus, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and in particular humans.
In conjunction with the linguistic nature, there are fine grades of sensation, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body sensory regions of the cortex and brain stem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network hasn’t changed much in the course of human evolution, it might well be involved in cross-genre sensations.
Theoretically, I cannot contradict this, but I find it unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels like it in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
Does a cow run away in danger if she feels afraid too?
In my view, mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove experiential equality.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, frogs do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how could you prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even frogs (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don’t know how to prove that.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I’d rather explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the neural level here, as long as the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I do not study language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You may think it’s short-sighted, but I’d rather move forward than constantly run against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be put under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the Euro together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
The number of EM stages may even be reduced from eight to six.
“We cannot waste time anymore.
We must now work at the highest speed,” said the Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA will keep us on track.”
An even more radical move was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The meeting was held at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the Euro 2012 will not suffer from this.”
Several first-tier players had been sentenced to compulsory descent only last season for manipulation, after all, even the league start had to be postponed for a short time.
Dennis Quaid is back.
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outete her flogged Dennis Quaid as an adulteress.
He swallows - and beats back.
Late Rose War with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant quarrel with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The scale of the fraud was only discovered after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “Monstrously,” the 54-year-old told the “New York Daily News,” “Meg repeatedly jealousy the history of our relationship.”
It is also "unfortunate" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and turmoil that means a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is re-married and has recently become the father of twins.
And so his introductions end with the sidewriting: "My life goes on anyway.
I feel lucky to have a wonderful family that goes well.”
Flights and hotels prices drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights have become up to 50% cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and observed a marked drop in the second quarter following a price rise in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, overnight stays in many places have already increased.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
Between April and June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is American Express’ weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a “diminishing travel desire of American tourists.”
Financial locations such as Frankfurt and London are also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with a 26.3 percent rise.
Also in flight prices, the trend showed up in the first quarter:
Economy-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, due to the petroleum-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
Between April and June, prices for Economy Class tickets dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in Business and First Class were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the fall in prices is on the one hand the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand is falling in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, increases competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the cancellation of unprofitable routes by Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – in Europe alone this was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein to expand break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lever to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it went over his lips convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were sitting back on their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some fuzzy actors.
His request was heard in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg coach Martin Jol.
His command will sound like this: here with two doors!
The implementation remained.
“It wasn’t all nice to watch today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted to be more relaxed.
The 1:0 (1:0) was due to the headball hit by Mladen Petric (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flashboard on the video wall, which marked their club as class primacy.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to classify that,” Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate is more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late entrances - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen removed from FC Bayern - is slow, but can not shine yet.
“We need more flair and more dribbling,” Jol said.
After the vote defeat
Wall Street is scared.
The first news of the failure of the bailout package temporarily caused the Dow Jones to fall by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow got something again.
At 20:30 a.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer scored a drop of more than five percent at 10,579 counters.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down by more than seven percent at 1,458 points.
The biggest losers at the time were the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No title could be won.
Goldman Sachs’ shares fell by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, investor Warren Buffett had invested in the company.
As part of the bailout plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called faulty mortgages.
However, the amount should not be paid in one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock options notes from financial companies that could be redeemed if the price develops accordingly in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the U.S. slide down
The billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the US do not resolve the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and breaking down the Dax.
The U.S. Dow Jones index loses despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have crushed the German stock index (Dax) deeply into the bottom.
Despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, the stock of the Munich real estate funding company temporarily lost three-quarters of its value, which Commerzbank dropped by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded a 3.7 percent drop at 5,839 points.
Globally, the stock markets are on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to boost the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points in the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially fell by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slid by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75.

Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight of spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion in research: Dark matter affects the speed of spacecraft during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to the freezing of fuel pipes, you are now in danger of a cold death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among scientists - the swing-by-anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight manoeuvre by spacecraft, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American spacecraft Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has surprised researchers for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100% as one would expect according to the ancient law of gravity.
There are irregularities in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called it swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have invented in the universe.
“The anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It is obviously a force of attraction which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes up about a fifth of the mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists released in Egypt
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt are to be released again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans are often targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports on Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are safe and safe, Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the hijackers were prepared to end the abduction before the Sudanese army suddenly killed six of the hijackers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was "only about taking the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the hijackers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court has.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Mrs. Randle committed suicide in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had her bound and her eyes bound before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who worked a large part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was prosecuted for abuse, which had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead” since 2006 and had “abandoned her life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather writing a confession letter that ended, “I used to tie her and connect her eyes.”
“I didn’t force you sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim’s suicide.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: “I take note of what impact, according to the description of Stephanies father and mother, her act had on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was sent by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said: “They thought it would be dealt with internally with the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet.”
The employee whose name cannot be named is charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause that deals with the secure storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he carried out included classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret place.
Housing companies look at B&B costs
British housing companies could face costs of more than £80 million after rescuing the Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government allocated £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that companies and their members would have to pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid once Bradford & Bingley’s loans are settled.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged to those 700 financial companies that accept deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies are included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted cautiously ... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to raise £81 million for interest rates for the first year.
Adrian Coles, the general director of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously during the real estate boom are now called to bear some of the costs by those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records existed in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the coming weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are non-partisan bilateral organizations, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm were conducted.
Retailers should decide whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Former prime minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said the court refused bail regarding the allegation of blackmailing 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released earlier this month against bail.
Sheik Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, has called for the military-backed transitional government to grant her first full freedom.
The correspondents say that although her weekly suspension was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to continue on her feet if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheik Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted a bail as she is already under detention abroad in order to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a legal appeal against the Supreme Court.”
Her lawyers say she needs a deposit to return from abroad to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheik Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
The Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations launched a vaccine program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s pledge not to attack or hinder the thousands of workers carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Court of Appeal on Competition has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission had argued that the share of BskyBs distorts competition and allows it to unfairly influence the broadcaster ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority that BskyB’s purchase of the stake in ITV raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office of Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, because BskyB had announced its intention to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to investigate the dismissal of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy will now clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to hinder justice.
Serious allegations including criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be fired due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to consider the dismissals politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in prosecuting senior Republican congressmen, while others refused to investigate Democratic allegations of electoral fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting legal cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been bombarded because of the dismissals and has ultimately resigned.
Several officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The inspector-general’s report, in particular, criticized Gonzales’ role by bearing “the main responsibility” for the redundancies, “abandoning” his leadership role and showing “exceptional disinterest” in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush, Karl Rove, have been criticized for lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honored during the Q Award Music Awards for their epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold prize during the award ceremony next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title piece for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards, having come into the narrower selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said there would be some songs that go beyond such subjects as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song appeared in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached 15th place in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his voiceband.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of main transport roads, alleys, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Nevertheless, it’s hard for even experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty street than an actively used transit road.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It intends to repaint Extra Place to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood who says she is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the house block’s past.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in keeping them.
During a meeting of the municipal council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the construction company to purchase the road.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district official at the 3 municipal council.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
“There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want to keep public access guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it will repaint the small street and set up seats intended, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the street, but it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“The primary concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed street and make it a public gathering spot,” she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the building protection department, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historic impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802 when a large farm that belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is best known as the background for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of rubbish, lump and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public plot, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged part of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter nostalgic look at the Disappearing City"), has published part of the City History Talk about Extra Place, which had appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time, “Extra Place is a small narrow impasse that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of warehouses, closed windows, and weekly newspapers flying past rainy rains.”
With few exceptions, the street looked exactly like this one night ago.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is now located.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of outstanding newspapers.
Some passers said they rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be slightly polished.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior researcher in California Studies and senior director of education sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “Not as good as one thinks: Why the middle class needs a school choice.”
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s campaign mentioned that “the probability of African-American and Hispanic students successfully finishing school is lower than that of white students” – which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s educational plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those first to learn English.
Still, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take for example Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one-third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth-grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of fourth-year schoolchildren scored well on the English test.
This amazing success has been achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach by which education is conducted in an English-speaking environment.This is exactly the point that Obama should consider, said school director Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialized teaching.
Mrs Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico.
“It works,” she noted, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a high percentage of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make it easy to answer this question, but the educational positions within his own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While agreeing on the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation aiming at “only English.”
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close the gap in performance, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling due to further concerns about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The crude oil trade on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by both financial turbulence on Wall Street and powerful storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rising again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Investors once again showed concern on Monday, despite congressional officials announcing that they had agreed on a bailout plan over the weekend, which was supposed to be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to buy up the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout plan, it seems to have failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a statement to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.

Team record set by series in second quarter
Inside defender Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen everything after running out more often than anyone else in the Jets shirt over the past eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumph.
“I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Ellis said.
After a sluggish game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their developing collaboration made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in that neighborhood for another two touchdowns, which once slipped out as an outsider and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't make a lot of effort," Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
“He is a superplayer.
We voted, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played catching, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner broke up.
Outdoor defender Darrelle Revis shot off an accidental throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started it off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot into 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
On the answers both, because the jets dropped 21 points in the third quarter without scoring one, Mangini said: “Believe me, I the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of things have been achieved in a short time.”
Brisbane breaks its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why he is considered by some to be the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to complete the 42.2 km track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has improved his previous score of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Brzselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his diverse career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Brzselassie missed the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions – with sunshine and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish – Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runner-ups like Brzselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched on long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his waist two weeks ago and could therefore not exercise for a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back smelled.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great.”
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rival from East Africa – for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the Rennan drivers as if it were a racing race, and setting world records over the race.
However, this criticism hardly damages the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Brzselassie had reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Briselassie after the speedmakers had dropped.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie has made his final start to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff of Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improved her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She skillfully planned her course by leaving out a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but overtook it after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the lives of the black people, in a city of a very special kind.
Hidden among the groves of the amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic drift, a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: “the city with 5 lakes, three cricket courses, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools, and no prison.”
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
And yet the city it describes – and which made it a tourist destination by bringing it to the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers Project during the times of depression – is and remains in many ways a place of a very special sort.
Eatonville is as independent, thriving and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t know what’s missing him.”
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about racial relationships, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
“We are very concerned about how our story is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the congregation of the city’s oldest church.
It has to vote.”
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and vigilant.
And so rightly, concerns about Eatonville’s image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in the mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five passages in the Florida guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beyond the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, which is always taken care of by Howard Miller, though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and anything-even-always fits into classrooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting the men singing songs about their beauty that were full of sexual suggestions.
She added, “Some people didn’t like this.”
Here, Hurtson is still remembered as a vibrant eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came into the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today imagines something of her respectable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” said Mr. Franklin.
But “she never stayed too long,” he added as he swung in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were wasted.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous writer, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no big commemoration, no public reading in a big style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to build a five-track highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the municipality’s slow two-track main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was submitted as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"During this time, often a bunch of white boys came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
“There was once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s demand to enforce integration by describing its decision in the Brown v. School Council case as “insulting rather than respecting my race.”
Inhabitants today say that while the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some ways, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - one hugged his teacher in the morning and one hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville community.
That could beined for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You didn’t embrace your white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean there’s a cultural gap,” Nathiri said.
However, civil rights helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black authors, actors and artists who wandered over prejudice, just as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone deny themselves the joy of my society!
I do not understand.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out on her way to Hurston's nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-loved Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found on the shelves, making it once again part of the American literary canon.
The long-haul project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time Hurston’s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began in 1988 planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many come back for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans for a five-track highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, aroused real citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little simpler: “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory over the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more visitors, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a backyard in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today it is 90% black.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is required, and certain things—such as the wall painting of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in field work—are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, are still afraid that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew bigger, there was also an increased degree of homeland pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative and diligent, foolish and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, which he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just go through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently on a Sunday after the church.
“But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, we speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers stands and the huge TV screens on Times Square, they’t even realize that they’re in the midst of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, every day have the worst horror working day since the 1929 stock market crash.
Suppliers are still pushing the metal tea trails along the sidewalks with loud taps and carrying tablets loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still gliding around between apartments as human packed animals load around the 50 wrapped T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting on their own on the sidewalk dining stalls for their breakfast bagel and it’s still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the end-of-the-world talk.
Though I had decided to set my duty on the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were about 20 people in line.
Not at the exchanges to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service exchanges where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask about the way to Macy's store, and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, so I learned later from Starr, my “licensed personal bank worker,” stood for the same reason as I had.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they moved, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (somewhat like a building fund), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers like a family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went bankrupt quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy management and as New Yorkers drove home over the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion in savings, was looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and store employees who stood in front of me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorkers have adopted a flowing financial latitude in recent weeks.
A woman who was calling in my Chinese supermarket was referring to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its faint-looking chief executive Dick Fuld with so much familiarity, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, who is around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my residential block, has gone away from our usual conversation topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
“I’ve changed, I don’t take any risks anymore.”
Muslim graves damaged in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a leftist of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, painted with a red line.
Police accuse far-right extremists of corrupting a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties recorded significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials believe this is an attempt to cover up the motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the news of the grave shame that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan approached the end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscientious polls in Austria, after the country slid to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties receiving almost 30 percent of the votes, advocated a strict anti-immigration law in their election campaign and some of their election statements were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on towels and burkas and even expressed his aversion to foods generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of the continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which say that the far right is the politically strongest block in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of sexual abuse of children, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges suspended Glitter for six months after informing the authorities that he intended to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after presenting evidence to judges for Glitter’s preliminary sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, whose real name was Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A court spokesman: “On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police requested permission from Ashford District Court to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from traveling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present.
As required by the Sexual Offenders Register, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he intends to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible location in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said: “The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
“In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“It is Kent police’s primary concern to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he felt uncomfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him go through passport checks and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted he would return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London after Scotland Yard had successfully sought permission to request that he be registered as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in 1999 for 4 months in the UK for possession of images of child abuse.
Interior Minister Jacqui Smith said she was reassured and pleased that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
‘I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character’, Günter Brauer, photographer.
No passes, no Russians, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find gestures typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look, or the expression of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people' the German photographer Günter Bauer depicts a varied Theatralik of some stage performances with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco display at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the Month of Flamenco Photography, “reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day,” the artist explains and makes it clear that “Flamenco people” “can be anyone, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not need to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco comedians with the camera.”
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images that resemble classical photography were created.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
This is not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the artist’s personality, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the near future in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous figures in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take this idea back two years ago and realize it as “portraits of veterans of the sport” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts of the ‘Flamenco-people’ project vary, the photographer admits, ‘I love photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer period of time.
I think that in the field of photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
The collection of portraits of today’s flamenco with the title ‘Flamenco people’ is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa has admitted that the Roma he is writing about is a “glamour.”
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel starring the protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the favourite Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is dealing with is “a genius” and “everything suggests he shouldn’t write the novel.”
‘If I were prudent, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel at some point,’ so he ended his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award and whom the majority of attendees cast their voices, is compared to the old edition of Our Mutual Friend and can be seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had a audience in front of him who realized that the Peruvian, who possesses a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature emerged from ‘extraordinary passion for adventure’, from ‘pleasure in reading’ and from ‘more than before’; how he writes and ‘maintains discipline’ to supplement ‘the lack of inspiration’, his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what ‘memory images’ are the basis for his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that there is “no way” to measure and how to know whether books change lives, “but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,” Vargas Llosa emphasized, who claims that it produces “effects” and “disrupts people even more,” so I asked the writers “not to give up on ease” and “to take responsibility” for his vocation.
At the party in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play in: bullfighting parties were partially discontinued.
After the announced bullfighters found that the floor of the square was in poor condition, the bullfight party, which was to close the party in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
So the organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfight.
Thus, the feast was subjected to unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
There was a celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante struck two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had managed more by galoping than by his art of bullfighting.
And worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
Having fought so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second battle with buch cries.
In Álava, two people tried to escape the control of their car, loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers urged the drivers to stop the car, after which they fled.
It looked like they didn’t have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., according to the Basque State Ministry of the Interior.
The man was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out route control.The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The officers began the pursuit until the car stopped at the edge of the lane after a few kilometers.In that moment, the drivers got out of the car to escape through a country road into a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers carried 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later sent to other police stations for accurate laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the identification mark was 'double' so it did not match the identification mark indicated on the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was carried out for counterfeiting official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to establish the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and he will be presented to the arrest judge in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for her role as Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness watched her trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, a spokesman for the California Traffic Police told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear “pressed the gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise trying to move her car back or forward from the parking lot, and as she drove back, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.”
A little later, the witness, who initially probably hadn’t noticed the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby road and coming out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she was 'fearful for Locklears life'.
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street, thus blocking traffic.
‘She seemed to be unoriented,’ so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `Following the initial observations of officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance, which could not be determined, and placed in a local investigative detention center around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was fired from a clinic in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, assured today that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall of Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
“In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who will have to take responsibility for it,” Llamazares pointed out on the approach the party must take to the one who is still sitting as a city council in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations that Silva could have started: 'The VL has always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this subject, he emphasized that education has ‘a strict ethical code for all public offices’.
‘Sangre de Mayo’ by Garci
Inspired by ‘Episodios Nacionales’ by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci represents in ‘Sangre de mayo’ the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French.
In this way, the cineast has tried to “represent a lot of personalities and social analysis,” which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of actors.
'Sangre de mayo', with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be shown in cinemas this Friday and later on Telemadrid as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this filming his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. This is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to shoot a film commemorating the second century celebration on November 2 in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million paid by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming offers Garci, as he added, the ‘unique opportunity’ to represent, with the help of decorations and corresponding clothes, the image of ‘confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the struggle because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII’.
However, the filmmaker regrets that it was not possible to expect funding such as ‘Alatriste’ or ‘Los fantasmas de Goya’ (two times as high as ‘Sangre de mayo’), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in ‘Volver a empezar’, has contributed through his usual way of working: he put himself on stage with the actors with whom one must first try before one begins to shoot, and for those who hadn’t casted, he seemed ‘humiliating’ and respectful, ‘part of the film director’s profession is to help in the theater and cinema to know what is happening in the film industry in which one works.’
Many actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s just for the sake of prosperity, and now you’re satisfied with producing one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville honors a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who left her mark in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the interwar period, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We are not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance basics helped me a lot in flamenco.
For example, “The Dance of the Butterfly” seemed to me like Guajira, or “The Dance of the Serpent” like tango.
Her dance was sensual and I’ve been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,” she says.
The staging expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he also did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The stage also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes the role of the companion of the artists who were the divas in which he falls in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in such remote places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence on a particular epoch and whose works are no longer appreciated by anyone, and therefore even less appreciated,” Bayón said.
The show will take place at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book Diario de un poeta recién casado also includes the Triennium.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008).
Thus, the ‘Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón’ is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition ‘Juan Ramón Jiménez: ‘Aquel chopo de luz’, which opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council of Culture has also received eight hundred copies of the Diario de un poeta recién casado, published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso.
The United States can’t imagine it badly without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter' and from the then prevailing idea of American cinema, which was abandoned, coming from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic performance and following her.
Let’s see what it cost to give him the Oscar.
He retired in 2007.
And he knew that he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, crying, “my life and my country were the greatest drums of his life.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
As the “father” of cinema and the homeland, he died in a sad moment of fear of terrorists and market collapse, in which the Americans’ degraded self-esteem is hopelessly looking for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue there are only a few people to admire, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift to the country, where it cost him a lot of effort to push against a deadly culture of nutrition.
A widespread wave of astonishment is beating down Hollywood regardless of nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the entire era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said working with Newman was no more or no less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“The greatest of us all left us,” confirmed George Clooney, one of the few today who dare to try to live like Paul Newman lived: holding high demands on righteousness, leading a responsible privacy life, away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there’s someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He once divorced and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was loyal, though there were many possibilities of not being.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filets at home?” he often joked.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was not so proud of any of them as of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympics, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, “Are we prepared for that?”
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it’s not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my judgment, it was the worst street with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it, something like that would clearly not have gone through.
But let’s go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the ticket hole that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chips to avoid traffic jams on the street).
So not so.
Here they just let you pick up the ticket (the first nonsense is just going there) and (after an endless line of waiting) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
So well, things like this are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Aside from the fact that you have to go very early to pick up the chip, there is already a row of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Eventually, as expected, the road started and we hadn’t left our back bags in front of it, even if it had been successful once, but getting them back would be much harder.
In addition, it looked like it was raining during those 40 minutes of waiting, so that the temptation came to organize a popular uprising and assault the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will surely have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think the output was stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect street, I would never think of it.
So I think we will still long dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human-interaction, an artificial intelligence essence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft that is a route planner to move around the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify the participants in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that that person is not part of the group that speaks with her, and that he is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is the future.
Now, the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, there was a very superficial talk about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the most necessary things instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a finding, considering that Microsoft added one or another feature and ‘Extra’ in Windows versions.
Change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Many people say that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That is true.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirming this idea.
Every time, people pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome, and every day we spend more time browsing than in the 'window' surroundings.
What is half of the computer applications used for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 has to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the restrooms for Microsoft employees earlier this month.
On the refreshment machine there is a sign: 'Your search.Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for online searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, or even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for a way to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone becomes a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in Edward Zwick’s ‘Blood Diamond’, just as Al Pacino wore it in Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘Der Pate’.
If we start to list the countless stars appearances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical men’s T-shirt made of cotton, sleeve-free and tailled.
The English speakers call it 'tank'.Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called in a narrow circle 'Marcel'.The legend tells us that the birth of the name is associated with sport and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' outputs everyone for its outstanding cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable) that these T-shirts have as a detail on the neck cut.
And be careful, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of ‘tanks’.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, pants made of cotton, T-shirts with strips, babies, mini shorts
Modeling and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
You are very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is graceful, but full of joy.
Currently, the brothers Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some beautiful and wealthy girls who retain their reputation.
She was in Paris for the promotion of the company Mango, moving her residence there and also makes the presentation of the most important awards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Mercyful and shy, winner on short distances.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came here to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I attended the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and attended the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense working time that is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both of me, are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find lots of ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress up, combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you’re a very versatile woman, aren’t you?
I think yes, but after all, everything meets in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Since I was a kid, I’ve been enthusiastic about clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to swing around in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and at the exams to look in the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself into the real actor’s role.
After all, everything is interconnected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Have you recently turned 30, have you not fallen into a crisis?
Oh what.
I feel better than ever, and at thirty I feel better.
I find that the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I’m not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you’re thinking about becoming a mother, right?
I’ve known for a long time that I’m going to be a mother because my body requires it, and I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
I will bring great feelings of happiness to my child and educate him with much love.
As for film art, keep an eye on the works you participated in and were shot last year.
That’s exactly what it is and I would like it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that ‘La última hora’ and ‘En busca de la tumba de Cristo’ will be performed for the first time.
Let’s see how you like them.
A few days ago, you appeared on the running ladder with Naomi Campbell, right?
Okay, do not say that.
It’s not that I went on the ladder to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we’re showing.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they are not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may fall back because of the alcohol level will have to install the ‘Alcolock’.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the level of alcohol, install this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunk state.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he receives a course for re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Attorney General, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who have been arrested more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol have re-settled in the wheel.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car start when the driver has made a alcohol test; or when a alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the one who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rules breaches in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address that behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
Still, the device is not available in any store in the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time provided by the program, next to the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez de México Airport DF landed the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force, with which the Prince and Princess of Asturias traveled.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced him to use his hand as a umbrella to see the royal couple coming out of the plane.
Right on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people to the airport at this timeShe's from hereor so
No, she is the Spanish, but she has lived here for a few years.
Oh so, very well
But the Mexican press knows very well who the prince and princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including the military protection of 27 naval soldiers, who deliver honorary salves.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long hair whipped by the wind, without the usual 'peep-toes', may have been told that a storm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers waiting for the official accompaniment.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter who likes to joke awaits them.
The Best Premium of Fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion, and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designer and bonvivante like Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the display window of the Mango Filiale on Boulevard Haussmann No. 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company’s second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest store is in London.
There have been so many events associated with thanking fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship at the competition.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother recently died, broke up. He wore the costume from the fashion house and hooked some of ELAH’s jewelry that was stunning. He held himself by the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up with the Baron of Rothschild without jackets, for jackets they borrowed to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, rushed to the store and wearing a pants and a shirt she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress.At a night's walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet trials, so she got excited, remembered the old days, grabbed a bar and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always arouses a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bed lacks and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that is life.
1001 Tips for Stress
There are not 1000, but one more way to forget about chaotic us fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are a few, they are all gathered in a book that says how to get to relax.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to fight daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the work world.
But the number does not rise, neither more nor less than to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of options that are tailored to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called “1001 Ways to Relax” and so the tranquility that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Whoever thinks it is impossible to peace in areas such as workplace through personal contacts, this manual refutes such a belief.
In addition, the methods of staying in contact with nature are offered or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are suggested.
When the adrenaline in your veins stops rising to restore the body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some children talk at night
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the children who talk while sleeping.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be scared, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep talk.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Sure, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Relationships with other phenomena in sleep are often sought, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura, speaking in sleep, but there is no reason to do so.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations, or overwork.
This is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper, or it can be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult a specialist to check if there is a problem, which causes anxiety and thus occurs.
We’ve said it’s a positive disorder, so it’s not treated, whether it’s associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before going to bed.
So, choose quiet play for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are awful and a bit too wild.
For the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be applied to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember what happened.
Useful Advice
Do not wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear him out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if after a couple of phenomena it appears to be frightened, it is recommended to get advice or find out what reason the child has for the anxiety.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), do not put the child under pressure to conduct an interview and get more information out of it.
So you will not be able to anything because when the child is asleep, he is unconscious and can’t think about it.
Furthermore, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Per, it doesn’t tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, there’s nothing wrong, it’s a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Unfortunate ... finally
After a long journey of thirst, Illhäusern is finally on track for success on the playing field.
Without much effort, the yellow-black played numerous goal chances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the host captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot passed just at the corner, Illhäusern would easily dominate the game, and it succeeded alternately to challenge the defense of Denmark by Fonderflick with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two goal chances won by Riahi and Temporale, and shortly afterwards with the first goal for the Illinois by Marais, who was exactly right to take back a ball that had been repelled by Diebold in a first attempt.
However, the illusory goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and was sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, causing his teammates to continue to play lower in numbers.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not encounter any major problems with an illhaian eleven, who only retreated a little to 'compress' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fisherman
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another takeover to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen, who on Monday blocked access to several Breton and Normandy ports, the French president decided to meet with their representatives in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that he will come up with "concrete suggestions".
The visit of the President will take place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, established by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness and safeguard the working conditions and salary of seamen.”
Sarkozy is expected with determination from the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they organized protests in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of ten kilometers.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
The Quiberon peninsula was bordered by a blockade.
Already on Monday, seamen expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from early in the morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d’Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish cutters did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the progress of the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
“The strike will continue” because “fishermen will not give up at any point” and “do not want to go to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents per liter, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid star died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes said goodbye to the movie legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer Updates Supply Forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threat of recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is up to its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, said its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider leaving more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurance company American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering leaving more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was predetermined to it.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of most of its beyond its international life insurance and pension in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
There was no confirmation from AIG.
Among the assets from which AIG could be separated are its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and private equity investments, the FT further explains.
No final decision has been made regarding these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible to repay the loans of more than $85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, including the risk that the U.S. government will receive 80% of its capital and the current shareholders will lose the same amount.
Historic Paris Assembly Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to rescue banks, a historic drop in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final figures, the Nasdag index, mainly in terms of technology, fell by 199,61 points to 1,983,73 and the widespread Standard & Poors 500 index by 8,81% (106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Following the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to rescue the banks, which was meant to restore some stability to the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, MEPs refused to grant Finance Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“This is putting a bad picture into circulation that shows Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come ‘too late’.
“If the project is actually doomed to failure, it will soon be the task of the Fed and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further restrict credit terms,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, emphasizing even more the feeling of extreme urgency, “that every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial enterprise” in the United States “with it.”
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, U.S. authorities planned to acquire Wachovia’s banking operations by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated suddenly, leading to emergency measures in favor of banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” the analyst added to FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the state treasury within ten years has fallen from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827% and the revenue within 30 years yesterday night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama wins on points in first television duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who came out as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel to be watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, though quite remarkable, was not ‘brilliant enough’ to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released a poll on Saturday that said Obama is five-point ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, that is, those that matter now, Obama came out as the winner of the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his rival Joseph Biden at his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,” Bill Clinton said.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop highlighting his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while clearly emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on these issues that were at the heart of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...,” he stressed several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to become president," he said.
A point of attack that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican election advertising.
Obama says he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and accurately, without leaving himself out of the wording.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain has still not understood, but Obama has already understood,” a Democratic campaign advert this weekend accused the Republican of failing to grasp the full extent of the crisis burdening the “American on the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama told 20,000 people gathered in a rainy rain in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle-level' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider to be the most suitable to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“The coming week could be a crucial turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the conclusion of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
After reiterating that he would probably even be able to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the volatility on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were top priorities for him.
McCain, on the other hand, intended to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates thoughtfully rejected the questions arising from the plan to save the financial market of over $700 billion ($470 billion), which was passed last night by Congress and is extremely unpopular among the people.
“Have you noticed that there were elections in Minsk?”
Youth and opposition protesters demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday night to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night since the closure of the polling stations on the Minsk Square to protest the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they haven’t voted at all: ‘What’s the point if they do what they want with my voice,’ says one young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-delivery of visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and the confiscation of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census,” said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewicz, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and with us it is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be opened up.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in a crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has monitored the election process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She emphasizes that voter participation numbers appear to be too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that an election has taken place?" asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was nobody in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in the parliament, namely those who most likely match the ideas of the government.
The silence of the night sits down over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Interview - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained public confidence, severely shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were contaminated with the HIV and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and developing guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to deliver his report, several provinces then set up a committee to develop a new system for managing blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started its work, only 38% of people had confidence in the blood preservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was disappointing.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood preserves and through the work in this field over the following years, we have regained public confidence,” she says, before proudly emphasizing that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec’s population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary remains conscious that “confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has held the lead since its founding in 1998.
“And we had no idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So let us refer to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which exclusion measures are applied when one does not know it and when a disease only progresses slowly, as is evident in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself by degeneration of the brain, inevitably leading to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the precautionary principle we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which allow to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation period that occurs between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood through our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed to significantly reduce the risk of transmission of AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that you would have to distribute 12 million bottles of blood before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood bottles each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood bottle occurs.
I believe that you can feel comfortable getting or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health nowadays,” says Hema-Quebec’s chief executive.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We need to monitor continuously,” Dr. Décary continues, before emphasizing that Hema-Quebec needs to provide adequate supplies in addition to secure supplies.
“The demand increases because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatment is more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
Population aging also affects the blood donor network, which, on average, comprises only 3% of Quebec’s eligible residents.”
Any healthy person aged 18 or older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who donate their blood are not accepted, for example, because they have AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is widespread are excluded from donating blood for a year.
“With these 3% we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that one rarely finds time to spend an hour donating blood,” regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies preserved blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being interim stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, there is blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand each year.
“We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes the program as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all of Quebec’s hospitals.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal’s Impact qualified yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and deciding game of the quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the USL’s first league draw.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a first half without a goal for both one side and the other, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stopped Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that in the first game of the pre-and-return series on Friday, Impact defeated the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattles, by 2 to 1.
In the semi-final, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday evening, Thunder was able to offset a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 win in the Minnesota rebound, but the Whitecaps went into the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
Victory by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to take the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida Panther with a stormfire leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolores in six preparatory games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russians warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He was too fixed on it in the first half,” said Guy Carbonneau.
I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.”
Charest sets to the north
The prime minister does not rule out the possibility of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the liberal party’s general assembly was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s partial election.
‘Shifting the course of our last great border in the north’ is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented with visual means yesterday at the general assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines entirely.
During his lecture, a kind of painting mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens were spinning spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, of Quebec viewed in 'Google Maps', landmaps, etc.
A lot like during the election period.
In response to the press, the prime minister, by the way, refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this fall, even though he said that his calendar was very crowded.
The “Plan North” is the fourth element of a “vision” the prime minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a “new economic area”, which includes an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches lately, the opening of the North – the northern area on the 49th latitude – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is “a gem with enormous potential,” but did not name any date, investment amounts or precise priorities for upcoming projects.
At the very least, some outlook on what more could be worked on: mainly on water energy, forestry, but especially on the mining sector, favored by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest’s list, the North possesses “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.”
This 'area twice as large as France' 'is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just near us, it’s within us,” he said, as to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founder dream.
Quebec has grown greatly by its connection to the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, Quebec’s technology, the James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments have pursued.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity comes, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
Moreover, "with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the north," he explained, speaking about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable all year long due to the melting of the ice.
In the face of this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy this territory.
What about the inhabitants of the area, the indigenous people and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would handle them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-Peking MP of Ungava) have already initiated consultations in about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources) occupies an important place, has begun the work.
The prime minister does not rule out a large assembly, “not necessarily a summit,” but an opportunity “to create a common vision.”
The development of the North will be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be “discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘vision’ as if it were a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have changed our minds to transform the challenges into new ways of growth and development.
This, by the way, was one of the repeated themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s takeover of party leadership.
One of the adopted decisions includes changing the name of the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” Charest said.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the hydropower dam Eastmain1a-Ruper project, Mr Charest emphasizes that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I intend to be there," he confided to his party members, which sparked those applause storms.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this fall, which is possible for him by law.
He stresses, however, that his calendar is full, mainly due to a mission of the Council of Communities in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general assembly of the weekend provided the leader of the Liberal Party with a platform of nationalist plans, mainly of "constitutional goals" that were immediately adopted: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the "speciality of Quebec" in the constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Television, and that they have a veto on the decisions made in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan Nord were taken with skepticism.
The leader of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy for the development of northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up applying them.
If she had done so, “we would have gone much further today,” judged Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the government’s adoption of a Plan Nord.
“But what we want is that this will not just be a big show,” said the party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from his vacation today.
Letters - A Desolate Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former ‘justice’ minister (which is ironic) in Cabinet Harper who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a ‘shame’ for Canada.
This woman, who has fought an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with such shame, says as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing with a government that is the only one of all the affected countries that has not brought home its compatriot captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that are accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier grow there under inhumane conditions.
The only one that descends to a judicial parody to assess the defendant’s guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Association of Lawyers in particular are advocating for bringing Omar Khadr home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that also closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult, after so many years of torture, will be mentally broken forever.
We are not aware of this yet, but here we are witnessing an insidious circumcision of our rights, of our freedom and of our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper carries like a flag before him all the time, and which sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
Therefore, the time has come when there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, at the discretion of a leader who is still supported only by the minority (may he belong to the minority after October 14...).
Many voters believe they find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this dismissal, and nowhere else.
Orwell's Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, deputy general director of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows Orwell’s logic, that the world’s largest gold-mining company sought a six-million blasphemy lawsuit against three authors and a small middle-handed publishing house, with the aim of opening a “public transparent debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge on the truth, especially not in the case of defamatory lawsuits, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to defend one of their opposing opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal battles, by the way, is often to ruin the defenders in order to impose a consensus arrangement that will make the opposing side mouthless and, in addition, discourage anyone who dares to address the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to the public.
Contrary to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada, debates are usually carried out through the exchange of ideas and not by cuddling.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent audit teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion, wiping aside the petitions and letters supporting the authors of Noir Canada with a handshake.
Could Mr. Garver explain how he could at the same time ask for a “public” debate while ignoring the opinions of that public?
Apparently, this word in the vice president’s world only includes the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a pretty narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even blasphemers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does this mainly because it rejects the gold mine’s brutal attitude.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a jerk (during the ‘public debate’ Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, asking them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the search for truth that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it’s impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that don’t please the rich companies of this world, then who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long known how to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuits.
Wall Street rescue campaign: Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and senior members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the most comprehensive economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, aimed at stopping the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by both houses of Congress.
The main contents are: better control by MEPs over the practical implementation of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new orders to limit the number of houses seized due to default payments, and the right to monitor salaries paid to senior employees of the supported companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Senator Judd Gregg, present at the talks, announced the good news yesterday, minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards a deal that will be market-effective," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
"Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the currency crisis on Wall Street," she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the everyday lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the past two hours, fearing the impact a further failure would have had on investors’ moods.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who took part in the talks late, appeared more likely to be supporters of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on adding certain orders to the agreement, those designed to allow owners to keep their homes, and those related to the salaries of senior executives of state-saved companies.
Asking taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons is nothing to be commended for.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: “I would like to know the details first, but I hope.
“The guidelines I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using the money of the taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgages (subprime) before expanding to other forms of widespread bonds (PCAAs), and eventually resulted in a freeze of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs last week that failed their first attempt to reach an agreement.
Since Democrats have accepted that certain ‘toxic’ assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, one believes to have escaped the impasse.
To round out the viewpoint for everyone in Congress, a decree was also added that if the government would make losses with this program within five years, it would then be able to collect new taxes to reclaim its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of an additional $350 billion will have to be approved by Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies, which will give him dividends in the event of gains, and which can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to suspend the seizure procedures concerning the homes bound by the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as to set deadlines for repayment and withdrawals to be paid to the senior employees of the affected companies.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were more votes against this plan, both by Republicans and Democrats.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House’s Finance Commission, told his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers to cash.”
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called “the Caucus of Skeptics,” views things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to let itself be pressured and carefully consider what path to take,” he said.
At the same time, we have once again been shown in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who has been in great trouble since losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurance companies.
“This is not lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
For compensation, we get the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are forthcoming.”
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was nationalizing another bank troubled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all ongoing loans from the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was for a long time his trumpet, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with his charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity, and obvious talent have also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to life.
What a long runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the effects of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more careful in his play, also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and of the explosion of dramaturgic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots should emerge one of the glorious faces of the American Dream.
No excessive ego, extreme quality characteristic.
Because in him a whole country was reflected in love with the self-made man, in the fighter who was wounded in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before having success in the theatre, television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, who became second in the Mans 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he has lived in a role-playing relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and super-sensitive star to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose mystery will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death moved film lovers to Taumel this weekend, while all of his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of constantly changing American film art passes with him.
Then again pushes the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) into memory, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Leather Roof, filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
A much shorter backward memory (1990) is evoked about his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all of his promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role that was meant for James Dean, was recaptured after whose death and made Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which won the Oscar for best film in 1973.
As a bitter and avenging billiard player in Robert Rossen’s marvelous The Hustler (1961).
This face through time, that was he.
Still still him.
In his lifetime, epochs unite.
Young people know him especially from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him back in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the Irish mafia's pat in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who retreated early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his glamour, and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw it, not without humor, as a living challenge to the ‘underplaying’, when he judged his too expressive achievements.
The job wasn’t always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, whom the roles were just flying for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fiesbands or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slide and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true subtle sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of delicacy and sadness.
At the flood of honors that spilled out over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared, “His presence has improved my life and this country.”
Generosity and joy of life were essential attributes of the deceased actor.
In addition to his legendary career, he is now a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s abduction.
We’ve probably often seen it standing on foot in cups full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was pretty tasteless, although we initially found it still funny.
However, the profits from his sales went to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: “Every time and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the billing factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8, the trial in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The defendants are accused in particular of involvement in organized crime, as well as gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including document counterfeiting.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the funds raised from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often attested by fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have flown in part to the treasuries of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, and in part to the private treasures of individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when collecting the tender fees, and the associations are also said to have failed to meet their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were forged.
The bills were purchased at the market in Józsefváros, and the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was made on that round trip north of the Plattensee to which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should explore pensions and restaurants.
He requested bills on consumption in order to be able to subsequently issue bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Budapest Municipality based on these templates.
These accounts are said to have been manipulated mostly by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, who, according to our information, was responsible for drawing up the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer bar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the enterprise says that such a large group would not have adjusted into the premises at once.
Another invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, according to the bill, 130 guests stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters appears to have no limits, as was the case with Pigal Kft., a catering company in whose accounts documents of clients Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá do not appear at all, according to the prosecutor’s office.
As the managing director Győző Farkas told the hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that it was fake documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor’s office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp."
And further: Apart from the shape defects, the fact that the plant is said to have housed a hundred people was also wrong, after having a total of eleven rooms that were impossible to accommodate so many people.
Food was also included in the bill, with the restaurant no longer operating for a long time.
The counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offers travel abroad, and so they indicated Hungary travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company’s billing practice.
As it became known during the investigation, they also indicated VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
In total, the amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company only charged 15% of VAT instead of 25, and the employees only issued machine invoices, but the falsified documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that the “accountants” had failed to make was that in one case they had stated “goods transportation” as a rendered service, although this is not offered by the firm specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor’s office said.
Further formal errors – the incorrect format of the invoice, the incorrect stamp – were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be detected as counterfeit.
The same applies to Ravenna Bt. and the sporting camp Kunfehértó, whose managers claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "error" is the fact that the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza have failed: this company was in disintegration at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore stated that he did not issue the invoices himself.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued accounts for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also alleged to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH allegedly supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit invoices worth HUF 5 million, which were related to non-performed services.
However, there was also a lack of payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the persons concerned forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly connected with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the messenger of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company, but not found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components worth approximately HUF 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the Investigative Authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is alleged to have acted as the buyer of these accounts.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents should also be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he himself had paid the equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian Mauriers at Iván Kubatov’s express request.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the accused, was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was charged with the preparation of the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the procurement, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor’s office believes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT.
Kubatov is even alleged to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were matched to the applications of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the Socialist Party’s non-profit organization Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (“TMA”) in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but they used these amounts for nothing.
To hide this, they submitted to TMA five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft.
These invoices, by the way, were seized during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some defendants are now expected to have confessed to the method of counterfeiting, as they have already been made before the public prosecutor’s office.
It could be a sensation if the main accused, János Zuschlag, decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were, in fact, less detailed, and although he had promised several times to report extensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him concerning the compensation of the majority of the HUF 50 million damage incurred, and whether Subsidian is willing to take responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that Supplement now plays the "offended" after his requests for mitigation of detention and house arrest had struck on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have caused far greater damage with economic crimes and have not reimbursed them, are free, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains denied.
The Psychology of Exaggeration – or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and therefore overestimate the wrong bid.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the magazine "Science", people do not want to be beat in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even exaggerated prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological pattern of this “game” with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play lottery, while the other was involved in a playful action – in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex beneath the cerebral cortex, was measured in the losers of the auction, where the opponent’s overbidding plays a significant role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the nervous system’s “self-rewarding.”
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding the overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also engaged in additional research to track money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they came out of the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was that one group focused on winning while the other group focused on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to make higher bets than those in the control or "win" group.
"These findings cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
They have, in fact, justified the behaviors observed at auctions so far only with the joy of winning, or the avoidance of risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaging neurological processes, so we have now prepared a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases triggered by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are common, however, the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, secretions or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against the viruses A and B in any case, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the much more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people is on medication.
Also, hepatitis C can have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups where this condition is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooers.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected with a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the general practitioner at the first signs of unknown origin.
If detected in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
World Hepatitis Day is celebrated on September 30th, 2004 and is held worldwide for the first time.
The action aims to raise awareness of this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious belief works like a kind of "pain" that is said to have already eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it was studied to what extent faith in God affects people's feelings of pain, the British newspaper "Telegraph".
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electrical shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using brain scan technology, it was even demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project involving, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University.
During the experiment, the subjects were attached a flashing device to their left hand, which emitted the electrical shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermeline".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the believers would provoke a sort of religious trance, while choosing da Vinci's image, because it hardly differed from the other painting and was felt as reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during this time, while looking at either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics that when they saw the Mother of God, they felt “safe,” as if they were “careful,” and they felt “peace and peace.”
While looking at the religious painting, they over 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, believed that similar effects could also be produced in the atheists with other strong-acting images, only to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings of the research.
"Practicing faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases," Wright said.
After these outstanding results, the only question remains is what effect a Madonna painting of Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary even better results?
You are what you tell about yourself
On the occasion of its 10th birthday, Google can rightly assert that it can be found in people’s pockets just as it can be found over their heads in the sky: it knows where people spent their holidays, what specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s chief executives.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwell’s horror visions, he makes the direction: They would just ignore the essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times recently, Schmidt said the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in this world.”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of working on changing the world, Google is still only at the beginning of gathering information.
When asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" but software programs were not yet able to do so because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their internet searches the search terms, as well as the IP addresses from which it was searched, and the pages visited would be registered.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his or her own search history and later access it, so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic are also based the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends tailored products and services based on previous preferences.
Users, however, wonder what happens in the event of data abuse – “If you look at what I do” – some are concerned about Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that arouses fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the rebellion against power that encounters rejection among many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A recent example of this was the recent action against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected from the community site called “Orkut” which also enabled the identification of pedophiles.
Users concerned about personal rights, however, could still breathe in May, when Google together with the civil rights organization EFF successfully brought the FBI to court: according to this, Google can also in the future with no point of the constitution to be forced to disclose information to the FBI on secret request.
(H, the federal government has successfully obtained the issuance of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms list, has been withheld retroactively for two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who are reluctant to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere through the use of Google’s services, mock the company with the indignation due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though they both struggle for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes from its users and provides its services for free, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package appears to be much more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks look sharply at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet – a relationship that has been put into the spotlight especially in recent years thanks to the term “Web 2.0”.
The “Web 2.0” is nothing more than collaboration, i.e. the users deliberately leave traces and take advantage of the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions vary individually, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves in public.
An average teenager can manage his profile on several social media sites at the same time – from Facebook to Xanga, can connect it through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can maintain blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries geostated on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at last night’s party photos, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee is fired because he is just too honestly airing his anger about the company’s management on his blog – one thing is certain: The term “privacy” has now been completely reinterpreted.
Who leads an online life is what he reveals about himself – in this way, you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass Google’s monopoly, can do so with pleasure – like with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google’s search engine but deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on social sites so that they are undetectable, but even Google’s online applications, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be dealt with with alternative versions, which are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
The public is waiting for Google to reveal its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising spaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapidly-introduced services are breaking heads for not only Microsoft, but also other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing opposite: for example, the management of the group has completely rejected a protest of employees after the company's own kindergarten fees were doubled, in addition, the management thought that the multiple feeding of employees is too expensive.
However, the events of the coming months and years could be somewhat overwhelming: While some think Google’s book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now taking the scale that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the “health” system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already delivering the substance to the next generation of sci-fi authors – such as “Scroogled,” the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best of Orwell’s ways a future in which a person becomes terrifyingly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help the double killer of Ózd with the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now questioned two youths who are suspected of helping to remove the traces, the spokesman of the police commissariat Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people have been confessed, and are currently being accused of aid.
According to news agency MTI, there are two girls defending themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local resident, was taken into detention on Sunday.
The man is suspected of deliberately murdering several people for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act for a long time - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, plans to sell more than 60% of the securities in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech daily "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that in the future this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the agreement of the shareholders, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the increasingly aggravating international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers spoke on Tuesday of the "second September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said "La Repubblica" for example - the president has not even been able to unite his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief to the scary situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second September 11th.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the Sündenbock in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is responsible for the fact that the world economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is the danger that Washington has no political means for crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air, precisely at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored anymore, says the Geneva “Days-Anzeiger”.
However, some states could still provide rescue packages to their failing financial institutions and save banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU member states would have to jump over their shadow and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than 100 billion euros were paid to weakening financial institutions, the Viennese "Der Standard" recalls.
Until now, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continent like a tsunami.
Although the “saviors” would not have to immediately “wage” with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to determine in which case it would be reasonable to touch the money of the taxpayers in order to avoid an even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents, if not to mimic the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, a stunning project was presented that inspired Nissan engineers from Hummeln to create new accident-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the automotive-robot-controlled BR23C biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval “private area” that is very similar to our own “protective shield,” Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at a angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers resorted to the idea of a laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-prevention process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of seconds, and the auto robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires at the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
“If it wasn’t, the auto robot’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield – a layer within which accidents are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
This has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the evasion, unlike the bees, can not take place up, down, or even diagonally – it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the tire’s agility.
While the bees here have endless possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers in the auto robot could only use the rotational movement, respectively accelerating and slowing down.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter, more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response using previous manoeuvres, so that it continuously uses only a handful of KB Memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memory is required.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which Nissan estimates will be in series production within the next ten years.
Another application could be to find the technology in GPS satellite navigation, by consciously guiding the driver around obstacles and thereby leading him to the destination.
A Name for the Sinful Child
Now there is a written version of the $700-billion bailout package law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying bad loans from banks.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended Saturday after midnight local time, MEPs reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package after several days of debate, Reuters.
“We have made substantial progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic president in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying the agreement should only be put on paper.
The compromise achieved over the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The program will show effect and it will be efficient, but you have to do even more,” according to Pelosi, “it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the wheel of the economy.”
The written version of the package was released before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday at 2 a.m.), but has not triggered a hike in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then the Senate is on its turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate both sides’ efforts to stabilize our markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, deviates from the initial recommendation of the Bush administration that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy, credit-loaded securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion will be spent, with $250 billion available immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This amount will be spent on buying credit-loaded, bad securities, and the next $100 billion will be decided by the President.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also includes the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion will depend on a further decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other “toxic” loans.
As by the relevant persons of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid to the U.S. financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad assets, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and now relying on state aid can expect that their transactions, called in overseas slang "Golden Handshake", will be cut by the government.
A reduction in wages will only occur in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, so the “golden handshake” is taxed unless the exiled banking chief is deported to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managers’ salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that more people can participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers’ salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank get better again.
The bill requires the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers can recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan doesn’t protect the taxpayer’s money in any way, said California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were driven by the same people who were also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2,8 percent) - primarily in bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, in shoes the prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials are driving the prices for chemicals and production substantially up (1,6 percent).
Prices dropped in crude oil processing (1,4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and slightly in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper manufacturing, as well as in publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, price increases were measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the key domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supplies, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the price increase for gas introduced on July 1.
If you look at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in yearly comparison, the prices in crude oil processing increased the strongest (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 percent was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Prices fell in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The rate of pricing in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.

In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, the price increased by 6.8 percent, while the price of investment goods decreased by 1.4 percent.
The export prices of the industry measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decline of 3.9 percent compared to the previous year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, and by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro compared to August 2007, and by 15.9 per cent compared to the dollar.
No more visa to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will come into force on January 12, the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
According to her, "now everything depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system will be introduced abroad in a timely manner."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but tourists will need to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
She meets with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the "Middle Merit Cross with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major U.S. parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday.
Congress and government representatives announced on Sunday that they have reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the sinking of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama has been able to further build his edge thanks to economic issues, while McCain’s height, which he has been given by the presentation of vice-president candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the bill on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection he has supported with.
“We need to act now, in a responsible way... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened,” he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to describe McCain’s economic vision as “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time talking about it (...) but not doing is no alternative."
The Republican senator said the plan also stipulates the establishment of a supervisory commission for the finance minister, as well as limiting the payments for top managers — something he has insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, Representative House spokeswoman Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press Release of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters have become more confident within the camp - so commented "Der Spiegel" on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (the mirror)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "The Bavarian Revolution exterminates its fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades – now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The breakthrough is at the same time a problem for Christian democracy, as is it for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, marked itself quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
For ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell to 47.7 percent, falling below the fifty-percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the much cited Stoiber era.
The modernization, which is consistently carried out by the CSU in the federal state, has ultimately destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but the pace has decreased significantly.But without effects, the secularization, the educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by increasing options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact – only the voters within the camp have become more critical and self-sufficient.
It is striking that in recent weeks, the classical citizens’ groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with high school and university degrees.
The support of the CSU fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese Daily newspaper reports in its article entitled "Who with whom? party leaders restrained in coalition issues" about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely looked at their cards.
SPÖ leader Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible – in some federal states and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as deputy chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have rejected the bowl-Molterer course.
Repetition in this direction is not in question.
Molterer, however, responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes to the opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ chief Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, hosted by the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union, has begun today in Paris.
In her speech to the plenary session, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz member of the European People’s Party, pointed to educational segregation as one of the most serious violations of the law committed by Roma children, and as the biggest obstacle to their need to apply.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As by the press office of the Fidesz MEPs, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job search, the Roma would be driven out of the labour market primarily because of their low educational level.
“The vast majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small percentage of them can a university degree.”
Járóka also emphasized that education is a fundamental human right that plays a key role in asserting other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could boost the economies of EU Member States.
In the opinion of the MEPs, it is important that this connection is aware of as a broad circle as possible – that is, Roma and non-Roma.
For the sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely they are to become a productive member of the labour market; and through income and sales taxes they contribute to national spending.
“As EU citizens, the right of Roma to quality education must be guaranteed – the poor and segregated education must be stopped,” said Lívia Járóka.
As the MEP explained, a common, objective and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” Járóka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit is held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the implementation of the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: grace for time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election deficit, there are still no heads rolling, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the Tandem after the catastrophic loss of 17 percent of the vote will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
However, the much shaved duo has already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their chairs.
With this, they want to soothe the angry faction and party base, which demanded personal consequences a day after the "Bayerish tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the height of his career – the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the "only ruler" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will in the future have to rule in a coalition.
As the first sign of internal restructuring, Hubers’ potential successor, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be included in the investigation team, which will conduct survey talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing “Free Voters”, on a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the "Free Voters" list Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo has first exploited, to then mercilessly serve the ambitious politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its forces on stabilizing the pelvic stone.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former prime minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks toward the CDU — in his opinion, the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to the success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint force, Merkel can not become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has failed to make a glimpse of her disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the loss of terrain by the CSU will not have a negative impact on the large coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110 to 0
At the elections on Sunday, no opposition member entered the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects irregularities in the counting of the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Nevertheless, the counterparty gathered under the name “United Democratic Forces” (ODS) has seriously hoped before yesterday’s elections that Lukashenko, who in the unfair elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006 renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time, this time would “leave” some opposition deputies in parliament.
Therefore, the ODS has even taken away from the previously planned boycott.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia’s natural gas imports thanks to rising prices. Even loans have been taken to ease price increases, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading the country, to the Russians. So, in the background of the opposition’s expectations, there was the hope that Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other senior politicians banned entry to the EU because of the political system classified as antidemocratic.
A temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD election assessment report, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings – such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD Rapid Report already criticized the campaign on Monday - so oppositional people are unlikely to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present when counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, for example, and Minsk is even prepared for minor confrontations with Moscow, continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the secessionary Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has regarded the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been frightened to allow even one oppositional to enter parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We are struggling with a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way when selling, but nevertheless I see more and more people supporting change, even the elderly," Milinkevitch said, citing that not even the most supported layer of retirees agree with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
“Thanks to the country’s debt and the rise in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the ‘social security’ in the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble,” Milinkevitch said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the election democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe in deeds, not words."
Brunetta: “From now on, breakfast before work”
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
From today, the measure will come into force against those slum eggs that first stamp off and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new “Anti-Faulness Act” was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council of Ministers’ Bureau.
“Turn doors are a means of increasing the efficiency of work through a higher presence rate and more services,” said Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism,” Brunetta emphasizes again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation ends in all the buildings of the Ministerial Council.
Masi says: “The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is no more breakfast during working hours; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises about this with a smile: “A good cappuccino at 7 o’clock works wonders.”
During a meeting of the Higher Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people are present at work each year".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italian public administration.
In the past 8-10 years, their wage dynamics have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate.
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to counter the Brunetta Decree as part of the Codacons-backed appeal.
“While the Minister for Public Service profiles himself with figures about smaller absences at work – the Consumer Centre writes – the people of ‘active lazy’ are growing uninterruptedly.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public officials have come together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree.”
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for occupational illness; such as the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: “Prevention of workplace accidents is crucial”
Every day there are 2,500 work accidents in Italy, three people die and 27 remain lifelong disabled.
For the year 2007, data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the number of fatal work accidents was approximately 1,200.
These figures demonstrate the severity of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) celebrates in all Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Victims of Occupational Accidents to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The troubling data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial importance of the issue of prevention at work," the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his “great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to protect the injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to raise public awareness.”
"A outrageous 'basta' has risen on this; understandable in tragedies, which, measured by their magnitude, trigger some twists in the media and public participation.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
Particular importance is given to the numerous initiatives aimed at increasing the direct awareness in schools by young people who feed on the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness.
For his part, the chairman of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed “how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules aimed at ending the problem.”
“The work-related accidents data appear to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of work-related deaths is far too high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"We don't want this 'positive trend' to mean less attention.
"How do you think that you do basically too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents?
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – says Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting school.”
"A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is required in the face of a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency.”
Mercandelli also spoke of the “progressive deterioration of the protection of victims of work accidents” and denounced the “abolition of the social system against which we have struggled in recent years.”
"The aim is therefore to return the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations decided from time to time by a legislator."
MP3 player accused of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing loss.
This is by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
“The report shows that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music for more than one hour per day with portable music devices for at least five years are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I’m worried that such a large number of teenagers who normally put portable music devices and phones at a high volume will irreversibly damage their hearing without knowing it,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“The scientific findings – as the EU says – show a clear risk that urges quick action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information commonplace.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
“The scientists confirm that there is a rightful concern and that the European Commission, together with the other EU member states and stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music devices and similar devices.”
There is already a European standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB.
This damage can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the EU points out that if users of portable music devices listen only five hours a week to loud (more than 89 decibels) music, then the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk complete hearing loss within five years.
That is 5-10% of the users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the launch shot to the "Commission for the future of the capital"
We start today, in March it will be over, in June the balance sheet will be drawn.
This is the procedure set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome".The Commission met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Therms.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipal councils will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the “official stamp” of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - stresses Alemanno. "It will submit proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibilities remain the city and municipal councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, their mandate will end and the Commission will dissolve itself again, as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission.”
To those who question the competence of the Commission because of its lack of binding opinion, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results – and this will be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Politics too often deals with everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in mind to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective.”
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think.
According to Alemanno, “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to allow our city a quality leap – which it really needs – and thus make a joint step into the future.”
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, "which will not only limit itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look far beyond," not only in terms of Rome's role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president?
A well-known American politician who has a lot to do with being regarded as independent has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and whoined relationships with hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks on Obama are becoming more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet page: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very cowardly: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!”
In fact, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voter’s question: will he be a good president?
Even in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the polling station will we probably know who the real American patriot will vote for.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been hidden until the end.
“Say what you want, and we’ll decide for whom we’re going, for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people there who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now that the black candidate’s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Still, Iraq remains Bush’s weak spot for the majority.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control over the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they stated that they were not really concerned about the information regarding the general credibility.
You don’t feel as alone as before.
The problem for journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the big problems come from the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to assemble the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism is filling the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives in the press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at the national level.
In the local area, executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are paving the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the “killer” of the press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping “it will bring something good to journalism.”
The biggest crack is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of chief editors at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, compared to only 23% at the local level.
Some think it has to do with “security at work.”
The number of managers who fear to lose their jobs within three years is 47% nationally.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editorials", note d. red.) is always an up-to-date topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers offer like it popular to them and so it becomes a matter of taking it or leaving it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high salaries, but the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros a month, plus pensions and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the thing becomes complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often become “sick” over the course of the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: Danilo Coppola remains in Rio de Janeiro
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent’s application, who had requested to be relocated from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is being investigated against Coppola for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the counter-deal in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor’s office had expressed opposition) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and get evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion White House savings plan: A large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s issue of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis progressively divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly dividing into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favoured state institutions and the business community, and those neo-Conservatives who are hostile to “those in Washington” and the financial world, winning voters in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or even already representing: not only in the U.S., but throughout the West, and beyond, will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events, which finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how to behave to the affected families, which are also a huge electorate.
Economically, the crisis appears to be global, but politically, it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen apart by itself and lost its right of speech: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States is in an economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two non-exaggerating conditions – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organization or market will be able to resort in a similar way.
That new emphasis placed on the state-national element, by the way, is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, when we were so convinced that we have long since entered a networked whole range, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the intangible, that we must suddenly see how our future will depend more and more on the essentially material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can all be transported from one place to another in the world, but they are still connected to an extremely tightly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who possesses such territory has an advantage over another who lives in an area without harvest, without water or free of oil reserves.
I now come to the second novelty, which requires a short postponement.
Whoever says territory, whoever says government, whoever says politics, whoever says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of outrage over the existing leaders, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and somewhat worrisome aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, an image of pointlessness, a sense of distance, all of which is directed at a whole class of managers in Western countries.
In this way, it seems that it is the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is presented to the majority as increasingly foreign and overwhelming.
The demand for leadership thus subterraneanly nourishes a branched but powerful movement of de-empowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the immediate shift in the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of American MPs against Bush (and the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
You get the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, has more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West and is further reinforced by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses.”
Keeping your eyes wide open is not possible.
The super glue that lets you climb on walls
To be able to defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a glue and climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four U.S. research centers, one of which is now apparently near its destination.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged into a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered with microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests conducted with different materials such as glass teflon and slicing paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the reptile’s feet and at the same time “problemlessly removes it from the wall,” according to Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
“This material could be used as a transient glue,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers are more likely to think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could fall into the space field.
The superheroes have to wait.
The other type of research – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a glue made of micro-fiber that, like hair, cleanses itself from dust by moving on a surface, thusining a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: Never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed especially in the summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if taken simultaneously with certain vital medicines, as they can affect their absorption by the body in extreme ways.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed out the risks of packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake.At the 236th Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again raised the alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture in a report two years ago, and emphasized paying attention to what is taken in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or methadone.
It’s NOT just grapefruit – according to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such findings are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the packaging leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, not to be ashamed to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa Agency.
Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event had been more decisive in U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received no little polemic as a response and was presented to the economist even years later, but today turns out to be entirely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “economist of great value”, but also a banaliser with a “very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software, as a free substitute for Microsoft’s Office, is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intense work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presented to the audience with some novelty: in addition to a revised and now Spartan-designed Start menu, it is now finally achieved from scratch compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also on the compatibility with Microsoft’s Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Some new features are also interesting, such as one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email.This includes the ability to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while retaining the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to include the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most significantly improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited multi-handed by different users, avoiding conflicts during changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is assigned a query to guarantee a better correction process.
Some companies are about to release various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. So it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
However, free of charge can be an incentive for the spread of the program in private households, so it is also in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text generator; Calc, the table program, which aims to replace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with Powerpoint; Dbase for running databases instead of the more well-known Access; and lastly Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens in the framework of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third classified and winner of the trio of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to be positively tested on Cera, the epo of the third generation.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are one of those that have been done in recent weeks by Labs Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter trials now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest, and informed the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the trick of the best climber for himself.
The New York Times asks: Is Italy racist?
Italy, “the former country of emigrants, has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants” who are only welcomed with resentment.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? this is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young, Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times describes as the "Northern paradox": the northern regions are the ones with "most integration and job opportunities" and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support to the League of the North can be recorded."
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only this.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and to expedite the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also emphasize: “Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State in the fight against racism.”
Student victims of high rental prices up to 900 euros per room
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious tracks. whole crowds of students are losing their right to study so effectively, because their families are unable to support them at this level" – says the head of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the high demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, lack of registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized subleases.
For Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures, which will result in lower rental prices through a revision of the taxation.
A closer look at the study shows that in Milan a bedroom in the Brianza district costs about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bedroom costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a bed of necessities, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who escape outdoors can save money: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar neighborhoods.
In Naples, you need 300-450 euros for a bed, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bedroom costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above the average is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas will close due to the preferred multiplex cinemas.
A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.
This picture by director Giuseppe Tornatore depicts with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multisaal complexes in the periphery, means, in the long run, the death for the unsaal cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irreversible, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
“It’s like losing a friend with whom you’ve gone through a street full of emotions,” said the director of the film “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso”, who gave him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close, paying for the majority of the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also arise, but first and foremost is the preservation of the already existing, because closing a hall in the city, not all of its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old.
And here the missing budget for the trade union fund remains out of eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is a shame from an ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to sustain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to decide to protect the old cinemas through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, due to its fears; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy that aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public regarding public transport: it will be allowed to drive in the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a pleasant initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to counter the superpower of multiplex rooms, because after all, today’s audiences are more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the municipality's decisions to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The charges of the lawyer’s office of the Calabria Antimafia Authority against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time to compensation of 10 million euros.
“Despite any kind of moral and legal norm,” the lawyers write, “the two local administrations decided to pay lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities.”
“Thus it was made possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to penetrate the council houses by official means and to participate in the policy of public administration.”
The Chairman of the Regional Committee of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links from local governments and organized crime."
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to police, the Piromalli clan was decapitated.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the coalition after the election in May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He appealed to Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, who he accused of having invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant of this morning that the Piromalli clan even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
An interrogation in connection with the investigation of the Dal Torrione case has shown a willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making the actions of the public administration identical with the interests of this clan.”
When the energy comes from the waves, suddenly the great ones rise.
It’s an inexhaustible source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and it’s only now that the world’s major energy companies seem to realize this.
Waves, currents, and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the oceans has been considered and studied for 70 years; not by chance these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When oil prices collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gased out, but now environmental organizations and rising oil prices are pushing for new momentum in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by energy generated by ocean waves.
This would double the amount of energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
Additionally, there are also the streams and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company to now rely on marine energy is Enersis, which in 2005 signed a contract to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was released, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now focusing on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” a spokesman for a company known to the U.S. giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of working with us.”
It is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that in Alaska, oil is continuing to be supplied by the United States and President Bush has just recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Technologies worth improving.
Experts speak of a technology that is still under development, not least because the final doubts of environmentalists have not yet been cleared.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are relatively small and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
But to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected boys.
The push of the waves, which moves the boys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floaters via pins and cylinders.
It is powered by a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this type, which are only waiting for government approval.
Verdant Power, however, is already producing electricity for a supermarket and a parking lot using underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which through the resulting rotational movement feeds the generator.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tide.
According to the Institute for Electricity Extraction Research, the potential in the tides is currently of particular interest.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, sunlight and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is the tide energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to already invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
