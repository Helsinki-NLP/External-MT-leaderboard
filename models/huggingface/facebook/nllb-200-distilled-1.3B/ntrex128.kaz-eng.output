Members of the Welsh Assembly worried about looking like dolls
Some Assembly members disagree with the proposal that the name should be changed to UPM (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This issue arose from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The name of the Assembly member is in danger of being ridiculed in the political territory.
One assemblyman said that the Labour group was confused by the confusion between ol Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: twp  means genus in Welsh and pwp  najis in Welsh.
The Welsh Party assemblyman suggested other alternatives, saying the group was basically "not happy".
The Welsh conservative noted that the group was open to a name change, but noted that there was a slight difference in pronunciation between the phrases MWP and Muppet.
The pronunciation of the Welsh w in this text is similar to the pronunciation of the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a bill to propose name changes, said: The final decision on any specifications regarding how the members of the Assembly will be called, of course, will be made by the members themselves.
Under the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Assembly for Wales was granted the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on a proposal to rename the assembly the "Wales Parliament".
As for the names of the Assembly members, the Commission preferred the names Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but a majority supported the WMP version during the public meeting.
Members of the Assembly will, of course, propose alternatives, but the struggle to get a veto for Commission Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the changes in a few weeks, may present some difficulties.
The draft law on reforms includes other changes to the method of operation of the Assembly, as well as rules for disqualification of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
After the Assembly members discuss the bill, they vote on the final name.
Macedonians to go to referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A referendum was held to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece over the province of Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed membership of the EU and NATO.
In opposition to the plebiscite on the change of name, President of Macedonia George Ivanov announced that he would ignore the results of the vote.
Referendum workers and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev say the name change is just a cost to join the EU and NATO.
As the churches of Harlem fight each other, the bells of St. Martin's fall silent
"The elderly people I spoke to said that I used to be a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, neither of them are alive.
He said that it was understandable to lose everything.
"People interact differently today", he said.
Bars  These are not the neighboring living rooms that people often go to.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last, as leaders expect, and that sooner or later they will return to their original position".
The churches could be converted into condominiums with apartments for people who don't want to live in the area of the temples.
Most people who buy condos in these buildings are white,  he said,  so these churches are accelerating the closing times, so it's unlikely that most people who move into these condos are members of those churches.
Both churches were built by the white community decades later, in Harlem, before the black metropolis of 1870 became the Metropolitan Church of St. Martin.
The first white Methodist congregation moved in 1930.
The black congregation that worshipped nearby had the right to own the building.
The St. Martin building was occupied by a black community led by the saint John Howard, who led a retail boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem that opposed hiring or promoting black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but church members who visited Father Johnson made plans to restore the building and ordered a carillon.
St. David Johnson, the son and heir of Father Johnson, proudly called the carillon the "bell of the poor".
In July, an expert who played the carillon called it something else: cultural treasure and unforgettable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also said that the first carillon in the world was played by a black musician named Dionysius A. Lind, who had moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's over the past few months was a heated debate, half by the aristocracy and half by the architects and contractors, who were drawn by the bishopric.
The institute, which was composed of the chiefs of the nobility and was subordinated to the mahalla, informed the church council in July that it would try to hand over the expenses to the mahalla church council and that the church council had no involvement in hiring architects and contractors sent by the mahalla.
Some church members complained that the community was not transparent.
13-year-old kid injured by shark while hunting lobster in California
A 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he saw a boy crying for help and a group of people came and rescued him.
Hammel thought it was a lobster flame, but then he bit me!
He said he knew that he was screaming "".
And he said, The whole horn is broken. And he said, When he came to the child.
I shouted out to everyone out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!"
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles of the rescue service said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles said the victim had sustained injuries to the upper chest.
Officials closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct investigations and ensure security.
Giles said that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK fashion market.
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams through beauty departments with sales advisors.
As sales of designer clothing and homewares decline, and the UK's £2.8 billion fashion market grows, the big salons are being tested at 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will be rolled out to the general public next year.
While supermarkets once sought to use TVs, shortwave ovens, and appliances in a way that was appropriate, investments in luxury are thriving.
Sainsbury's is doubling its fashion offerings to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also, the existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges take up additional space with branded areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique cosmetics range to increase the number of products targeting the vegetarian direction, which is popular among young buyers.
The fragrance retailer will also test the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second, which will open later this year in Sellie Oak, Birmingham.
The shift to online stores and convenience stores to buy smaller amounts of food daily means that supermarkets will have to do more to attract people than ever before.
Michael Cupp, CEO of Sainsbury's, says that the stores are more like department stores because the chain of supermarkets is trying to compete with the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with a large number of services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and has also opened several Habitats stores since acquiring the Habitats chain two years ago, which it says has led to increased food sales and improved efficiency in purchasing.
The attempt to restructure the cosmetics and pharmacy departments of the supermarket failed.
Sainsbury's tried to do business with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship was broken up over a dispute over the distribution of profits from its supermarket pharmacy stores.
Three years ago, a new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
It said Lloyds would play a key role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the look of our salons to make it more environmentally friendly for our customers.
We also invested in highly qualified professionals who will advise you regularly.
Our range of brands is designed to satisfy every taste, and our attractive environment and convenient location mean that we are an attractive destination for beauty that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby turned down an 11 million pound deal .
After TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an $11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to settle for new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV, Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, was furious.
Truly, Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of homewear and accessories.
The couple's business was connected to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old TV presenter posted on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby, to focus more on her big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV, left the successful lifestyle brand business of Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, at the last minute, putting him in a difficult position.
Jones said he was furious when the media outlet's golden daughter admitted at a contentious meeting at the head office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that the new £1.5 million deal meant they had no time to promote the Truly brand of homewear and accessories.
This business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have doubled Willoughby's fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby was 37 years old, and she took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the United Kingdom to one of her vacation homes.
The media said, "Truly was not what Holly had in mind.
This was supposed to be a long-term vision for decades to come.
His decision to quit the game put all the participants in a difficult situation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to being done.
The head office in Marlow district has a store full of ready-to-sell goods.
The departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions of dollars, experts say, due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and lamps to clothing and homewear and the possible delay in its launch.
It can also mean that a long friendship has come to an end.
Willowby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Johnson and his wife, Tara Cap, for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spent their vacations together and owned 40 percent of the television firm of Jones Baldwin.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin, host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a person close to Jones said, "We don't comment on business matters".
We talked for a long time and then we fell in love.
He joked about comments that some consider "unpresidential" and criticism from the media for his favorable attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so quickly?
Trump said in a funny voice from the news anchor:
I didn't give up.
Trump has been clear about his intention to meet again since he described his first meeting with Kim in Singapore in June as a "big step" toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the talks on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that he did not see a proper response from world leaders to the first step taken by the United States to disarm North Korea.
Instead, the US warned that it would continue to impose sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump was optimistic in his announcement.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea", he said.
We are determined to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
We have such a great relationship now.
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, including the end of missile tests, the release of prisoners and the return of remaining American military personnel home.
He also defended his unusual ways of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there who want to eat lunch in this crowded plaza, we're going to have 200 people sitting right there", Trump said, pointing to a group of people standing in front of him.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and an earthquake are killing hundreds and devastating the island.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, he said that foreign NGOs did not need help.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of the population of Lomboka had to be displaced, there was no national disaster, no international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so there are some difficulties", Ms. Sambung said.
The Children's Rescue Team is currently assembling a team to go to Palau, but it is still unclear if foreign workers can work on the ground.
A spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said the Indonesian government was evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies could be assisted.
Indonesia is not yet ready for the natural disaster, given the constant earthquakes that occur in the country.
Although Acheche has a tsunami shelter, it is not accessible to other coastlines.
Although the deaths were real, it is possible that the tsunami warning siren in Palau was not a simple warning.
Even though the situation is calm, travel between the islands of Indonesia is becoming increasingly difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
To help the earthquake victims, a hospital ship in Lombok is now on its way to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's broken infrastructure a major priority of his election campaign, and he invested in highways and railways.
But Mr. Joko is running for office next year, and his administration is running out of money.
Mr. Joko also came under pressure from the ongoing interfaith conflict in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim community have chosen a conservative form of religion.
When Christians and Muslims clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other cold weapons, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores from midfield against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London to save Liverpool from Chelsea in the Premier League.
When his team was losing 1-0, Sturridge was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal and took a pass from Jordan Shakiri.
He moved the ball to his left foot before he hit.
And the ball went over the mercy-seat of the gate, and went to the upper right corner.
Finally, Kepa jumped over the Arrisbalaga and entered the gate.
"It was just a matter of getting in the right position and grabbing the ball, and players like Shaq always try to push as hard as they can, so I tried to give myself enough time", Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Canté coming and I hit him with a punch, and I didn't mean it, I just hit him.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the first half, in the 25th minute, thanks to Belgian star Eden Hazard, and scored a point.
In this match, the blue-shirted forward passed back Matteo Kovacic, who then went around the middle of the field and entered the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the barrier in the middle of the field.
He then gave Hazard a chance to pass the penalty area and gave the ball beautifully.
Hazard went around the defense and hit the back post with his left foot, which went around Liverpool goalkeeper Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the São Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play Videotone in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The country's emergency agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
A large number of people were trapped under the destroyed buildings due to the impact of a wave of about 20 feet (6 meters) in the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on Friday, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was devastated.
After a woman was killed by a cold gun, police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with a knife wound at 7:55 a.m. at the intersection of Trayson Mews and John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked anyone who saw or heard anything in the area to contact them.
Investigator Brian O'Hagan said: "We are now launching an investigation, and we ask anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have something on their VCRs, to contact us, because you may have information we need to investigate.
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead district and was found in her home.
And the men who knew the woman came to her house at noon, and said, Where is she that has gone away this morning?
The police are investigating the incident because they have informed the next of kin of the deceased.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When she learned the situation, she didn't know what to say.
The residents were told that they would be allowed to enter the house in a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a woman that the entire neighborhood was a crime scene.
The woman went to the scene of the crime, weeping.
He keeps saying, "It's a shame".
Around 2 pm, two police buses appeared inside the besieged area, and another outside.
Within the enclosure, several police officers were guarding the apartment building.
The information is requested to write to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or call 247 on 0800 555 111 with the recording of September 30th.
Cromwell Parliamentary Monument is the last monument to be affected during the process of Rewriting History
To break it would be a proper punishment for the destructive actions of the Taliban, who were fanatical Puritan supporters of many of England's cultural and religious values.
However, Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "ridiculous" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The debate over the demolition of the statue was about the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconic battle of the English Civil War was neither organized nor performed by Cromwell.
Cromwell seems to be getting an unjust punishment for the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's brilliant description of Cromwell is a reflection of 19th century thought and part of a historical figure many people believe should be revered.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Goldsmith said: "Perhaps more than today, at the end of the 19th century, people saw Cromwell as a protector of Parliament from outside pressure, and in turn, from the monarchy.
The extent to which this concept is true is a matter of ongoing debate among historians.
It is well known that this conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell was a prominent figure who was one of the parties to it.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered.
Chinese farmer killed by a killer pig
According to local media, a pig allegedly attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southeastern China.
According to the South China Morning Post, a man named Yuan was found near a pigsty in a market in the city of Lupangshuy, Guizhou province, with blood on his body and a damaged spleen, on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pigsty in Sinin, Qinghai, China, May 30, 2005.
According to reports, he came from the neighboring province of Yunnan with his share of the pigs to sell 15 pigs at the market.
Early the next morning, his owners found him dead and found the door to the pigsty open.
He told me about the pigs he had eaten and that he had a large cup of blood in it.
According to reports, the court investigation has established that the 550-pound (249 kg) crab attacked the farmer to death.
According to a report in The Guiyang Evening News, Blood from the legs of the unit was damaged, and the unit was named Vu.
Video surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market around 04:40 on Thursday to feed pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his share.
The market manager told The Evening News that while police were gathering evidence at the crime scene, the pig was locked away to avoid attacking anyone else.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market management are in talks to negotiate compensation for his death.
This was a rare occurrence, but pigs had attacked people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds (294 kg) had pushed a Welsh farmer into a tractor and was driven away by the farmer's wife.
In 2012, after a pig ate a farmer in Oregon, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that they can be affected by the smell of blood as a stimulant.
They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious ... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them", he said.
The end of the storm brings heavy rainfall to the southeast of the United States
According to the weather forecast, the storm will weaken as it passes through the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At around 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Rosa reached 85 mph (137 km/h), a Category 1 storm, and was located 385 miles (619 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
On Sunday, the storm is expected to move north.
At this time, a line of low atmospheric pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Hurricane Rosa reaches the bottom of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to move heavy tropical moisture northward into the southeastern United States.
Storm Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical wet will then interact with the approaching lower atmospheric pressure line, calling for heavy southwest showers in the coming days.
Rainfall of 1-4 inches in some areas may be triggered by flooding, flooding and landslides in arid areas.
Extreme tropical humidity is expected to cause rainfall of up to two to three inches per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southeast, especially in the populated areas of Arizona, rainfall of 2-4 inches is expected.
A sudden flood may occur due to rapidly changing conditions caused by widespread tropical rainfall.
When a tropical storm threatens, you cannot go out on foot in a desert.
A torrential downpour can turn a watercourse into a torrent of water, and thunderstorms can bring a windstorm and hailstones.
The approaching trough of low pressure is calling for heavy rain in parts of the coast of southern California.
Rainfall of more than a half inch may cause flooding and slippery roads.
And it shall be the first rain of the season in the land.
Some tropical rainfall will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and the rainfall will increase on Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will continue until Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic cools, temperatures can fluctuate dramatically across the United States, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes it causes sudden temperature changes in nearby areas.
One of the most dramatic temperature changes on Sunday was in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is about 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the warm summer sun will set again and expand its range.
In early October, warm weather is expected in most of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures reaching about 80 degrees Celsius from the Southern Plains to the northeastern region.
New York City could see temperatures reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above normal.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts a high-temperature forecast for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of the Brett Kavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched on six television channels the seductive testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blazy Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment dating back to the 1980s.
Meanwhile, when the last minute of Friday's incident saw the network cut off, the political tension came to a head: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a weekly indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had kept her drunk at a university party and tried to undress her.
Kavanaugh was shocked and swore that he was 100% sure that it had not happened.
The video was viewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The numbers for other networks that showed it, like PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not available at the time.
Nielsen, on the other hand, tends to be very careful about counting the people he sees in offices.
In this sense, that's the same as the number of people who would be at a playoff football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the hosts of Fox News actively supported Kavanaugh's appointment and outperformed all networks in the daytime broadcast with an average audience of 5.69 million.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC  2.94 million, MSNBC  2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The audience was also very interested.
Flake was the main character in the drama on Friday.
When the interest subsided, the Republican Party office issued a statement of intent to vote for Kavanaugh, who was on his way to the Judiciary Committee Friday morning when he entered the elevator, and CNN and CBS caught him screaming.
He was shown on CNN, where he was seen crying and looking down for several minutes before he heard the gunshot.
"I am standing here in front of you", the woman said.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
" Do you think you can rule me , since I have no power ? "
Flake said that his office had made a statement and had a few words to say at the committee hearing before the elevator door closed.
Cable and broadcast networks showed live hours late as the Legislative Committee was about to vote to put Kavanaugh's candidacy to the vote of the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he did so because he understood that the FBI would begin investigating charges against the Democratic minority candidate next week.
Flake was half-assured by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuhn.
After talks with Kuhn and then with several senators, Flake came to a decision.
Flake's decision had an impact, because it was clear that Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accused critics of playing political games over Britain ' s exit from the European Union
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May attended a meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was accompanied by an interview with his picture on the front page, his former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, slammed his so-called "chess" plan for Britain's exit from the European Union, saying that the need for Britain and the EU to collect duties from each other was unthinkable.
Wade Sims shot dead: police arrest Dayton Simpson , suspect in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims in a shooting.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Official sources released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WAFB, police found a pair of glasses at the scene and said they had Simpson's DNA on them.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to his lawyer, he was released on $350,000 bail.
The East Baton Rouge Regional Medical Examiner released an initial report on Friday, which stated that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, or neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Highway Patrol for tracking down the fugitive, the state police forensic lab, the Southern University Police, and the local community for their assistance in the search and arrest.
Joe Alleva, head of the sports department at LSU, thanked law enforcement for their diligent work and their commitment to justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was discouraged and paralyzed by Wade's death.
"You're always so distracted", Wade said.
Mexico City is covered by volcanic ash
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after waking up on Saturday, with 183 gas and ash spills recorded in 24 hours.
The center noticed many noises and bumps.
Videos circulated on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in areas like Sochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists observed that the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) from the capital, began to intensify after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and police special forces, as thousands marched to mark the first anniversary of the split-up referendum on Catalonia.
As the police began to push back the masked separatists, they threw eggs at the police, sprayed powdered paint, and covered the streets, usually crowded with tourists, in a thick fog.
Later that day, clashes broke out between the Red Line and the police, who used their batons to suppress the clash.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were confronted by union protesters chanting "Spain is long gone".
The local media reported that 14 people with minor injuries were treated during the protest.
Despite the fact that Madrid has declared it illegal, and a year after the referendum on October 1, which celebrated the victory of the Catalan separatists, the region still has not been able to calm tensions.
Voters for independence were overwhelmingly in favour, but the turnout was low because almost all those opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan government, last year, there were violent clashes between police and voters at regional polling stations, injuring about 1,000 people.
The pro-independence groups spent the night in the countryside on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
It seems that the cherub was forced to move in another direction.
68-year-old electrician Narkiz Termez, who took part in the separatist march with his wife, said: "I have lost my last hope for Catalonia's independence".
We had the best time of our lives last year.
"My parents, who had the right to vote, were filled with tears, and now they are strong", she said.
Despite winning a small, long-awaited regional vote in December last year, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have struggled to maintain their position this year thanks to their distinguished leaders who have been voluntarily exiled or jailed for their efforts to declare independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the march on his phone in support of the police, politicians on both sides of the conflict.
"The situation is getting worse", he said.
One of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since last year, Oriol Junqueras, announced that he would run for the European Parliament on Saturday.
"My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to expose the decline of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish government", he said.
Londoners arrested for driving into house
In Londonerry, men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested for driving into a house several times.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 British Summer Time on Thursday in a row of houses in Ballinagarde that had been standing for half a month.
Detention inspector Bob Blemmings reported damage to the gate and the building itself.
Maybe at some point, the car was hit by an arrow.
Menga's goal put Rangers behind and brought a 1-0 win to Livingston
First goal of Dolly Menga confirmed the victory of Livingston
Livingston, who had moved up one league place, led Rangers to their second defeat in 18 games after being appointed manager of Steven Gerrard Aybrooks.
Dolly Menga was the exception, as Gary Holt's team had to beat Hibernian to a draw.
Gerrard's team failed to win an away game in the Premier League this season, and he was left behind by 8 points to face the upcoming Sunday's leading Hartz.
Rangers had previously hosted the Vienna Rapids on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston maintained his league-leading record for six games, and Kenny Miller took a bitter taste of defeat from Holt, who replaced him last month.
Livingston has been able to show off his talent in front of the audience
Holt's team was in a position to beat Rangers with a straight game and get a little bit ahead before scoring.
Scott Robinson was able to make a run for it, but he was held back in the goal, and then Alan Lithgow tried his best to get Craig Halkett's headed goal.
The organizers were happy to see the Rangers play, knowing that they would be able to squeeze the away team when the game continued.
The goal was scored in exactly this way.
Rangers missed the penalty, and as Livingston reached the goal line, Declan Gallagher and Robinson approached Menga, who caught the ball and scored from the centre of the penalty area.
At this point, the Rangers had the upper hand, but they couldn't get past the strong goal defense and didn't have any threat to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Despite this situation, Alfredo Morelos took the shot from goalkeeper Kelly, which was not used until the second half.
Scott Pittman was tackled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow returned a touchdown in another standard approach by Livingston.
Livingston's penalty area was filled with cross passes and was filled with passes, but two penalty kicks were given - one for Halkett's resistance to Glenn Middleton's substitution, and one for a handed kick.
Livingston has left a   analysis
BBC Scotland commentator Alasdair Lamont and Tony Macarooni from the Arena Stadium
It was a remarkable game and result for Livingston.
We thought it was a miracle that we got to the top and that nobody was missing.
Their style of play and composition have not changed since their return to the top, but the high reward is due to Holt, who has worked tirelessly for the team since his arrival.
And you can imagine how many heroic players he has.
Captain Halkett put together a great offense and played an unparalleled game, while Menga completely beat Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall from start to finish.
The Rangers' spirit is gone.
It was a big deal in Gerrard's day, and it seems to have fallen to that level.
They missed the final ball, and when it came to the home side, they had to take into account the Rangers, who were just out of the middle of the table.
Erdogan received warmly in Köln
The Turkish and German leaders, who met for breakfast in Berlin, were greeted with warmth and open skies on Saturday (September 29).
This is the last day of President Erdogan's prestigious visit to Germany, which aims to revive relations with NATO partners.
They had a disagreement over human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turkish citizens living outside Turkey.
Police had a fence in place to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters began to gather nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of mainly Kurdish opponents of Erdogan protested loudly against Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him.
The guest, who was seen as a peer by some Germanic Turks and a dominant by others, was apparently the cause of the dispute between the two sides.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist involved in traffic accident
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 a.m. British Summer Time, at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn, a busy street in the Deptford area, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped, and despite the efforts of the ambulance, the man died on the spot.
This accident happened months after a cyclist was killed on Saturday in Childers Street, a mile from the crash site, and the man who did it fled.
Officers are identifying the man and alerting his family, London police said.
The road is being closed and buses are being diverted to the bypass, and drivers are asked not to approach the scene.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in riot
The prison administration reported that six prison officers were injured in the riot in the prison for men with strict regulations.
The outbreak began at the Long Larten Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British Summer Time and has not been reported.
To quell the riot, special Tornado officers were called in and locked the prisoners in one wing.
Officers with minor facial injuries received medical assistance at the scene.
A prison official reported: "Specialised prison staff have been mobilized to quell the riots at the Grand Master's Long Lartin Prison.
Six injured workers received medical assistance.
We will not tolerate any disorder in our institutions, and we hope that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will be in prison for a long time.
The Long Lartin prison of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison manager announced that the prisoner was being treated in hospital for an attack.
In October of last year, a special police unit was called to the prison to quell a large riot involving billiard balls being thrown at the prison officials.
Flood threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (may have positive effects on drought-affected areas)
It's hard to believe that a tropical depression has reached Arizona, but it's going to start like this next week, with the force of Hurricane Rosa sweeping the southwest desert, bringing torrential downpours.
The National Weather Service has already launched flood watches for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to arrive Monday night in the rain and head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix State Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles (321 km) of Phoenix have been in tropical storm or depression status!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that occurred within 40 miles (64 km) of the Arizona border .
The State Flood Warning Center predicts rainfall levels of 2 and 4 inches, with rainfall averaging 6 and a half inches per day in Mogollon Bay, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern United States, particularly the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin Mountain Range, it can go up to 1 and 2 inches, or 4 and a half inches.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the Rose Rain is a natural gift, because the region is not exposed to drought.
The risk of flooding is high, but the lack of rain is also a positive factor, as the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought of the second highest category, reports weather.com.
In the direction of its movement, the Rosa Falls will first cover the Mexican lower California.
Rosa was still in the air and was expected to pass 385 miles (619 km) north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with winds of 85 mph (137 km/h) early Sunday morning, and travel north at 12 mph (19 km/h).
When the storm comes upon the cold waters of the sea, he begins to lose his strength.
It is expected to pass over Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday night or later.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall can be heavy, causing flooding.
"The storm is expected to bring rainfall of up to 36 inches or 10 inches from lower California to northwestern Sonora", weather.com reported.
After that, Rosa moved northward across Mexico as a tropical storm, becoming a tropical depression on the Arizona border early Tuesday, passing over Arizona and reaching southern Utah late Tuesday.
"The main threat from Rosa or its trail is heavy rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert region", the National Hurricane Center said.
The forecast is that such rains will cause life-threatening floods and floods in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Four people arrested for murder in Midsomer Norton attack
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old man was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found on the grounds of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Sunday, around 04:00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.
Two men aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area of Avon overnight, Somerset Police said.
The officers asked if anyone had recorded the incident on their cell phones and asked them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the betrayal and anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a blow to the ruthless and brutal tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "outraged" by the betrayal and anger of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress in a dramatic and unprecedented defence of the accusation that Christine Blasey Ford raped her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also responded at the arraignment.
As the president said on Saturday, the Americans saw the wisdom, character and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"You can think of voting for Judge Kavanaugh as supporting the most qualified legal professional of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable public service record", he told supporters in West Virginia.
The President described the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections and indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's candidacy.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm in a hurry".
I am a good candidate for the job.
Trump said the Democrats were on a path to opposition and obstruction.
The first main procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior aide to the Republican Party leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died and the death toll is rising in Indonesia following the earthquake and tsunami
At least 384 people were killed and many more were swept away by massive waves that hit the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
When the waves of up to six meters (18 feet) hit the beach on Friday, hundreds of people were gathered to celebrate on the beach in the city of Palo, many people were killed and all who were in the way were killed.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
People were still busy on the beach when the tsunami threat arose and did not immediately flee and were killed,  said the representative of the Indonesian Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come with it, it washed away cars, timber, houses and hit everyone on land, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was moving at 497 mph (800 km/h) in the open sea before hitting the coastline.
"Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami", he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Agency for Disaster Management showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were washed away and destroyed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The earthquake was felt in the city of the coast on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, at the end of a long, wide bay, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
The death toll and damage could be higher in the area known as Donggala, located 190 miles (300 km) north of Palu along the coastline, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake,  said Nugroho.
According to Nugroho, communication with Donggala is completely lost and there is no information.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living there and that staff and volunteers were traveling to the affected areas.
The report said that the incident was a tragedy, but it could have been worse.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami to Palu, but officials said the waves came at the time of the tsunami warning.
An amateur video posted on social media shows a man standing on the top floor of a building, loudly warning people on the street below about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the wall of water would collapse onto the shore, washing away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a total power outage around the city of Palu, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuees still need food and other basic items.
The city airport is open only for humanitarian purposes and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has reached over 800.
This is bad.
According to Mr. Doceba, World Vision staff arrived safely in Palo, where they were housed in a canvas shelter set up in the courtyard of their office, where they witnessed the destruction on the way.
"They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses", he said.
This is bad.
Although relief groups have started urgent actions to activate the mechanisms for disaster relief, some have complained that experienced foreign aid workers are being prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the start of foreign funding, material resources and personnel is allowed only if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
But that has not happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Auliya Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government confirms that this is a national disaster, we can allow international assistance, but we don't have that status yet.
Although it's the second night in the city of Palo after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing are hopeful that their loved ones will return to clear the horrors of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer system.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out the woman, who had been cradled for two days under the rubble.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other guests who stayed at Roa Roa's hotel included Mr. Mandagi, who had some disciples.
"Because I was a paragliding supervisor, I had a personal emotional pain", he said.
Mr. Hendon said that he sent WhatsApp messages to the participants of the beach celebration in Palo after news spread among the paragliders that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed.
And when he sent forth messages, behold, instead of the blue wings, there was a grey one.
"I think it means that the messages were not sent", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a cash machine in Newport , Libya
A press release from the Newport Police Department reported that on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in Newport, Va.
In the report, Detective Dennis McCarty wrote that the driver was preparing to release the ATM at the amusement park and deposit extra money.
When he was about to get his hands free, another man ran after the Brink employee and stole a bag of construction money.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of participants.
Anyone with information about them should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, she announced the change on Twitter, writing: "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she was expected to appear on her new album, Yandhi.
According to the show's producer, she will replace Ariana Grande, who withdrew from the show for "emotional reasons".
West also said that the word had religious meaning for him, as well as being a shortened form of his current professional name.
I think j is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means without,  said West earlier this year when he was teasing the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, he is us.
It comes from Kenai, it means one thing, it's just a reflection of our goodness, our badness, our failure, everything.
The album  is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the few rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, Pee Dee Dee or Dee Dee, but this year he chose Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, Jay Z, also used his name with or without a dash and capital letters.
President of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in the Plaza de Tlatelolco that he would never use military force to stop the Mexican people.
As leftist student movements were emerging throughout Latin America, on October 2, 1968, the military opened fire on a peaceful march in the square, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly student aid and opening additional free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are the reasons why young people join criminal groups.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
Mr. Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI expert who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that China is becoming more active in AI, and the United States should double its investment in AI research.
The explanations came after some parts of the US government made statements about AI, although there is no official strategy for AI in the US in general.
China announced its plan last year: it aims to become the world leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
Given that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, and we look forward to the next breakthrough in AI, said Li.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding for artificial intelligence could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in the field will be in the United States.
Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order book published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt  Lee is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, one of the most prominent companies in China in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that won him the American top Othello player, and later he became the managing director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee also praised the US government's previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next visionaries.
Mr. Lee said that researchers in the United States have to work hard to win government grants.
"It's not China that is taking academic excellence away from us, it's corporations", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have recruited top scientists from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Mr. Lee said that changing immigration policy could help the United States improve its AI research.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should be given green cards automatically", he said.
China's State Council announced a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China (NSF) and other government organizations provide funding to people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,  Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense announced the creation of the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation now invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
The US legislation that tried to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence did not take action for months.
Macedonians vote on renaming of country in referendum
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which could help resolve a long-running dispute with Greece that has blocked its application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province in the north called Macedonia, has vetoed its name as a claim to its territory, and its membership in NATO and the European Union.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change could undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Georgy Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about the minimum turnout of 50 percent of voters needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: Do you support the agreement with Greece and its membership in NATO and the European Union?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is the right decision for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia to join the European Union and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, for their opportunity to live freely in the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, a resident of Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would support it to make the vote clear.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Commission reported that there were no reports of violations of the rules until 1 pm.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, we should be in Europe", said 62-year-old Yosse Tanievski, a voter from Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, to change the name of the country in Macedonia, which would pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by the people who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the European Union, but we do not want to enter through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can look to other countries like China and Russia to join the Euro-Asian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will bring the necessary investments for Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that the majority will support it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of the survey will be a confirmation of our future.
According to a poll published by the Institute of Political Studies on Monday, the referendum is expected to be attended by 30-43% of voters, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV channel showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the referendum is the first major blow to the policies of the Western government that came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero approaches goal after passing through the entire defence of Brighton
In the 2-0 win against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly broke the defence of Brighton.
Aguero did it in the 65th minute, and it was a laugh.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field when the combination started.
He ran through three defenders from Brighton before he was able to get on the field.
And then Aguero was stuck in the middle of four players in blue shirts.
He passed a defender, and then he passed a few other players on the edge of the Brighton field.
And then he passed it to Sterling.
The English striker scored the first touch in the penalty area and returned it to Aguero, who then kicked right-footed towards Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and hit the right side of the net.
Aguero has a slight leg injury, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
And this is what happened.
He scored a goal and we were on our way.
But in the Premier League, the blue shirts were given the initial advantage by the same Sterling.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero took the ball inside the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a nice pass with that cover.
Sane touched the ball several times before sending Sterling to the far column.
The striker in the blue shirt threw the ball into the net before he left the edge of the field.
On Tuesday at 12:55 pm, Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at the Rhein-Nekar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against Rokiz as a point taker
After the elimination of the Nationals from the playoffs, there was no reason to rush the next start.
However, the ever-active Scherzer hopes to pass the ball on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are playoff implications for the Rockies, who still have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies earned at least a wild-card early in Friday night's 5-2 win over the Nationals, but are still trying to cement their first division title.
We can play a game, but at least we can get into the game knowing that it's going to be the atmosphere of the people in Denver and the team that's going to be playing at the highest level this year.
Why wouldn't I want to race here?
The Nationals will now announce the starting lineup for Sunday's game, but it looks like they will give Scherzer the ball in this case.
Scherzer, who made his 34th start, practiced on the pitching field on Thursday and pitched on Sunday in his normal form.
The right-hander is 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
When the president spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, he indirectly referred to the case of Brett Kavanaugh, who was elected to the Supreme Court.
"Everything we do will be decided in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big ones,  I'm not just running for office, but I'm actually running for office, so I'm going to fight for good candidates everywhere,  he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing this ugly bunch of radical Democrats, and you're seeing this happening right now.
And they shall take the kingdom by force, and shall make an abomination to be seen.
They don't care who they hurt, who they oppress, in order to gain power and control, they need power and control, and we're not giving it to them.
According to him, the goal of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct.
"You've seen this over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, nasty and hypocritical".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee's impeachment of Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, and it was met with a roar from the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you allow the document to be shared?
No, no, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for someone  that was really bad sign language  that was the worst sign language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
He is intolerant of people who express their opinions openly
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, it was not a surprise.
And finally, I am the last of the Labour MPs who said they didn't support us, because we all have our say.
This is the attitude that my colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, had because she was a staunch opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the blame game was trying me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
There were similar issues Jeremy disagreed with his predecessors about the importance of responsible economic policies, about national security, about Europe.
The Nottingham East Labour Assembly said in a statement that it wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, that's what the UK's Friday night meetings were.
Unfortunately, it's not a promise that many meetings are making these days, and the promise of a "better, softer" policy, if it was common, has long since been forgotten.
It is becoming clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is evaluated in terms of its validity for the leadership of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who had previously thought we had similar political views turned on me and expected me to take positions that I would never agree with on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, and whatever I say, there are comments on social media that call for voter suppression, criticize the policies of the Centre, and that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
In fact, I know I've been more involved than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and courage of my colleagues who experience sexism or racism every day, but who do not hide it.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of politics is how bullying levels have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party needed to develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a group of people with different views and the party is being limited by "expressing disbelief" or changing the rules of choice.
Over the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice to be cool, to be inactive, and to be better.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which left my schoolroom in a state of complete disrepair, I have been involved in Labour since I joined as a schoolboy 32 years ago, and I have worked to support the highest level of public services, whether as a local councillor or government minister, for those who need them most.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
In Nottingham East, no one could ever be confused about my political positions and my disagreement with the current leadership.
And I want to say to all of those who supported this movement on Friday, that I don't understand why I would need to spend time and effort to be loyal to the leader of the Labour Party when we're going into Brexit, which is going to hurt households, institutions and public services in this country.
My only appeal is not to the Nottingham Momentum movement, but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that the possibility of my disqualification or any political advantage will not prevent me from acting in the way I believe is best for you and for all of you.

Air 38  17 Melrose: Unbeaten Air is the first place
The two late attempts slightly distorted the final result, but in this very exciting match of the Tennant Premier League, there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win.
They are in the tenth part, and they are on the top of the table.
In the end, their excellent defense, as well as their good use of the opportunity, led to the victory of the owners of the pitch and the coach Peter Mercy had every opportunity to be satisfied.
We have been tested through our games so far and we have not lost yet, so I should be happy, he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose team said: "We have to give the Air Club a fair price, they have used their opportunities better than we have.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute move by Fraser Klim led the A's, but the yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was sent off by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score and Jason Baggott took an unperformed move.
Klimo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, in the first half of the game, he scored, and then played a solo at half-time to try to make the score 17-5 in Ayr's favor.
However, Melrose started the second half well and a move by Patrick Anderson, performed by Baggott, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was carried off the bench and after the game resumed, Air Club moved on further through the action of Stafford McDowell, played by Klimo.
Then, acting Air Club captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose was paid again in the end of the season by an additional person for an unfulfilled act by Bruce Colvin.
However, the owners came to their own and when Strawan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for holding Climo without the ball, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty area line behind Eyre's cross near the ball.
After Kyle Rowe took a punch from David Armstrong into the penalty area and sent out flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team, Climo performed as he had done since the restart.
Star of the TV series Still Game plans to start a new career in the restaurant industry
After being appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company, the star of the series Still Game, Ford Kearnan, is about to move into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old actor will play Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-wrote with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the show, and it seems that they are planning their lives after Keiran Craiglang.
According to official documents, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the situation, but the Scottish Sun reported that Kearnan planned to work in the restaurant industry in Glasgow.
 The sea is ours : Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There is a blue flag on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases have a slogan: "By law, the sea is ours".
It is our responsibility to take it back.
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still the memory of the beaches that were lost to Chile in the 19th century conflict for resources and the desire to swim again in the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decade, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a spirit of commitment, unity and peace and it certainly expects a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians watch the decision of the international court through big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia's demand that, after decades of tense negotiations, Chile be obliged to negotiate an independent access to the sea for Bolivia.
Monday's ruling is also significant for Bolivian indigenous charismatic president Evo Morales, who is in contention for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts said that it was doubtful that the court's decision would be in favor of Bolivia, and even if it were, we believe it would have little impact on the outcome of the case.
The UN mission in the Netherlands said it had no authority to support Chilean territory and could not decide the outcome of the ongoing negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice of the United Nations will be issued within six months after the final hearing proves that the case is not as glamorous as it seems, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And Bolivia is never going to finish, and it seems to have pulled back in the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea is being illegally exploited by the current Bolivian leadership", Zarate said.
He concluded that Morales' bellicose statements would destroy what was left of Chile's reputation.
Bolivia and Chile will have a conversation sooner or later, and then it will be hard to have a debate.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, disagreed with the opinion that the court's quick ruling would raise doubts.
He said Monday marks a unique moment for Bolivia to "open a new era of relations with Chile" and bring an opportunity to end a 139-year-old dispute to the mutual benefit of both sides.
Calzadilla also disapproved of Morales, one of Latin America's most famous presidents, using maritime issues as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
Management is the ability to forget the past.
North Korea says there will be no denuclearization if the US is not trusted
North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yang-ho said that the people would never allow nuclear disarmament unless they could trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United Nations to keep its promise made at the Singapore Summit of Leaders of the rival countries.
He made his remarks after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ready to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that the massive influence exercised and the US refusal to make a formal declaration to end the Korean War will not bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid of making a formal statement unless Pyongyang is the first to make a mass disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump have suggested that a second summit is needed.
However, there is a doubt that Pyongyang's complete disarmament will be accepted as the only way to maintain security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of the second Kim-Trump summit.
The giant headgear that was launched at the Paris Fashion Show is now available for you to see.
If you want to make my fancy jackets bigger or hide from the sun as much as possible, you don't have to look.
Designers like Valentino and Tom Brown have been on the podium for the 2019 Summer collections, constantly showing off their unusual, hip headwear, which has gone beyond the usual theme of Paris Fashion Week.
The top hats have been on Instagram this summer, with some of the most iconic designers taking to the podium with their eye-catching designs.
Valentino's signature piece is a large white-yellow hat with a wide brim decorated with feathers, which is invisible even under the jewellers who wear it.
Other large-sized accessories include jewel-encrusted watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but they're not meant to be worn on New Year's Eve.
Tom Brown also came out with a set of amazing masks, something you won't find on Halloween.
Many of the masks were of various colors, with the feathers sewn, not in high ornament, but resembling Hannibal Lecter.
One was like a scuba diver's suit with a breathing tube and swimming glasses, and the other was like a pot of melted ice cream.
If you're a regular fashion appraiser, this is your moment.
Art experts suggest that it's quite possible to see women's hats on the street.
The overly globalized hats, from Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski, followed one of the two, a two-foot-wide straw hat called La Bombade.
After the unimportant hat that conquered social systems and worshiped the country, another piece came to the podium: a straw bag that was held on the beach, the same as the swimsuit on the top of the designer who captured it.
The bag made of yellowish-red raffia fiber, covered with raffia hair and a white leather handle, was featured in the summer collection La Rivera 2019 by Jacques-Yves de La Roche during the Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see bigger hats and beach bags available next summer, because after the huge impact the designer has made, the oversized accessories should not be overlooked".
John Edward: Language learning is important for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland have maintained high standards of learning, and continued this trend in 2018 with high test scores and individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other collective activities.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) is committed to providing the highest quality of service to both pupils and their parents.
Private schools prepare their students to go on to higher education, to pursue careers of their choice, and to become global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a unique school curriculum, we see modern languages becoming a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, they will understand.
If you speak to him in his native language, you will reach his heart.
It's a powerful statement that if we want to connect and trust with people in other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
And the results of a recent test this year show that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A's.
According to 74 representative SCIS schools, 72 percent of students received A's in Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language learning as a necessary skill for children and young people in the future.
In the curriculum of private schools and other electives, languages are given equal importance to the exact sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons employers reject job vacancies are due to candidates' poor language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, especially in the context of jobs that require language.
Whatever the career you choose, learning a second language increases your chances of using this kind of long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners gives a person who knows several languages an immediate advantage over others.
According to YouGov, in 2013, the number of adults who could not speak English at a conversational level was over 4,000 (75%) compared to 15% who could only speak French as a second language.
That's why we need to focus on teaching children languages today.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developed economies, increases children's chances of finding productive jobs.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages they teach.
Some schools teach some classical modern languages, while others teach Chinese or Japanese, which is very important for the UK in 2020.
There are several languages that your child can choose from in private schools, and teachers are experts in these fields.
Private schools in Scotland prepare children to succeed and develop the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
We cannot deny that languages are crucial to the future of a country in a global business environment, and that this requirement must be incorporated into education.
But we should recognize that modern languages are really about interacting skills at an international level.
Private schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland the same choice, diversity and quality of higher education.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The fans who were waiting for his first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers were waiting for a little while.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would be playing in the season opener in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.
We'll see how many minutes he can play.
"It's more than one, it's less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James could play for a limited number of minutes.
After a week of practice, James asked about the Lakers' six-game regular season schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any regular season games to prepare", he said.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, this evening.
This is the first of five planned meetings for Trump this week, counting stops in co-op locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his nomination to be confirmed for the Supreme Court seat, Trump will increase his support base for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing congressional support in the November vote.
What time does Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's pre-election rally is expected to begin at 7 p.m. eastern time in Wheeling, West Virginia, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube at the link below.
Trump will speak about the Supreme Court nomination hearing this week, which is a heated debate over whether he should delay the Senate vote by a week until the FBI investigation is complete over sexual assault charges.
But the main goal of this pre-election struggle is to help the Republicans consolidate their position before the November elections.
So the five meetings planned for President Trump next week are meant to encourage supporters and volunteers as Republicans try to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and lower house of Congress, Reuters reports.
"Monitoring Congress is a high priority on his agenda, and the president will try to travel to as many states as possible before the start of the regular election season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The evening pre-election rally at the Westbank Arena in Wheeling, which is expected to draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, will likely draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News reported.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia on a Saturday since last month, after winning the state with 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the vote.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president himself is here to cheer him up", Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows its willingness to fight for victory ahead of Sunday ' s individual games
After three games of one-goal play, the four teams that played again on Saturday afternoon were back in the Ryder Cup.
The swinging pace is a pure sport, but it is one that athletes have high hopes for, especially in competitions like this.
The question is, where is this momentum now?
"They were six points ahead, now four, and I think we're coming up a little bit faster", Jordan Speight said as he was driving back that day.
Europe, which has 20 points and wins by four points, certainly has an advantage.
According to Spit, the Americans are still unbeaten, but there are also many inspiring moments, especially when they played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
From the pitch of the spit ball, he can be a model in front of the field and be a model in person.
Thomas and the two-point conversion in the fourth quarter, when they hit the ball into the hole and tied the score in the fourth, the victory screams from the stands grew louder.
His game-winning shot in the hole was met with a similar salute in the 15th minute, a sign that the Americans were still in the game.
"You should be more enthusiastic and focused on your own party", Spit said.
All of the players mentioned are currently out of the game.
18 holes are selected.
The two players who have outscored Spit and Tommaso in the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, will undoubtedly go down in the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but attractive European couple is one of four that never miss a single date.
On Saturday afternoon, the only couple from Hollywood that didn't bogey, they also refused to bogey the last nine holes of the hole on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning.
That cut and the energy exchange with the unrestrained crowd made them Sunday's winners, a day that Le Golf National was born, compared to Fleetwood or Molinari, and showed that there were no other great players to defend the European title.
It is better for both of them to fall into different holes.
The story of European glory, however rapidly it may be, is being told.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were paired with Alex Noren in the morning game, and lost to Sergio Garcia, who was tied for the team lead with four.
The bogey and two double-header in the first half of the game put the Spaniard and Swede in the second hole, but they were stopped.
However, on Sundays, there seemed to be no one to help us out.
Four-balls and fours are worth looking at because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and their perception of how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has been playing better as a group so far, and as we head into the final day, some people, especially in the States, are skeptical, but this four-team setup shows that the United States is ready to fight for the win.
Europe reached the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe did not play well in the Ryder Cup final after beating the United States 10-6 in Saturday's four-ball and four-game series.
The amazing Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari paired up to take the Le Golf National by four points, two wins behind Tiger Woods.
Thomas Bjorn's European side were determined to win back the trophy they had lost for two years at Hazeltine, beating the four-balls that had missed the Americans in the morning by 3-1 in the series.
The USA had more hope for the fourth-place finishers, who had won two matches, but they were ineffective because they were short of points.
Jim Furyk was eight points short of winning his 12 individual matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood became the first young European player to score four consecutive points, and the two Molinari's smashed the Moliwood pair to the ground and became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four matches in the inaugural season after a heated Sunday.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed by four strokes, they put on a great combined game to knock out Woods and American youngster Bryson Deschambeau by a further 5 and 4.
Woods, who was suspended for two games on Saturday, has had some impressive moments, but now he is seventh in the standings with four shutouts and four losses in 19 of his 29 games.
Justin Rose, breathing in the morning's four-balls, returned with his teammate Henrik Stenson in the fours, and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked first and third in the world, 2-1 on the road.
Europe was watching all this in the warm, windy southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas set a new record by giving the Americans two points on Sunday.
They beat Spaniards John Ram and Jan Poulter 2-1 on four balls and then came back to beat Poulter and Rory McAroy 4-3 on four balls, who were two holes behind.
There have only been two times in the history of the Ryder Cup where the ball has returned to individual games after missing four points, although the fans are with Furyk only to recover the victory.
After two days of being the second best, it seems that he is still behind the attack on Sunday.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament is impossible without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued pressure on the United States would increase mistrust and that it would not be possible for the country to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly last year that North Korea had taken "significant positive steps" to halt nuclear and missile tests, close a nuclear test site, and pledge non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we are not getting anything back from the United States", he said.
If we do not trust the United States, we will also be threatening our national security, and in such a case, do not think that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.
While Ri reiterated Washington's well-known North Korean objections to the "temporary" disarmament approach, which North Korea considered to be a step-by-step measure that would be met with retribution, his statement also denied that Pyongyang had previously accepted unilateral disarmament without thinking.
Ri, at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, promoted a joint statement between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump in which Kim promised to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wanted to officially end the 1950-53 war, but the United States said it had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is increasing pressure to achieve its goal through sanctions and resisting the declaration of an end to the war, demanding nuclear disarmament, Ri said.
The idea that we can be defeated by sanctions is an impossible dream for those who do not know about us.
But the fact that the sanctions are not lifted weakens our faith.
Ri did not say anything about the US leader's plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which he had previously announced at the UN.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, saying that if the other side of the issue were South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be so deadlocked.
But Ri's voice is not as vocal as last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that "the devil of President Trump calling Kim a space missionary on a death mission" led North Korea to turn its missiles on US soil.
Trump, who last year vowed to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous disarmament efforts this year, but said there was still a long way to go and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that it didn't matter if it was two years, three years, or five months, that he would not put a time limit on it.
China and Russia believe that the UN should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday that sanctions should be actively and inevitably maintained until a complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved.
The Security Council unanimously tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to halt Pyongyang's financial nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo said he would meet Ri at the UN General Assembly and would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but North Korea soon accused him of imposing gangster demands.
North Korea promised at its meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its missile and nuclear complexes if the US took the necessary measures.
He said that Kim told him that he was looking for "measures of compliance" and "security guarantees" promised by Trump in Singapore, and that he was looking to improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest
To combat the caffeinated machismo culture of studying all night, Harvard University started a course this year that encourages all students to sleep more.
The academic number revealed that the first university students didn't know what to expect.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course and says this has never been done before in the United States.
She wanted to start this course after a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
When I finished, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I only in high school when I hear this?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep before, which surprised me, she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, provides key insights into how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance, as well as overall mood.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, says the university decided to introduce the course after learning that students were sleep deprived for weeks.
The one-hour course consists of several interactive tasks.
One of these chapters is a picture of a dorm room where students are taught about the effects of caffeine and light when they press their coffee cups, curtains, sleeping bags, and books, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleep.
In another study, participants were found to have a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer if they were deprived of sleep for long periods of time.
Then, a campus map with interactive signs will prompt participants to reflect on their daily lives.
We know that this will not change the lives of students overnight.
But they have a right to know, just like you have a right to know about the health risks of smoking, for example", added Professor Chase.
He says that the culture of boasting about being up all night still exists, and that modern technology and the pressure on students means that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
He says getting enough sleep should be a student's secret weapon against stress, boredom, and anxiety, and it can even prevent weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, causing it to become hungry.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old chemist and physical biologist from California who helped develop the course, took one of Chase's classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He says that this course was a wake-up call and inspiration to spread it throughout the campus.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduate students to take a similar curriculum before they enter a highly competitive university.
Professor Chase advises students to put an alarm clock in their beds to wake them up, and to learn about the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: Menga scored against Gerard ' s boys
Rangers suffered another home defeat as Dolly Menga's shot defeated Steven Gerrard's scattered team 1-0 at Livingston.
Although Ibrox were looking to win their first away game since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, Gary Holt's side only gave him their second defeat in 18 games as Gerrard's manager, resulting in eight points to Ledbrokes' Premier League leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers didn't seem to have any motivation to draw the score.
Rangers dropped to sixth place, while Livingston moved to third place, again only behind Hibernian by goals scored.
After linebacker Callum Spence injured his head with a long-range throw, the Rangers could have had additional issues.
Gerrard made eight changes to the cover, which led him to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup outside of Ayr.
On the other hand, Holt came out with the Livi 11 team, who had scored from Hart last week, and he would have been happy to see his well-trained squad beat the opponent.
Although the Rangers had more balls, Livingston made the most of what he had.
They were the first release of Menga, which forced Scott Pittman to score a goal for Allan McGregor, but the midfielder never missed his chance.
Although Keegan Jacobs' deep penalty shot reached team captain Craig Halkett, his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a strong shot from the back.
Despite Rangers gaining control, the last third of the game was dominated by hope over faith.
After a quarter of an hour, Alfredo Morelos believed he had a chance to hit a penalty, as he had been in a collision with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers scored two runs in the first half, but the attack of Lassana Kulibaly and Ovi Edgaria was not difficult for former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Although the action of Levi in the 34th minute was against the game, no one doubts that they deserved it for their efforts.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to prevent Jacobs from hitting deep.
Scott Arfield made no response action, as Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to send it to Menga to finish the game.
Gerrard acted during the break and replaced Coolibari with Ryan Kent, a change that had an almost immediate impact, although the winger overcame Morelos' opposition, and Kelly blocked him from his own line.
But Livingston kept the visitors in their game, and Lithgow and Halkett kept the ball long.
Although Holt's side held the lead for a long time in the final stages, McGregor was able to hold out against Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide attack from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who had just moved to Rangers, had been in a fight with Jacobs and asked for another penalty, but Thompson refused again.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, the Sunday Morning Almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, in the city of Sanaa, Germany, the future physicist Hans Wilhelm Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later became the Geiger counter.
And since then, the Geiger counter has been a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Coronado Bells, these ordinary cobblers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is common?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
And when you put these earphones on, you actually hear the effects of the atoms that are emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: We'll know now!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, shortly after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to recognize defective cells
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to detect and kill defective cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The technique involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a lab.
And then they can look for a protein that's common to many cancers and then reinsert it.
The trial vaccine has been showing good results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches her immune system to see defective cells lost her ovarian cancer in 18 months.
The technique involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the lab so that he can find a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers and reinsert them.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that there is a future for vaccines".
Professor Berzofsky explains that HER2 "increases the growth of several types of cancer" (including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer).
Taking immune cells from patients, teaching them how to interact with cancer cells, has helped to cure leukemia.
Kanye was on SNL wearing a MAGA hat and showing his support for Trump.
Failed to close correctly
Kanye West was the subject of a public outcry after he praised US President Donald Trump on his Saturday night show and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Let's Make America Great Again", in his hat, he made a speech against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"I talk to a lot of white people, and they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
Okay, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", she says.
The SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, who mocked Brett Kavanaugh's response to a sexual assault allegation by Christina Blasey Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Although Wes's words were not televised, a video of him was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock intended to mock West with his post.
West also told me that he found it difficult to wear this headgear off stage.
"They tried to intimidate me offstage.
They said, "Don't go out with your head covered".
They scared me!
They said I was in the same place I was in the Washington Examiner .
West continues, "Do you want to see the flooded land? So I'm going to wear Superman's clothes, because you can't tell me what to do.
Start with love".
He was booed at least twice by the audience, and the SNL cast seemed to be in a state of shock.
West's ex-girlfriend, Mac Miller, had replaced Ariande Grande, who had died a few days earlier.
It was a surprise to many that Wes was dressed like a Perrier bottle and singing I Love It.
Candice Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, supported West, tweeting: "THANK YOU to one of the bravest men: FOR STANDING UP TO THE MAFIA".
The talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that Wes was in shape and that it was great.
But I prefer not to praise someone who promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art).
He is free.
So are we", he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and he is following in the footsteps of Diddy, who was once known as Puff Duddy, Puffy and Pee Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, who later became a music legend, changed his name to a symbol and became known by that name.
Accused of assault with a knife in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhacamor.
The accused is expected to appear in the Belfast Conciliation Court on Monday.
The charges are considered by the State Prosecutor.
 Taekwon-Do star Keith Harington has expressed his opposition to male behavior 
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow, the swordsman in the HBO fantasy series The Throne Struggle, about a violent Middle Ages.
But the 31-year-old actor says he's broken the stereotype of macho characters by thinking that on screen, these roles require young kids to be rude to feel respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that something was wrong and raised the question of how to address male harassment in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently appeared in the TV series "The Price Is Right", and is married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, said he feels strongly about the issue.
I feel a little strong personally, so what did we do wrong with masculinity?"
What have we taught people about current events?
Keith believes that television may be responsible for the rise of male-dominated harmful behavior due to the presence of too many masculine characters.
And he said, What is this thing that he hath brought forth, and what is this teaching?
What is it that young children are taught on television and in the streets that makes them think that this is what a real man should be like?
I think this is one of the biggest problems of our time, how can we change it?
It's obvious that something is wrong with young children.
In an interview, he said that after the series ended the following year, he would not be getting any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels because he was so tired of the battles and horses.
In November, Keith will star in "True Western", a film about Sam Shepard, a film producer, and his brother, a bandit.
The actor considers his meeting with his wife Rose the greatest event in the history of the Throne.
"I met my wife on this show, which meant she gave me my future family and my new life from that moment on", he says.
Rose plays the love interest of John Snow, a character played by Keith in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at their family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China says new cases increased by 14%
China announced that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to official health officials, this number is 820,000 people in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The difference is that most of the new cases are sexual.
In the past, HIV was usually transmitted in China through transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said that such cases are now almost unheard of.
Yet, the number of new HIV and AIDS cases in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a major issue in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been criminalized in China since 1997, discrimination against LGBT people still exists.
The country is conservative in its values, and 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The disease is often transmitted during sexual intercourse by inappropriate protection.
Since 2003, China has promised to make HIV drugs available to the public to help solve the problem.
Maxine Waters, who denied that employees had leaked information to Republican senators, developed a theory of "dangerous lies" and "dirty deeds".
US Republican Party spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that lawmakers had published the personal information of three US Republican senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat says the accusations were fabricated by far-right experts on the website.
"A lie, a lie and a lie beyond", Waters tweeted.
The leaked information included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted online on Thursday and was made public by an unidentified person at the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators investigated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState claim that the IP address that identifies the source of the message is associated with Waters &amp; apos; office and that the information was published by one of Waters &amp; apos; employees (Hill).
This baseless claim is a complete lie and an absolute lie, Waters continues.
One of my employees, whose privacy and security was compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false statements, is not responsible for the dissemination of this information.
This unfounded statement is a complete lie and an absolute lie
Waters' statement drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
The refusal was expressed in anger, wrote Fleischer.
This means that his behavior does not mean that he wants to be a member of Congress.
If someone is being reprimanded for something he did not do, do not be angry.
This name should not be used.
They should not be in doubt about the reasons of the accuser.
They have to be balanced".
Fleischer Waters's reaction appeared to be similar to that of Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics on Thursday of being too angry.
Omar Navarro, who is running for the Republican nomination in the midterm elections instead of Waters, also tweeted.
"If it's true, then it's a big , ", he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said that his office had "advised appropriate administrative and law enforcement authorities" about these fraudulent complaints.
"We will bring the perpetrators to light", he continued, "and they will be held accountable for the dangerous actions they have taken against each of my employees".
Johnny English is back  Rowan Atkinson ' s rogue spy
Now I'm looking for signs of Brexit in the new films that are traditionally shown in Britain, and this is obviously also true of the re-emergence of the Johnny English franchise, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and returned in 2011 with Johnny English's Reborn.
Could our own satire of our own nothingness be a new export opportunity for our country?
Anyway, the strange-eyed, rubber-faced Johnny English gets a second license to perform, which means his comedy work is aimed at non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
And he certainly has something about him, despite his ridiculous aspirations for the perfect glamour, a little bit of Clozy, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and the guy who contributed to the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, the Chariots of Fire.
It was originally based on the now-forgotten Atkinson International, a traveler and mystery man who appeared in a Barclaycard television commercial and produced a menu around the area.
There are a couple of good things about the last round of AI.
I love how Johnny English comes in a medieval canister and the rotor blades are all over his head.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown, but the humor is seen as weak and superfluous, because 007 and Mission: Impossible are often laced with comedic moments.
I think Johnny English's experience is not as interesting or as compelling as Atkinson's Bean style jokes.
The premise of the permanent display is to show that the UK has big problems today.
A cyber hacker broke into a top-secret network of British spies, exposing the identities of British agents working in various locations, and causing a scandal among the agents on duty (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon plays a minor role).
The arrogant and impatient Prime Minister, suffering from a loss of political prestige, is impatient: Emma Thompson does everything she can for the role of the quasi-Theresa May, but she cannot go beyond the script.
His intelligence advisers have reported that all the spies have been exposed, and he will now be forced to recall those who have resigned.
This is Johnny English, a low-life who teaches at a high school, but who teaches informal lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes here, too, because English offers a spy academy in the form of Rock School.
English returns to Whitehall for urgent instruction and rejoins the long-suffering Buff (who is again Ben Miller).
Buffy is a married man who is subordinate to the captain of a submarine, and Vicky Pepperdine is a funny hockey stick that's been used a little bit too much for nothing.
Batman and Robin, who are both adventurers, return to work in Her Majesty's Secret Service, and Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko, is also a beauty.
And then the Prime Minister, who thought he could solve Britain's computer problems, gets thrown into the wheelchair by Jason Volta, the evil one.
English and Buffy begin their own bizarre comedy odyssey: disguised as pirates, they set fire to a French restaurant; they break into Walt's luxury yacht and destroy it; English uses a virtual reality headset to explore Walt's house, and then unleashes a rampage around the house.
And all of this is done to make the final story line, but the overly noisy action is like children's television.
It's a middle world.
After reviewing other Johnny English films, I wondered if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that matched his talent.
Labour thinks it's too radical a plan for the British to work four days and get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party thinks that working four days a week for the British and getting paid for five days a week is too radical a plan.
It is reported that the party wants executives to give employees extra time off work due to the savings resulting from the revolution in artificial intelligence.
And he gave them their wages, three days' wages, and three days' rest.
According to the sources, the idea fits the party's economic agenda and its plan to turn the country in favour of the workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved at the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is seen as a move to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, and also in line with the overall production strategy of the party.
The first to support this idea was the Green Party, not the Labour Party, which adopted a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party's ambition is not yet fully established.
A representative of the Labour Party: The four-day workweek is not a party policy, it is not being considered by the party.
The shadow chancellor, John MacDonnell, devoted last week's Labour conference to predicting a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that the decision was made to restore the power of "neutral directors" and "speculators" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plan means that existing shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their shares, as the Labour Party may make "decisions" based on proposed illegal actions.
He also confirmed plans to incorporate the company's employees into the board of directors and create inclusive ownership funds, according to which employees would be able to receive a dividend of £500 per year on a 10% share of private sector capital.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy 60 Minutes  asked if the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case would change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh withdrew the decisive vote on his Supreme Court nomination less than a week later, and raised the question whether the bureau's decision could force Republican senators to support it.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find a reason to change their minds.
Kennedy preferred to present the game more openly than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course. I think so", Kennedy said.
I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh on the way to the trial.
And it came to pass after the judgment, that I spoke to him, saying, What hast thou done?
He was courageous, steadfast, and did not hesitate to act.
However, Graham seemed to have made a firm decision.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is clear and I need a strong case to convict him", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened at that time, but I do know this: Brett refused to admit it", Graham said in response to Christina Blazy Ford.
But even so, they could not prove what they said.
It has been 36 years since then.
And I didn't see any change.
What is the purpose of the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring influential celebrities dedicated to ending global poverty.
In celebration of the seventh anniversary of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will gather on the main square of Central Park to not only see the performances of celebrities like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the main goal of the event, which is to end global poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international human rights organization that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket, of course), listeners must volunteer, write a letter to a world leader, make a phone call, or perform a series of important tasks or tasks aimed at raising awareness about the goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, only 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is the real way to get people to play a free concert a commitment to call people to action, or is it just another example of collectivism, the belief that people can make a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
According to Global Citizen, the organization has organized more than 19 million events for various causes with the help of supporters since 2011.
They said the events will encourage world leaders to announce commitments and demands worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group reported on 390 commitments and announcements resulting from organized activities, and at least $10 billion of these were raised or spent.
The group estimates that the fund has directly impacted the lives of 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals of the project is to help children reach their full potential, and after collecting 4,700 tweets on behalf of Global Citizens, British investors and executives have pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help address food insecurity in the region.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, we can make a historic reference to the social injustice of poor nutrition,  said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman to a crowd in London in April 2018.
In addition, the organization says that more than 5,000 activities are being organized in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, and the government has announced funding for The Power of Nutrition, which will cover nearly 5 million women and children.
The question that is asked in the list of the PPPs on their website is: Why are we so sure that we will win the fight against poverty?
Global citizen said: It's going to be a long and difficult road  We may fall sometimes and we may fail sometimes.
But like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we can succeed because we are stronger when we work together.
This year, New York City will host a concert by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman, featuring Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Moné.
US will seek help from the Navy to prevent Russian energy exports , said the Minister of Internal Affairs
US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has said that Washington will use the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia's intervention in Syria, including acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is the beginning of the exploration of a new energy market.
"I believe that their intention to act in the Middle East was born out of the need to find an energy broker, as in the case of Eastern Europe and the southern belt of Europe", he said in his speech.
In addition, the official said that there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the ability to do this with the help of the Navy, which is to open up sea routes, or, if necessary, block access to the Russian energy market", he said.
Zinke was speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that bills itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He then compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, which he said was essentially the same.
The economic issue with regard to Russia and Iran is not about fuel efficiency and fuel replacement, he said, describing Russia as a transportation country with limited economic dependence on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has been reported to have emphasized Russia's goal of accelerating the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and selling it to European consumers at a lower price.
That's why officials in the Trump administration, and even US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to abandon a pipe project like Nord Stream 2, which Trump believes would make Berlin a "captive" for Moscow.
Moscow, in turn, has proved that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $ 11 billion, which will double the capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin has stated that Washington's opposition to the project is based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am convinced that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers have the right to choose producers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany opposed this position of the United States, which in turn confirmed its unwavering position on the project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has asked the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"The interference of a third party in our energy supply process is a big inconvenience for us", Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren has announced that she will take control of the 2020 presidential race, according to a Massachusetts senator.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced that she would be taking control of the presidential race in the midterm elections.
During a rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren announced his intention to run.
According to Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and it's important that we have a woman at the head of the state".
 After November 6th , I will take strict control of my candidacy for the presidency.
During the town hall, Warren criticized President Donald Trump for "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am really disturbed by Donald Trump's actions towards our democracy", he said.
Warren has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
The poll was released on Thursday, although it was revealed that Warren's majority of his constituents were against his running in 2020.
A recent poll by the Center for Political Studies at Suffolk University/Boston Globe found that 58 percent of Massachusetts voters were unconvinced that the senator was a candidate for the presidency.
Thirty-two percent wanted him to run.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy had the most support, with 38% of voters favoring his candidacy, compared to 48% against.
As for the other top Democratic figures in the 2020 election, it's important to mention Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Biden's official decision will be known by January.
Sarah Palin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin during the presidential campaign of Donald Trump
The 26-year-old, who was drafted into the Army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
She was arrested on Monday for domestic violence.
"I can talk about what my son is going through and other families who are going through the effects of PTSD and other military injuries", she said at a rally outside Donald in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin likened her detention to the elephant in the room and asked if her son and other veterans had changed a little bit, and if there was any tribute to their fellow soldiers and pilots, to the troops of any other country that gave their country.
According to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states, District of Columbia, support the dispute over new housing policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a new U.S. law that bans shelter for victims of gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. on Friday in Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit to support an asylum seeker who opposed the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the appellant in the August complaint against federal law by the American Civil Liberties Union, Grace  Session, was not released.
She said that her partner and gang members abused her, but on July 20, officials refused to give her shelter.
He was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors who supported Grace described countries like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as having the highest number of asylum applications to the United States, with gangs and domestic violence being prevalent.
A new US policy in 2014 reversed the Immigration Appeals Board's decision to allow immigrants who had experienced domestic violence to apply for asylum without documentation.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia said in a statement that the new policy "reverses the annual state, federal and international laws that have been enacted".
"Federal law requires that all applications for housing be considered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the complaint, and such a ban violates this principle", the assistant judge said.
Prosecutors say the policy of barring immigrants from entering the country has a negative impact on the U.S. economy because they are often entrepreneurs who provide the labor force they need.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has banned immigration courts from offering shelter to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
Asylum is granted to those who have left their home country due to persecution or fear of persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,  said Sessions in a statement on June 11.
The refuge is not dedicated to solving all the problems that occur in the world every day, including the most difficult ones.
Rescue efforts in Palu remain difficult, and the number of dead found during the search for survivors is twice as high as the number of victims.
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly difficult.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is caring for her fever-stricken child in an evacuation center in Kiragan Palu, said: "It is very difficult.
The ambulance is bringing people every minute.
Clean water is not available.
People are returning to their broken homes, digging up the mud, trying to save whatever they can.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5-magnitude quake, and hospitals were filled.
One of the injured, with a broken back and shoulder, was placed near the Dwy Harris Palouse Military Hospital, where patients were treated under the open sky after a severe shock.
And he wept, and his eyes widened, when he remembered that the fifth floor of the house where he was, and his wife and his daughter, had been shaken.
We didn't defend ourselves.
"I felt like I was walking into a broken wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a party.
I heard my wife crying for help, then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my son.
I hope they are safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of propaganda
After the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the American daily that described mutually beneficial trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday pushed ahead with a paid supplement to China Daily in the best-selling Des Moines Register newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, but China has not acknowledged this.
Trump's accusation of Beijing interfering in the US election is a new phase in Trump's increased pressure on China, according to US officials who told Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to improve trade, Beijing and Washington are currently intensifying their trade war and as a result are imposing the same tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say the Chinese response targets exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, who was the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, believes that Beijing has done damage to American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said that China is now "aggravating the situation" by advertising in our free press.
"In spreading the message, the Chinese government is using American traditions of free speech and freedom of the press by giving Des Moines Register paid advertising", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you see a limited amount of opposition in Beijing and you don't see a true picture of the various opinions about China's difficult economic trajectory, and you have to remember that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
He also said that one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish it, but he did not say which newspaper.
Experts warn that Kavano has alienated women voters ahead of the midterm
With Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh being supported and defended by many Republicans in high office, experts say the upcoming midterm elections will be particularly backed by women.
It was too emotional and many Republicans were already saying they wanted to win the election.
And that's not going to happen again", says Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Richer expressed his uncertainty that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute attempt to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday, today, tomorrow, or November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn.
According to the Mic, after Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite a statement from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a group of protesters in the Senate corridors chanted "Black approaches" on Friday morning.
And the nonpartisan political scientist Stu Rothenberg said on a news website that "democratic enthusiasm and motivation is off the table".
People say it's too high, and it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women and people 18 to 29 years old who live in the suburbs and don't vote even though they don't like the president".
Prior to Ford's full public statement of his allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, experts had predicted a backlash if further confirmation was forthcoming.
NBC News reported that former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week that "it's a dead end for the Republican Party".
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench, it's also about how Republicans decide and how they look at it", said Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic election-aid group Priorities USA.
But the American people seem to be divided over who Ford or Kavanaugh believes.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents thought Ford's words were either true or likely to be true, and 35 percent thought Kavanaugh's words were either true or likely to be true.
And 38% of respondents thought Kavanagh lied while answering, compared to 30% who thought Ford lied.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is considering at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, in addition to Ford's allegations, following Flake's statement.
Last week, Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had assaulted her when he was 17 years old, drunk.
Ramirez was a student at Yale in the 1980s when, at a party, a Supreme Court nominee told her he had shown her his penis.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can see what information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is global dominance.
"We need to do this now", he said of the startup.
 This  is a historic moment
The application uses Solid technology, which helps people create their own personal online data storage (or POD).
It can contain a list of contacts, a to-do list, a calendar, a music collection, and other personal, professional tools.
It's all accessible from the same browser at the same time, like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
The peculiarity of the storage of personal data is that it depends on the user who can use some information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to make Solid accessible to everyone, by providing all the resources, processes and skills the company needs to make it accessible.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform acquired by IBM, several full-time developers and a community of volunteer programmers who have been contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using tools from Inrupt.
Berners-Lee says he and his team have not talked to Facebook or Google about whether or not to implement a full update that would completely revamp all business models in an hour.
We don 't ask them for their permission.
In an article published on Medium on Sunday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt  is to provide commercial power and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet at MIT by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over net neutrality.
While creating Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm a great believer in the next era of the Internet", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest of the First World War awarded with the Victoria Chair
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was awarded the Victoria Cross 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Bernard Vann captured Bellenglish and Leucore on 29 September 1918 during the attack.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
The memorial was dedicated by his two grandsons at a march from Rushden in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that his father's stone was found 100 years after he was awarded the prize, and it was full of symbols.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Cole Vann led his battalion through the St. Cant's Channel in a thick fog and under the fire of shotguns and machine guns.
Then he runs to the battle line and leads it forward with great courage, before he ran to the battlefield with one hand and destroyed three troops.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says he never knew he could do what his father did.
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, he and his brother Dr. James Vann laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said he was very proud to be part of the campaign and that the hero's heroism was expressed by the support of many people.
Fans of MMA were surprised to see that instead of Bellato , Peppa was shown
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, which was presented in a package, but instead Peppa was shown a tower.
The San Jose account consisted of 13 matches, six of which were part of the main package and were broadcast live all night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6am, as Geoghegan Musasi and Rory McDonald prepare to meet, UK viewers switch to Peppa Pig.
The audience, who stayed up late to watch the fight, didn't like it.
One fan tweeted that it was a joke to change it to a children's cartoon.
When asked about the program, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, replied that the content did not comply with the government's decision and they had to switch to a children's program at 6 p.m.
 This is a match to Peppa.
The president of Bellator says they are planning to expand to the UK in the future.
"I think we can sort this out when we think about re-playing", Cocker said.
But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't discuss it until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on this.
When he was replaced, there were various complaints.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical failure.
But it didn't, it was a state issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights, not six, and we're going to try to get it to the fans, and we're going to do it.
This failed.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete didn't realize that everyone was different from her until she was in high school.
In a talk on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
She also said that she was less distracted by winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The longtime regular host of the show had taken a leave of absence due to illness.
As the main guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said that she felt inferior to other teenagers because it was not accepted by society as a relationship between boys and girls.
He said that feeling really inferior and different was the driving force behind his success.
She wanted to prove herself, because she didn't want to disappoint others when they found out about her sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and called for homosexuality not to be considered a crime at the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said that he did so to show that he had a way to live openly, so that he could not be persecuted, and to give hope to others.
She was so moved by the love affair with a man, a three-time world champion, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior, but she says the age difference has never been a problem.
"After a lot of things you've been through in your youth, it's hard to find a peer who has had such highs and lows", she says.
The couple became parents in June, naming their son Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley says his "perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me anything last year, I would only tell you about the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold.
For me , the Olympic gold medal is Robby .
Her baby was named after her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly's father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he wanted was a ticket to the 2012 London Olympics, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't sit in the front row with my father.
"I held his hand until he breathed his last, and only when his breath was cut off and he died did I recognize him as a victor who will never be defeated".
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"Diving in my own arena during the Olympics, I realized that this was the moment I had always wanted to do, and I had never felt this before", she said.
And that's what led to her choosing her first song,  Proud by Heather Small, which was a song that touched her heart as she was preparing for the Olympics, and it still touches her when she listens to it.
The Disappearing Islands discs are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 AM.
Mickelson without form on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will play his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, setting a new record, but he needs to change his form to avoid a disaster.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in the biennial tournament and set a record, replaced captain Jim Furyk with four goals and four assists on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the story as in the United States, the five-time major winner spent this important day as a fan and working on his game on the range to correct the flaws that bothered him.
The 48-year-old, who had never competed directly at the peak of his career, was not very flexible on the tough track of Le Golf National, where the long and tough support itself was a challenge.
And if their pace isn't too scary, Mickelson will be in his ninth match on Sunday, teaming up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to face British Open defending champion Francesco Molinari for their four-game win streak this week.
If the Americans, who lost by four points in 12 singles matches, start the game strongly, then Mickelson's match could be the decisive game.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, and said nothing else.
"He understood his role today, and he patted me on the back, hugged me and said ... he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He is too confident.
He's a Hall of Famer who has contributed significantly to these teams' game earlier this week.
Maybe I didn't expect him to play two full matches.
I thought about it a lot, but that's the way it's designed, so we thought we should keep it that way.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk says his participation has made significant changes to the team.
"He was a funny guy, sarcastic, intelligent, liked to make fun of people, and he was the perfect guy for our team", she said.
I think it was fun for the young players to play with him this week, and we watched him.
He has more to offer than just a game".
European captain Thomas Bjorn believes that the dominance among participants may soon be eliminated
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew that a crucial lead in a Ryder Cup individual event could very well turn into a bad trip.
The Danish athlete started his career in the same match in Valderram in 1997, and this time, the side led by Sev Ballesteros beat the Americans by five points and crossed the finish line with a single-headed head, winning the match with a score of 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You're going to say we had a great opportunity in Walderram, but we had a great opportunity in Brooklyn, but we won and we won fairly in Walderram", Bjorn said when the Class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
This is not the end.
You leave tomorrow.
Do everything properly.
It's not over until your score is on the board.
Our goal is to try to capture this prey, and that's what we're going to focus on.
I used to say that I was focused on my 12 players, but as we all know, the opponents are the best players in the world".
Bjorn, who was impressed by his players' performance on the rough court, said: "I would never have pushed myself.
Tomorrow's game is up to tomorrow.
Tomorrow, the players will go out individually and it will be different.
It's nice to have a partner to share your joy when the game is going well, but when you're alone, you're trying to do everything.
This is my message to the players: don't wait until you can do everything you can in the game tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he's trying to do his best".
Compared to Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the number one opponent, would look for players who performed better in individual games than in partner games, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four games.
Furyk was on both ends of the big spins of this final day and played as part of the winning team in Brooklyn until his defeat in the Miracle at Medina, a European-hosted game.
"I still remember every damn word that was said about it", he said in response to a question about how captain Ben Crenshaw put the players' heads together on his final day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start this as fast as we saw in Brooklyn, Medina.
The one-way momentum shift would put a lot of pressure on the inter-match.
With that in mind, we changed the lineup and we think we can do something amazing tomorrow".
It's Thomas's job to try to control this fight, and he's going to face Rory McIlwra in a top-flight match against Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went out with these guys in this order because I think they can completely circle the track in this order", Björn said during the individual selection.
New German warship delayed again
The latest type of frigates of the German Navy were commissioned in 2014 to replace the nearly-worn warships used during the Cold War, however, according to local media, they will not be delivered until at least the following year due to faulty systems and delivery costs.
The commissioning of the main ship of the new water frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, Rheinland-Pfalz, was postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be delivered to the fleet in 2014, however, dangerous problems arose after the ship was delivered, which contributed to the fate of the high-end project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to have powerful warheads, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and invisible technologies such as miniaturized radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include the possibility of providing the last type of frigates dispatched from inland ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships that are supposed to allow Germany to project electricity abroad will become obsolete before they are put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The failure of the F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
The Navy has never before returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There is no definitive information on the reasons for the ship's withdrawal, however, the German media reported a number of significant "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship unusable during combat missions.
The software flaws were significant because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships were equipped with a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the size of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be overweight, meaning that the excess weight would reduce the ship's performance and limit the Navy's ability to make further improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate was twice as heavy as the similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the equipment failure, the total cost of the project, including the cost of training the team, is also a controversial issue.
He said that it has reached an astonishing level, from the initial 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
The question of acquiring new frigates is of great importance today, after warnings about the reduction of the German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary committee on defence, said that the number of "fit ships" for the German navy was "close to exhaustion".
The official said the issue was further complicated by the fact that the old ships were being taken out of service and the replacement ships were not being delivered.
He was upset that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates had yet been delivered to the fleet.
National Trust to listen to advertisers ' private lives in secret
New research on land ownership in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at showing how frogs use the landscape to find food.
We hope that this information will help us to look at the behavior of these separately flying mammals in a new way and help us to protect them in the future.
Research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) will continue to study the common and soprano pipistrello, as well as the brown long-bearded sparrows and the Daubenton sparrows in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registers will be installed on the territory of the hotel to monitor the activities of advertisements throughout the term .
In addition, NHS staff and volunteers will be able to scan mobile phones using handheld detectors.
An expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls to the ads and what type of ads they are.
Then a map of their habitat and a calculation are made to provide detailed information about their activity in the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, said he hopes the study results will show which habitats are suitable for the bats and how they use them.
This information can help to determine the effectiveness of activities that are being done to monitor the habitat, such as the way in which the forest is being landscaped and maintained for the care of forest tiles for frogs and similar animals.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined dramatically over the last hundred years.
Construction and development work has hindered their survival and threatened to destroy their habitat.
They may also be at risk from wind turbines and lighting, chemical processing of adhesives and building materials, and attacks by house cats.
The truth is, frogs are not blind.
However, when it comes to finding prey, hearing is more important to them than sight to hunt in the dark.
During flight, they use sophisticated echolocation techniques to accurately identify hazards and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the issue of publications very seriously.
There are ten experts who are specially trained and who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the area and sometimes even rescue.
The organization even established a special fund for the Scottish crows at Treve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten Scottish crows.
According to real estate manager David Thompson, this property is a great place to advertise.
"Here in Trevet, there are some great places to advertise", he said.
"We have old buildings, many veterans, and a very good environment.
But there's still a lot of unknowns about the bugs, so the work that's being done in these and other areas will help us better understand what we need to do to replicate them".
He noted the importance of checking for frogs in the area before starting the repair work in the buildings, because the negligent destruction of one nest can affect about 400 female frogs and chicks that make up the local population.
The frogs are protected and killing, touching or breaking their nests is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer from the Defence of the Realm, called for help.
He said, "We don't know much about our ads, and we don't know anything about the populations of some of them".
Ronaldo was denied a rape charge because his lawyers were going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", and said people are using his name to "get their names out".
Her lawyers plan to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
In order to keep the incident a secret, he paid her $375,000, Der Spiegel said in a statement on Friday.
A few hours after receiving the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram video he shared with 142 million followers that the message was "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no, this is not a game.
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner said: "Their words today are false.
"They want to make a name for themselves using my name.
This is normal.
And they seek to make themselves famous by calling me by name, and that is their business.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine", the player replied with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they describe as "unforgivable reporting on suspicion of privacy".
Defence official Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation "in proportion to the amount of moral damage caused by this, which has become one of the most severe forms of personal rights violations in recent years".
According to the report, the incident occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Documents filed in Clark District Court in Nevada show that after a meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her.
Majorga said that after the event, Ronaldo knelt down and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and only "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo said the couple had consensual sex.
According to the mayor, he reported to the police and photographed the injuries he received in the hospital, but later decided to settle the matter out of court, fearing "shyness" and "public humiliation".
34-year-old woman is believed to be still suffering from the incident, so she refuses to stay in one place.
The incident is believed to have happened when Ronaldo was in the process of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he signed a €100 million deal with Italian giants Juventus.
Brexit: UK will regret for life the loss of car manufacturers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that if Britain loses its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, it would "regret it for the rest of its life".
He called it a "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily shut down its Bernaston plant near Derby if the UK left the EU without a contract.
"We need to sign a contract", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border caused by Brexit inaction could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, and 90% of them were exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a production shutdown at our plant", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's chief executive in the Burnaston area.
Other UK carmakers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade services.
For example, BMW announced that it would close its mini factory in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The carmakers say the main risk is the supply chain, which is not related to Brexit.
Toyota's production line is "on time" and custom car parts are delivered every 37 minutes with the help of UK and EU suppliers.
According to experts, if the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be delays at the border and shortages of auto parts.
The company claims that Toyota can only store its stock in its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and that is why production has stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the European Union was "very well designed to prevent similar border checks".
"We need to get a contract, and I think we need a better contract that not only makes us successful at the moment, but also makes us more productive", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers have been certified  to continue the trend that has been a very successful set of supply chains so far".
Toyota did not say how long production would be halted, but warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness in the future and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who worked at Bernaston for 24 years and was a member of the Unite union at the plant, expressed the concern of all union members: "I have seen from my own experience that once these jobs are closed, they don't reopen.
The representative of the Government said: "We have presented a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union".
White House says Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed for another week" as Brett Kavanaugh's fight for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein will oversee the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who deals with issues including Russian election interference, the relationship between Trump and Russian aides, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump should fire the deputy attorney general and thus threaten Mueller's independence has been the subject of much debate in Washington over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein suggested using a recording network to record their conversations during a meeting with Trump, and he talked about the possibility of impeaching the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused to confirm this.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House and announced his resignation.
As a result, Trump's meeting with Trump was postponed to Thursday due to his trip to the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't want to fire Rosenstein", but the meeting was postponed again to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was due to hear testimony from Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the Kavanaugh case, delaying a Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "The date is unknown, it could be this week, and I would like to speculate that it could be another week, given other developments in the Supreme Court.
We'll see about that again, but I want the press to know about it".
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
And the driver, Chris Wallace, asked me why.
Sanders said the reason why the press conference is so rarely organized is not because of the "special appearance" of the television community, but he said, "I have no objection to them taking the podium".
He then suggested that there should be a direct link between Trump and the press.
"The president has a relatively higher number of question and answer sessions than any of his predecessors", he said, without providing specific evidence, "and we've looked at the data".
Sanders said the press conferences would continue as usual, but that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a direct question, it's certainly more important than talking to me.
"We're trying to do this more often, and you can see how we've been doing it over the last few weeks, and your conversation with the president of the United States could be a replacement for a press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions during open sessions and press conferences for senior officials as he leaves the White House.
Special press conferences are rarely organized.
This week in New York, the president was able to explain to a gathering of reporters why he was so neutral and sometimes so different.
Health Minister warns EU workers in Scotland about Brexit
The Minister of Health thanked EU workers in Scotland on behalf of the country and wished them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent this letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has assumed the costs of the applications for settlement of EU citizens in the public service.
Ms. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations on the separation between the UK and the EU have been going on all summer and are close to a final decision by autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a no-contract scenario.
I understand that this is a difficult time for you.
I would like to reiterate that I appreciate the work of every worker and do not discriminate on the basis of nationality.
Our partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that improve and develop healthcare, and benefit patients and the organisations we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay here".
Christie Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery due to head injury
Mike Organ of Tennessee announced that Tennessee Tigers quarterback Christie Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery for a head injury sustained in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident occurred just before halftime.
"He went out to the outskirts and there he passed out", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff put Abercrombie in a cage and gave him extra oxygen at the edge of the field before taking him for a check-up.
Chris Harris, a WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, official, said Abercrombie had just come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"We don't have any information on the extent of the injury yet", Harris added, and Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
It was Abercrombie's first season as a redshirt sophomore since moving from Illinois to Tennessee.
By the time he retired on Saturday, he had made five complete catches, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will pay more flagship fee if they buy real estate on the territory of the PR
Foreign buyers will pay more flagship fee if they buy real estate on the territory of the country , and the proceeds will be used to help homeless people under the Tori plan
This move will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voters.
The increased flag fee will be levied on individuals and organizations that do not pay taxes on the territory of the United Kingdom.
The result of this decision is expected to bring to the Treasury up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May said that foreign buyers will pay more flag tax if they buy property in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help homeless people.
This move is an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promoting affordable housing and higher wages.
The increased flag fee will be levied on individuals and organisations who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to support the Government's work to combat insomnia.
The amount of the surcharge added to the current flag levy shall not be less than three percent after two years of high level tax and customs duties .
The decision is expected to bring in up to £120 million a year to the Treasury.
The data shows that 13% of all properties in London are owned by non-British buyers, and this is driving up prices, making it less likely that new buyers will move up the housing ladder.
Many potential areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "suburbs" due to the increasing number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was born just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the flag tax to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused big construction firms of not allowing real estate prices to fall by owning land but not using it, and called on Mrs May to abandon the affordable housing quota to end Britain's "housing scandal".
Mr. Corbyn announced that he had proposed several attractive housing reforms, including controlling rental costs and eliminating evictions without cause.
He also said that he wanted to give the delegation more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to the British dream, to improving the lives of future generations.
This means that we have to fix our broken housing market.
The door to Britain is always open to anyone who wants to live, work and live here.
But I think it's not fair that non-UK residents and foreign companies have easier access to housing than hardworking British people.
For many people, having access to housing is an impossible dream, and sleep deprivation is becoming too real".
Jack Ross said , " My ultimate goal is to run Scotland . "
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "main goal" was to be appointed Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoyed a revival with the north-eastern club, who finished third in the Premier League with a three-point margin.
After sending Saint-Mirin to the Premier League last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap, and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my dad, and that's what made me come back.
If I manage the club well, I will have that opportunity".
Ross was preceded as Sunderland manager by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyetta and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic, who had previously not taken over for Barnsley and Ipswich Town, was not concerned that he would continue to follow in the footsteps of such a great club.
"The question of whether I can get the club back to the Premier League will determine whether I'm successful right now".
He said that the structure of the club and the facilities there are definitely part of the Premier League.
"It's not easy to get into it, but if I can give the club back to him, I think I can see where I can be successful".
Ross began his managerial career just three years ago after working as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and then as a member of the coaching staff at Hartz for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa to promotion back to the third tier, and led the exiting St Mirren to the championship in the following season.
Ross said he felt more comfortable playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He said that he felt like he was really on the path to taking responsibility for Alloa.
"I really thought that the conductor was more compatible with me than I was with myself.
And that sounds strange, because I was doing a good job, I was getting good money, and I was getting significantly better results.
But playing can be difficult.
We have to close some cases in a week.
I'm going through the hard parts of the job, but the management side is still young.
I've always wanted to be a leader, and I feel like I've found the most comfortable place in my adult life".

Studies show that the best time to buy a pint is Saturday at 5:30.
The summer heat was good for the British pubs that were competing, but it was bad for the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but orders in restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA who produced the figures, said: "The warm weather and England's longer than expected World Cup attendance means that July will be a repeat of June, when pubs were up 2.8 percent and restaurants were losing even more.
The situation of restaurants, which have seen their revenues fall by 1.8 percent in the season, will be worse than before.
In comparison with restaurants, bars and pubs that serve drinks are more popular.
Pubs that serve food also suffer a lot in hot weather, but not as badly as restaurants.
It is as if people go out of their houses only to drink water.
While pubs and bars saw a 6.6 percent increase in sales in the same month, food sales fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, entertainment and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend from April.
When it comes to outdoor sales, weather and the impact of social or sporting events remain the biggest factors.
The restaurant groups will certainly continue to struggle, but a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales, especially due to price pressures, will be a major blow.
The long hot summer has turned into the worst time for the food industry, and time will tell if the average August temperatures can be a little bit of a relief".
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, increased by 2.7% in July, which slowed the emergence of brands.
For the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector, Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales monitoring service, collects and analyses data on the output of 47 operating groups with a total turnover of £9 billion and is recognised as an industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a social network account hidden from their parents
Studies show that one in five children (some as young as 11) have a secret social networking account that they keep hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of fake Insta pages increased
There is a strong suspicion that sexual content is being recorded
Twenty percent of students have a basic account to show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students found that "fake Insta" pages increased the number of Instagram photos shared.
There is a strong suspicion that sexual content is being made.
Twenty percent of students have a basic account that they can show their parents, and they also keep confidential accounts.
A mother who saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret behavior saw a teenager begging others to rape her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, keeping one of them private.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said, "It's very worrying that teenagers are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find".
Elid Doyle to be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Athletics Council
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eileen Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council.
Doyle , the most decorated athlete and chairman, Ian Beatty, described the move as a great opportunity for the sports board to use its rich experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and global community and we think Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from her appointment to the board", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to help develop and guide the sport in Scotland".
Among the four Olympic gold medals, the winner of the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, now a BBC scientist, was an American citizen who was paralyzed after an ischemic attack.
He tweeted, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would be fit or not, or how fit I would be.
It took a lot of hard work, but I got back into shape, I learned to walk again, and today I'm practicing my agility!
Thank you for your support!"
Comparing women to cows in a breast pump advertisement has caused controversy
An advertisement by a breast pump company that compared nursing mothers to breastfeeding cows caused a stir online.
Consumer technology company Elvie has released a bizarre promotional video to promote what it calls the world's first wearable silent breastplate to showcase the freedom mothers have.
In a cage full of grass, four mothers sing the words, "Yes, I heal myself, but I don't have a tail", and "If you can't see that it's not the wind, it's my breasts".
And the chorus continues: "I will pluck up, pluck up, I will feed the children, I will heal the women".
However, the company's Facebook ad sparked controversy online.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, has received mixed reviews from viewers, many of whom said it exposes the dairy industry's shame.
"It was a very bad decision to use a cow to promote this product.
They too are pregnant, they give birth, they give birth, but after a few days they take their children away.
Elvie breast pump is not detected inside the chest (Elvie / Mother)
Another view is that "it is obvious that it is harmful to both mother and child.
But why not use it to advertise the breast pump to mothers who want to hold their babies?"
Another commented, "It's not really a commercial".
While others were supporting the ad, one woman found the song amusing.
I think it's a great idea.
If I was breastfeeding, I would have one of these.
I used a vacuum cleaner and felt like a cow.
The ad was a little silly, but I took it as it was.
This is a unique product.
Another commented: This funny ad is for mothers who use a breast pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and those who feel like serious.
This is not an advertisement to exalt or degrade the status of dairy farming .
Towards the end of the video, you see a group of women dancing with suckers that are threaded under their breasts.
The concept behind this ad is based on the idea that many women who use a vacuum will feel like cows.
But the Elvish suckler is silent, has no wires or tubes, and shines through the breast without being noticeable, allowing women to move freely, hold the baby, and even go out into the field while suckling.
Our colleague and early childhood development expert Ana Balarin said that the Elvi suction cup was such a revolutionary product that it deserved to be bold and thought-provoking to bring it to market.
By showing women and dairy cows, and by showing parallels between them, we wanted to show the amazing freedom that the new suckler offers in a refreshing and comparative way, and to draw attention to the challenges of using the suckler and the challenges that come with it.
This is not the first time that Elvie's milkshake has been the subject of a news story.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two was on the podium when she used this product in a fashion show by designer Martha Yakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved from tents on the Texas border to camps set up by the government.
While the monthly number of children crossing the border hasn't changed much, the number of migrant children being detained has increased dramatically, because at times, the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are undocumented immigrants who don't want to be seen as a threat to their ability to stay in their country by claiming a child.
The threat was raised in June when the Federal Administration announced that fingerprints of potential sponsors and other minor citizens living in their homes are required to be submitted and that the data will be sent to the Migration Administration.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress about dozens of people the agency has arrested for filing applications for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreigners involved in crime.
We will continue to persecute these people", Mr. Albenz said.
To speed up work with children, the authorities introduced new rules, which, according to camp workers, require people to appear in court within a month after some of their detentions, not 60 days as was the norm.
Instead of face-to-face meetings, the public will be able to make their applications to the immigration judge via videoconference.
Anyone deemed unworthy of assistance is immediately deported from the country.
According to camp workers and reports in the system in recent months, the longer children stay in shelters, the more likely they are to become disturbed and depressed, which can lead to further violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are more likely to occur in large institutions like Tornillo, because the suffering of children in such a large space can be ignored.
They said that moving children to a tent city without emotional preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends can cause psychological damage that many people cannot repair.
Syria wants US, French and Turkish invaders to leave immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the eight-year war in the country.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Muallem, the illegal presence of foreign troops in Syria under the pretext of the war on terrorism will be dealt with appropriately.
"They should leave the country immediately, under any circumstances", he told the assembly.
The minister stressed that the war on terrorism in Syria, where 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011, is over.
He said that Damascus would not stop this holy battle until it cleansed the entire Syrian territory of any illegal foreign invasion, including terrorist groups.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who train and train mostly Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the situation is favorable for their return, and that the reason why refugees are leaving the country is because some Western countries are spreading irrational fear.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to the return of refugees", he said.
They turned a purely social issue into a political one.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be provided to rebuild Syria unless an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed for the resumption of political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area of three million people.
Muallem also emphasized that the agreement has a specific timeline and hopes that military action will be directed towards the destruction of jihadists, including the Nusra Front, which has ties to al-Qaeda.
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and open the way for elections in Syria.
Muallem created the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee's work, warning that the working group should limit itself to revising the current constitution, and not go further.
Why does Trump win a second term?
By this logic, Mr. Trump could have been re-elected in 2020 if his presidency had not ended prematurely due to impeachment and controversy, as many liberal observers had hoped.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of the presidential mandate ever.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million, and tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Nielsen said Fox News had 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to an average of 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show outperformed cable networks with 3.5 million viewers watching the prime time evening news.
"It's a fire that people are reaching for without seeing it, and we can't understand it", says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama The Exterminated Savior, about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in the attack.
Nell Scovell is a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just Funny Parties: And Another Bitter Truth About Getting Involved with Hollywood Kids".
He remembered driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Ms. Squall said.
There is a sense of fun in chaos.
Of course, more than anything else on television, the network of Washington-based talk shows could have determined the fate of Roe v. Wade, the reunification of immigrant families, and the impact of this on the state of the global economy.
Only those with special privileges can delete it.
For six hours, Bob Woodward discussed the foundation of fear in his book Fear, watched Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (which the Washington Post called a "thick-skinned suit"), and learned about Stormy Daniels's brutal description of Trump's anatomy, which went beyond being a citizen with information.
I can't look at Super Mario anymore, under any circumstances.
"The fact that what he's doing is a reality show, in some cases, is that he's showing you something different every night", said Brent Montgomery, head of the Wilhowe Entertainment Center and author of "Bad Stars" about the Trump program's people and daily plot changes (e.g., picking a fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I called Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was sitting in his hole watching MSNBC and copying CNN.
Even though Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance, he couldn't control himself.
I remember when we were doing these demonic programs years ago, people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.

The money flows from abroad are poured into the White House's tight election policies at the height of its momentum.
With congressional redistricting, it's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th District is getting some financial aid, as there are two candidates in the race for a seat.
The recently rebuilt suburbs of Pittsburgh will no doubt be a challenge to Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special district last spring.
Lamb is in a dispute with Republican incumbent Kate Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District, which is now part of Pennsylvania's new 17th District.
When the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old territory had been unconstitutionally taken by the Republicans, the maps were rebuilt.
The race in the new 17th district, the main Democratic Campaign Committee (CCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (RNC) caused a decline in funding among the party's funding groups.
After a small, widely-watched special election victory in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March, Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won it by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
US sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China later relaxed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing with little opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera and owned a hotel in Panama before colleagues evicted the Trump Organization management team.
In accordance with the ruling that Taiwan is no longer a state, State Department officials have decided to deport American diplomatic officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, State Department press secretary Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the fines were only applied to El Salvador, which received US$140 million in 2017 in aid to curb drug use, develop the country and support its economy.
The proposed fines, cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions will certainly have a severe impact on the Central American country, which has high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings progressed, leaders from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was hailed as a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior leaders had expressed their full support for the conference being held earlier, and as a result, they wanted sanctions on El Salvador to be lifted.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence intends to discuss the seats in the Administrative Assembly at a meeting in mid-October.
The three American ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on details of the discussions described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, and they settled on an anonymous discussion.
Their account was confirmed by an external expert close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Search the history
The next step is probably a report by a special counsel, Robert Mueller, on Trump's obstruction of justice, which has substantial evidence that has now been released.
Mr. Mueller reportedly turned his research to the possibility of a collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence our election.
If Congress goes from one hand to another, Mr. Trump is accountable to that organization because he's prepared to go back to the electorate, and he's going to go to the House of Lords.
There are a lot of "ifs" here, but I'm not saying that the Europeans will definitely lose to Trump or his kind.
The choices we make on both sides of the Atlantic will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, when the West resisted Hitler and supported the Czechoslovak forces in Munich, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler.
We missed the opportunity to save lives and prevent years of bloodshed.
History moves around these points of change, and the relentless march of democracy is either revived or reversed.
Americans are currently experiencing some of these tipping points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who is in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Last year, Rosenstein was in a tough spot after the same newspaper offered to secretly videotape the president and announced that he was unfit for the presidency.
Rosenstein said that the information provided by The Times was not accurate.
If the newly appointed FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if the Supreme Court upholds it despite evidence of sexual assault and perjury, how do we respond?
And first of all, in the midterm elections, will we vote for Congress to hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will be dormant for a long time.
But I hope that we will not be discouraged by what happened in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had invaded my embassy.

Ranger Graham Dorrance is optimistic about the conflict in Vienna.
Rangers received Vienna on Thursday, and after a great game against Villarreal earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will cement their place in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Doran was unable to play for the first time this season until the score was 2-2 against Villarreal, but he said he hoped the Rangers would use this as a springboard to great success.
"It was a good experience for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game confident that we would not lose and we brought a point".
I think the result was fair, even if we broke the rules of the game in the end.
They played better in the first half, but we seemed to be better in the second half.
As for Thursday, it is a big night for Europe.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be tough for us because they did so well in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans who believe in us, we'll go forward and do well.
Last year was definitely a difficult one for me, due to my injury and the changes that have taken place at the club, but I also want to mention the factor that makes me feel good here.
The team is in good shape, the boys are getting positive results, and the training is going well.
I hope we can move on from the past and make progress.
Women lose sleep from fears about pension savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to family members about it.
Nearly half of the people surveyed nationwide said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Industry, "People want to care for their family members, but they're not taking the steps to talk to each other about it".
And that's where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you without first talking to them about your preferences.
It's important to talk to your counselor and your family about where and how to get care, because these decisions are important factors in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor may find a way to make payments.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help cover the costs, or self-insurance if you have money.
Keep legal documents: To avoid legal disputes, discuss everything where you are going to file the documents.
Choose a healthcare professional wherever you go, in which case, someone you trust will assess your level of care and make sure that the professionals are doing what you want (if you can't speak).
Please note that a lawyer is also needed for financial matters.
When you are incapacitated, you need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions and pay your bills.
Remember the details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents has an emergency and is now in the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Make a plan for such information and make sure that you are ready.

A man who was returning home after a night camp was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The 40-year-old victim, Ilfaucomb, was in the Oxford Grove area of Devon when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at 02:30 BST, as a "time-sensitive act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening, and police turned to witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
This Friday, an earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo killed 384 people, and officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the loss of communication, the rescue services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala area north of the city of Palu, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palau.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, at the end of a wide bay, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along a coastline of over 300 km (180 mi) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The administrative district of the regency, located in the lower part of the province, had a population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but the industry is mainly concentrated in Morawa, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, in the last 100 years, tsunamis have hit Palo and Donggala several times.
The 1938 tsunami in Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami that struck western Donggala in 1996 killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active region called the "Ring of Fire of the Pacific" and is regularly subject to earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province, north of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, on December 26 caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the most populous island in southern Indonesia, Java, and moved southward, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the island of Metawai in Sumatra causes a 10-meter tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A low-level earthquake in the Pidi Jai Regency in Aceh causes devastation and panic among the population, as people were warned about the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were trapped under collapsed buildings and died.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented thousands of tourists from returning to their homes.
Sara Palin ' s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Trek Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, and resisted arrest for obstructing access to information about domestic violence, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police, the woman's friend tried to report the alleged crimes to the police, but she took her phone.
Palin was placed in Mat-Su's custody, KTUU reported, holding him on $500 unsecured bonds.
When he appeared in court on Saturday and demanded a confession, it was reported online that he had declared himself completely innocent.
Palin is charged with three Class A felonies, which carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report a possible assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans' Council.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, false information and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
She complained that her friend was punishing her and that she was hitting him in the face.
Sarah Palin has been criticized by the veterans' group for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in the military in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people died.
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami that killed thousands of cattle.
The number of deaths from power outages and communications outages is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake originated in the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that are trying to make an impact.
By the time the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in Palo.
Federal prosecutor seeks rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office is considering a rare death sentence for Saifolo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that has not been used in federal prosecutions in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, rented a truck from a warehouse in lower Manhattan along the West Side Highway to attack pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the use of the death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov had intentionally murdered eight victims and inflicted serious bodily harm in connection with a death penalty document from the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, the death penalty can be imposed on two points.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering, a charge typically applied by federal prosecutors to organized crime, rape and car theft.
Prosecutors described Saipov's criminal behavior as "disgusting, cruel and degrading" and stated that the terrorist act "required careful and premeditated planning".
"Saifulllo Habibulaevich Saipov has caused harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolasa Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariella Erlia, Ernana Ferrucci, Ernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco", the prosecution said in the indictment.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last death penalty case was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was handed down in 1953 to husband and wife Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were sentenced to death after being convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the terrorist act.
Police said he told investigators he felt better after what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit a terrorist act after seeing ISIS videos on his cell phone.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public defender who defends Saipov's interests, said he was "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that instead of a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole, the death penalty would prolong the suffering of everyone involved in this incident", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
A Tory spokesman said Nigel Farage should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilize the army during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should feel the heat coming from the Eurosceptics because one of the MPs, Theresa May, thought she should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Conservative agent Peter Bonn said at a march in Birmingham that if Brexit Secretary Mr Fraqui had been there, England would have left the EU by now.
But the issue that arose as Mrs May was graduating from her deeply divided viewpoint was that Tories were protesting against Brexit in the city in private.
The Prime Minister is doing everything she can to keep the peace plan going, and the attackers include those who want Brexit, those who want to stay in the EU and those who want the EU.
The union said it was trying to negotiate with Brussels despite the backlash and demanded that Eurosceptics and Labour make a choice between its plan and "chaos".
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.
He suggested that Faraj should be given some responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for this, we would not be in the union now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I am for Brexit, but we need to bring the Chequers under pressure".
In his opposition to the EU, he said: "We are not in the world wars now to be subordinate to anyone.
We want to have our own laws in our country.'
Mr. Bon has rejected proposals since 2016 that public opinion has changed: the idea that the British people want to change their minds and stay in the Union is completely false.
And the Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, telling reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Checkered voters are not popular among the majority, the opposition does not vote for them, after they have damaged our streets, they are not popular among our party and our activists who vote for us.
Put down your cheekbones and start listening.'
In a letter to Mrs. May, he added: "Prime Ministers can only keep their seats if they stand by their words.
Mr. Faraj said that politicians who opposed the 2016 referendum decision would be disappointed if they wanted to sell.
"Now it's about trust between the people and our political environment", he said.
They're trying to sell us Brexit, and we're here to tell them, 'We're not going to let you get away with this.'
In a message to a group of people, he added: "I want our political environment to feel warmly about betraying Brexit".
We will rally the people of this country that won us Brexit and we will not stop until Britain is an independent, self-governing, proud nation.
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay in the union were marching through Birmingham and holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After several activists launched the group this weekend, Tory took out banners against Brexit.
Lord Adoni, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservatives, reminding them of the security concerns raised at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who have developed their IT systems and say that all the technology is ready for Canada, and that there is a possibility of free trade in Ireland without borders", he said.
This is a very vulgar joke.
He added that there is nothing better than Brexit.
Warren plans to show moderate form in presidential bid
After the November election in the United States, Senator Elizabeth said she would consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, a Democrat from Massachusetts will speak about his future at the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign.
He was at the center of the rumors that he might succeed Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, Trump held his 36th meeting with voters in the city format in Holyoke after taking office.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and restore the power that was not working properly, and that meant that women should be in top leadership.
Suspect arrested after Louisiana State University player Sims died in a shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at 11 a.m.
On Thursday, they posted a video of the shooting online and asked for help identifying the person in the photo.
Sims, 20, was shot dead outside the campus of Southern University on Friday.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Sunday that Wade Sims had been shot in the head and died.
When Wade tried to protect his friend, Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, using a weapon, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department without incident.
A 6-foot-1 senior at Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games, starting 10 of them last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world championship title after losing to Sebastian Vettel.
On Saturday, when Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes would play a big role in the race.
Bottas started off the pole with a good performance, almost knocking Hamilton out of the game, defending his position in the first two corners and calling on Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettle went in the hole first, and he left Hamilton to start the traffic at the end of the line, something crucial had to happen.
Mercedes later made a lap around the circle, leaving Fettel behind, but Hamilton took the lead after equalizing with the wheels, forcing the Ferrari driver to leave the interior space free, making two categories of moves to defend in the third corner.
Max Westpen started from the back row and finished seventh after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
After leading for most of the race, Kimi was able to keep his tires on and beat Raikonen to finish in the top four.
On lap 44, he crashed into the pits and failed to improve his speed on the final eighth lap, and Raikkonen came fourth.
It's a tough day because Valterie did a great job all weekend and he passed me by like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job to shoot two rabbits with one shot", Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language .
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for not passing a letter from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accusing her of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Speaking at the West Virginia convention, the president didn't just speak directly about the testimony given by Ford, he said in the middle of the Senate Judiciary Committee against him that the circumstances in the Senate made people look like liars, hypocrites, untrustworthy.
"What you've been seeing in the Senate these last few days is you're seeing the faces of people, people who are bad, hypocritical, lying", he said.
If you look at the gaps and the craziness, they say, "Oh, I didn't do that".
"I didn't do this".
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you go public?
And remember, his answer -- you've released the document -- "Oh, what?
Oh, no, not really.
"I did not publish"
Okay, wait a minute.
We have not announced it", he said, under the influence of the senator.
Feinstein received a detailed letter from Ford in July about the charges against Kavanaugh, which was dated early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide, Doctor, it was Ford's conclusions, I didn't publish his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
And he said unto me, Keep this secret; and I kept it secret, as he said.
But his reprimand didn't seem to please the president, who was speaking at the rally on Saturday night, who said, "I'd tell you that was really bad body language.
He may not have done it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The president speculated that the Democrats were using the indictment to their advantage by continuing to defend the nomination for the Supreme Court of the man who accused three women of sexual assault.
"They are determined to restore power by any means necessary.
"You see the uselessness and hypocrisy, it doesn't matter who they have to target and crush to gain power and control", the president was quoted as saying by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 with the Belfast giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Dundee Stars
The Dundee Stars won the replay 5-3 on Friday against Dundee and lost the elite league against the Belfast giants.
The Giants had an early lead with two goals, thanks to the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney, Dwyer rose to the top before regaining the leadership of the Giants.
Before Lundwald Nielsen's two goals, François Bouchard equalised the score with Dundee.
This was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keef, who came from behind to beat Belfast Dundee 2-1 on Friday evening.
The Giants won their last three games, and this was the fourth meeting between the two sides this season".
With David Rutherford, who was assisting with the opening assistant Kendall McFall, Bouvier doubled the lead after four minutes.
Sullivan returned the game-winning touchdown to 13:10 in the first period before Matt Marquardt was the quarterback to equalise Cooney at 15:16.
When Dwyer scored the second goal at the end of the first period, the giants saw that they had the advantage in the first half.
The owners of the field were again grouped, and Buchar counted them again.
Cooney man Charles Corcoran joined Nelson for the first time to help Dundee take the lead in the match late in the second half, and he was convinced in the final period that his team would win the game in the fifth quarter.
The Giants have now lost four of their last five games and will play their next game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
A dispatcher died while rescuing hundreds of people from earthquake
A flight controller who helped hundreds of people in Indonesia to get a full plane off the ground safely and then died has been given a hero's medal.
On Friday, a massive earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi, killing more than 800 people and leaving many missing.
Strong underground dams continue to devastate the area, many of them in the city of Palo.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Guenavan Agung refused to leave his job in the heavily balanced control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed on the runway to ensure that Baltic Air Flight 6321 could safely take off.
He then jumped from the control tower, thinking it was falling down.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation Representative Johannes Sirayet said the decision saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We built a helicopter to take him from Balikpappan in Kalimantan to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost the helicopter before it reached Palau.
"This is very hard for us to hear", she said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach a thousand, as the country's agency for disaster relief says access to Donggala, Sigyi and Butong is limited.
The number of victims is still expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble, many of which are inaccessible", said Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Soutopo Agency.
The waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters) destroyed the Palau, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and food supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops were looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is helping survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
It's a tragedy, but it could have been worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, the Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by a massive earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Air Newgini reports missing person from plane crash in Micronesia
The airline, which operated the crashed flight over the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia, has reported that one person is still missing, and all 47 passengers and crew have been safely evacuated from the flooded aircraft.
Air New Guinea said in a press release that it was not possible to account for the man who was a passenger on Saturday.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water during a landing at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said that seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them are in a stable condition".
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remained unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jones said the plane was flying very low.
"That's a good thing", said Janez.
Jaines said that he and others were able to swim to the bottom of the sinking plane and reach the emergency exits.
He said the pilots were screaming and shouting, and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy, which is working to improve the nearby dock, said sailors had helped rescue the plane using inflatable boats before it sank to 100 feet (30 m).
Flight safety network data shows that 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them are related to Air New Guinea.
Analyst has published the nightly schedule of a woman who was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case in the case of a man who burned a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the US Department of Justice, was an expert in intelligence analysis and was able to justify it.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Clarion Ledger claims that Roulette received location data from several cell phones, which revealed that she was with Tellis Chambers the night she was killed, which contradicts Tellis' previous answers.
When the records showed that his cell phone records were with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford testified that he was not in the city on Saturday.
Since prosecutors claimed that Tellis Sanford was in the truck, prosecutors asked Sanford if he was telling the truth, and he replied, "He's lying, my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that when Chambers died, Tellis said that she had known him for about two weeks.
The cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from her phone a few days after Chambers' death.
"She wiped him out of her life", Hale said.
The defense must begin the final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to be submitted to the jury later that day.

New York nanny sues a married couple for "racist" text
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a complaint from a parent that a black man in the city had been discriminating against her.
The couple denies being racist, and they consider the lawsuit "disruptive".
Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman, a mother of two, was upset when she first got a job in 2016 when she learned that new baby-sitter Giselle Morris was black.
"Wow, what a black man", Lynsey Placebo-Flaxman wrote in a note to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, Maurice sent her to the lady twice.
According to the New York Post, Placebo-Flaxman, feeling guilty, claimed that the "discomfort" of the poor performance of the African-American nanny had prompted Morris to fire her and expect a Filipino instead.
Morris paid her a day's wage and sent her home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing to recover $350 a day for six months of unemployment for a couple he fired.
"I wanted to show them that they can't do what they know", she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple responded to the charge of "racist" by stating that they could not trust Morris after the accusation, and that firing him was a reasonable decision.
My wife sent him something she had no intention of telling him.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist", her husband, Joel Plateau, told The Post.
Would you give your children to someone who treated you badly, even if you were wrong?
A newborn baby?
Please come".
Describing the complaint as a hoax, Placebo said that his wife had been pregnant for only two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you go after something like that?
This is not a good thing", the investment banker said.
As the trial progressed, the court of public opinion was recording the couple for their behavior and logic.
A new letter from Paddington publishers says that readers are not so sure about a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "Until it is published, it is difficult to imagine yourself in the shoes of the person who first reads it.
It's interesting to see what we've learned about Paddington's great success".
He noted that his father worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about a teddy bear, and that his initiative was not well received, but was considered optimistic, and after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a "bitter" victory.
Describing Paddington as a very important member of his family, his father said he was proud of his late achievement.
"He was not arrogant, but he was very calm and modest", she said.
"But Paddington was so true to her, it was like you had a child and you were proud of what he had achieved, even if it wasn't your job.
I think that's how he evaluated Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always respected Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, she was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked with their lives to save her life.
"Ned kept calling and saying that he felt bad and that he had no intention of doing this", Ms. Ednan-Laperez said.
"Then Ned called me and said he was going to die in two minutes, so I had to say goodbye.
I did.
And I said, O rock, my soul, I love thee.
I will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication he was given to stop his heart attack was slowly losing its effect and leaving his body.
He had died many times before, and this time was the last.
I knew that all this was true, but I had to sit and wait a while.
I was surrounded by families and people, so I couldn't scream, cry, or cry.
I really had to keep it all inside".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperez, who was still in tears of grief over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers.
"No one knew", he said.
And when I lift up my head, the tears of my eyes run down.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a special connection with Ned.
She needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Open letters of condolence from women for the prevention of suicides on bridges
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to ensure that others do not take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up these cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help with.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any other parent to feel what I'm forced to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, said that her son had a great future as a chef.
"Everyone recognized her by her smile.
They always said that her smile would brighten up any room".
But he was in prison, and he had left his work before he died".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother gave birth to a baby boy after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis: "I'm always distracted by the effects of being shocked".
Ms. Davis made maps to let people know that there are people they can go to for help, even if they're friends.
Don't sit quietly - you need to vent and talk to someone".
Mrs. Humphries, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years shortly after her mother died.
"He never said anything about being depressed or going into a breakdown", she said.
"A day or two before Christmas, we noticed a change in her attitude.
He was in the dungeon on Christmas Day, and he would take the children's presents when they were opening them, and he would take their eyes".
She said that her death was a huge blow to them, but they had to work through it: "It's destroying the family.
He will tear us to pieces.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

The fate of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could get what he asked for - a limited investigation, even if it was small, of a time scale, we could have a unified committee", Flake said on Saturday, noting that he feared the committee would collapse amid a deep-rooted guerrilla clash.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
It depends on the time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6 - and if the Republicans are as bad as expected, they are seriously weakened in their bid to nominate a candidate for the Supreme Court.
George Bush called the senators to support Kavanaugh, who had been working in the White House and had met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases the report?
Currently, voting is held in the Senate, which is composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to be impeached and his nomination confirmed by the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean refugees has declined.
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, the South Korean legislature said.
ParkBeng-Segu, citing the Ministry of Southern Cooperation, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates charged by smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of immigrants from the North are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that after the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea - easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks.
This was the case when US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore in June, a historic meeting where they agreed to work on the Korean Peninsula's non-proliferation agenda on a mutually agreed basis.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on US sanctions since then.
"When there is no distrust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, we will not allow unilateral disarmament", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" because she believes he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was completely unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"If I ever wanted a woman to do that, they would think it was a travesty", Pelosi said Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to Kavanaugh's response to the witness.
Dr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations of sexual assault against Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was at his inauguration, talking about his family and his high school years, and sometimes he was loud and nervous.
He also publicly denounced Democrats on the committee who accused democracy of being a "grotesque and coordinated assassination" organized by liberals who lost the 2016 presidential election to Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi was convinced that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was anti-Democratic.
"I don't think he knows how to deal with these concepts and after the Clintons and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi, if confirmed, will try to implement Kavanaugh, if the Democrats support a majority in the House of Representatives, she will demonstrate.
"I'm going to say this - if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not just go to the Supreme Court, he should be in court now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the DC Court of Appeals.
Pelosi, as a democracy, is opposed to the potentially illegal Kavanaugh decision on Affordable Care Act, or Roe v. Wade, which is considered conservative justice.
Kavanaugh, during his confirmation hearings, asked whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
It's not the time to go to court for a hysterical, lying person, and we say, "That's not cool".
And women should use it.
It's a fair diatribe, a spill of months and years, and he can't mourn it.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I think it's not uncommon.
And he said unto me, My anger is kindled against this woman, and she wept; and he said to him, I am grieved, for I weep.
I'm hungry. I'm not hungry.
And then he went on.
And then I thought, "Well, it was good".
The tears are half of anger, because they are not understood.
One of my fondest memories of my early work in an office filled with men is when I was crying in a state of uncontrollable anger, and an elderly woman, who I was always afraid of, grabbed me by the waist and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're a widow.
They think you're not in the mood and they're happy to have you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential race.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and was dropped from the race.
"It was a bad decision", he said, laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, but they needed another one.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Sketches.
Because he was late in the campaign, he was late in the fundraiser, so he said he wasn't going to run until he had raised $2 million.
He was losing the battle.
He found that if his supporters wanted to give him $1,000, they could give him $250.
They wanted to know if I was being given a break.
When she announced she was not running a campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotion, thanking people for supporting her, not anger at the sexism that had paralyzed her, but anger at the system that had made it harder for her to raise funds and achieve her goal with voters.
"If you can imagine how nervous I was", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press had affected her.
"When Kleenex became my corporate sponsor.
They thought about what they were going to put in my grave.
Is she crying?
What would a trade war between the US and China do for Beijing?
While the start of the US-China trade war has shocked the world, and it seems unlikely to end anytime soon, experts say that a long-term break between the two countries could be good for Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The price increase was accelerated this week by new tariffs that affected $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, which is about half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has taken similar measures, for example, it recently imposed a tax of five to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion in response to the harsh US tariffs.
China has promised to compete with the US, but the star of the world's second largest economy doesn't seem to be shining anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw would cause a lot of unsatisfactory demands, but a U.S. withdrawal would be a very uncomfortable situation for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if the US pressure is sustained, Beijing can play its cards right and this could have a positive impact on China by weakening economic interdependence.
"Any rash policy decision by Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that would cause economic collapse in any of these countries, which is more dangerous than any outside observer would suggest", said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia Center at New American Security.
Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan says Syria is ready to return refugees
Syria said it was only willing to return refugees who returned voluntarily and asked for help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
Today , the situation in the country is stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism , he said .
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by terrorists.
Currently, all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees forced to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against the daily life and livelihood of the population.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome anyone who would help rebuild the country after the uprising.
However, he noted that he would not accept help from countries that help or sponsor the uprising by signing treaties.
Europe won the Ryder  Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States 16.5-10.5 in the final at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
This is the sixth time the U.S. has lost the Ryder Cup on European soil since 1993.
The Danish team, led by captain Thomas Bjorn, had reclaimed the European crown by scoring the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US forward Phil Mickelson, who had been performing well throughout the tournament, scored a goal on the 16th hole of the third set, handing the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in every round, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record in the current format of the tournament, which was established in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth beat the Danish Torbjörn Olesen, who had the lowest European team rating, with a score of 5&4.
Dustin Johnson, the world's best player, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Polter, who may be making his last appearance in the Ryder Cup.
The seven-time Ryder Cup champion, Sergio Garcia, became the most successful player in the history of the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
"I usually don't let myself cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It was a very difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for trusting me.
I can't believe I got my cup back, I'm so happy.
"I'm happy to be able to help my team", said Garcia, who won the European Cup.
He handed the relay to John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, a legendary golfer from the United States, 2-1 in a single game.
"I'm proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, a kid who grew up watching him play", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
It's a pretty big statistic for a player who's become a legend in history, having won 14 major titles and beaten only Jack Nicklaus twice.
The U.S. team, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, spent the weekend looking for a fairway, and the trio performed at a high level throughout the tournament.
After the poor performance of his teammates, the captain of the US team, Jim Furyk, said: "I am proud of the guys, they fought to the end".
We had a moment of shock in Europe this morning.
We are defeated.
I'm going to get Thomas.
He is a real captain.
The 12 players who followed him also performed well.
We're rebuilding the team, working closely with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're just going to keep moving forward.
I love all 12 players and it is a great honor to captain them.
You have to bow your head.
We played hard".
Red wave news: Concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to a report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the Tampa Bay area is experiencing a drop in Red Wave concentrations.
The FWC reported that the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier were experiencing a boom, which contributed to a decrease in concentrations.
The red wave stretches about 130 miles along the coast from Pinellas in the north to Lee counties in the south.
You can find fragments about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but that's a lot less than the week before.
The red wave was also seen in Pasco County.
During the previous week, there were reported moderate concentrations in and around Pinellas County, with low to high concentrations in and around Hillsborough County, high concentrations in Manatee County, high concentrations in and around Sarasota County, medium concentrations in and around Charlotte County, high concentrations in and around Lee County, and low concentrations in and around Collier County.
Respiratory irritation is still being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
In the past week, there have been no reported cases of respiratory irritation in North Florida.
