A 9-year-old boy who was on the run in Tampere was found
Police have been on a manhunt for a 9-year-old boy who escaped from Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing person report about a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has been circulating on social media.
The police situation center says that the boy has been contacted and there is no danger to his life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening News at midnight, knowing that the boy had been found.
She's fine, and we're starting the follow-up.
He was found in the vicinity of the house, his father told me.
Ronaldo again in a wild rage - ripped the goal gap to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued his exploits in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League title turned out to be, at least for a moment, in the latter's favor.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved into the top of the all-time goalscoring list by himself, when he hit the away Shahtar Donetsk's net with two penalties and one from the field.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80 when Messi, who was tied with him in Barcelona before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have been in a slump in the Italian football league Serie A since the start of the season, but in the Champions League group D, they started strong with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus' Alvaro Morata, ten minutes before the end.
The attack on City was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who had a knee problem.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's league game, didn't come on until the last ten minutes.
Manchester United also suffered a tough defeat in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 defeat.
The away game for 20-year-old ManU quarterback Luke Shaw lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerously-looking slide hit the goal against the attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his ankle.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but the ManU joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno tied the score before extra time.
PSV's winning goal in the second half was scored by Luciano Narsingh.
The Champions League season began with a goalless draw by Paris Saint-Germain in the A-Division.
It was the Argentine Angel Di Maria who had traded the Manchester United shirt for the PSG shirt.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored in the second half, 2-0 to PSG.
PSG have been voted the best team of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the smaller league clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his starting team Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career at Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team TsSKA of Moscow lost in the B-Block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation . The president made a false speech .
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had a month ago.
President Robert Mugabe has repeatedly delivered the same speech in the parliament of Zimbabwe as he did at the end of last month.
Mugabe, during his 25-minute speech, apparently didn't realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised questions about the 91-year-old Mugabe's mental health.
The main opposition party MDC has demanded Mugabe step down as he is too old to govern.
Mugabe's aides were quick to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe's leadership and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was about China's influence on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria call for an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra EU summit next week to deal with the refugee crisis.
The European Council President, Donald Tusk, who chairs the summits, will assess the request.
The Commission has also proposed that the EU should take measures to ensure that the EU's citizens are protected from the risks of illegal immigration.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
Teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call.
A slightly colored voice, university professor Shannon Lamb, tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that police need to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably in shock, and said that the contact information for the dead woman's next of kin is on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on the angry page: "I am so sorry I wish I could undo this love I had for Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me", said the letter, which experts say is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 300 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a detained history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university officials heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll had risen by one more, with Lamb committing suicide while police were surrounding the place.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motives the day after the school shooting left students and staff hiding behind locked doors.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released data showing that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher who may have had problems.
The students told me they were waiting for his feelings.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked "the wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended each man's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of trouble.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "like something was wrong".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested a medical leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay policy meant that although Lamb had worked hard towards his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic promotion and an assistant professorship.
University President William LaForge said that to his knowledge there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "clearly Lamb had something on his mind".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb fled campus, police caught up with him as he moved back from Mississippi to Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, said Methel Johnson, the Washington County coroner.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 as a lecturer in geography and education.The university has 3,500 students and is located in a town with a population of around 12 000.
Lamb completed his doctorate in educational psychology this spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston was in high school with his friends, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were melting wax when he was there, said Hairston, now 40, of Brandon, a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the riverfront in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Shawn O'Steen, the ex-husband of Princess, said that they separated 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset", O'Steen described her daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Princess when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainer at The Julep Room, a gritty bar near Gautier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night before September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lip harp performance for a small audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We played games and threw stitches at each other.
So they were both pretty smart.
The late teacher, Schmidt, led a first-year seminar program specializing in Indian and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school's English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday evening, a candlelight vigil was held at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by some 900 people, including faculty and staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the service, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
You're going to be back in class Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to heal.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to the report.
The case has been corrected to the point that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby retailer says that current permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to work more hours.
The company claims that it plans to employ 40 000 people to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, compared to 45 000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews for applicants will begin this month, and staff numbers will increase from October to December.
With the holiday season in full swing, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help staff stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his date with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox in his career.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me", he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie starts and I'm just a little bit away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back to the Future, featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "To me, it is without a doubt the greatest time travel movie of all time".
Back in Time will be available on pre-order, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says Syria's situation won't be solved by armed force
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict is not "solved by armed force" and that additional weapons only exacerbate the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief reiterated his call for all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the Ministerial Week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division between the Council, the Syrian people and regional actors had made the situation impossible to resolve.
He called on the five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unanimity in dealing with the Syrian crisis as they did in negotiating the Iranian nuclear programme.
8 polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him a wind-up.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some of them are waiting to collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to smooth Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
In the last 11 national polls, 10 of them, Donald Trump has been leading by double digits, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's chances of being appointed.
It's early days, of course.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become the Republican nominee.
The commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership to the rising Herman Cain, both of whom failed to win back any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noticed Trump's resilience and started using their resources to bring him down.
The following recent opinion polls suggest that the real estate king is not a passing phase:
Trump's popularity numbers have turned upside down.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans favored the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 percent.
Right now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first-choice states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be happy if Trump were to run.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they'd be either "interested" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two in 10 said they'd be shocked if he was a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of those who are interested vs. 40% of Trump).
Next most exciting thing?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if the incumbent's favorite, Jeb Bush, were to be elected.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Despite widespread criticism of Donald Trump for his powerful speeches and insults, a Monday ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters nationwide think the real estate king has the qualities of a president.
Quinnipiac's poll last week showed that in Iowa, the first state to hold a party convention, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the character to be a leader.
But according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think he's not fit to be president, and nearly six in 10 think he's not fit to be in the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like the commentators, they think Trump is the real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of 10 people said Trump was the most likely candidate when asked who was most likely to be nominated by the Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten voters backed Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball possible.
Last election, this time, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry should be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters find Trump's campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were to stand for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, as anti-Trump support has been split among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gets a majority in almost every case.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate Trump will win?
If they were to be matched, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a whopping 18 points.
The overwhelming majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that just over half of the voters who support Trump have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that he will never change his mind.
46% said they might change candidates.
Anyway, Trump's biggest rival right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "space-travelers" two months ago in his campaign speech, immigration has been the focus of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's power will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has risen to a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have the support of about half of the Republican voters, due in large part to their position outside politics.
Six out of 10 Republicans said in an ABC/Post poll Monday that they'd rather choose someone outside of politics than someone with government experience.
They're also angry at the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at the Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn meets David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn will be asked his first six questions shortly after noon, and it is likely that both the media and Labour MPs will be watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has been demanding for this weekly show "less theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the events to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Federation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the national anthem at a memorial service on Tuesday, the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has drawn criticism from Conservative MPs and been featured on several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
Corbyn's spokesman said he had "stood respectfully silent" and acknowledged the "courage of the Royal Air Force in the air war of Great Britain".
Corbyn's shadow government member Owen Smith told BBC Twon Newsnight that he had urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite his belief that the royal household should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements over economic, defence and foreign affairs, with less than a sixth of the original parliamentary party supporting him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that the lines of contention about the party's position in the European Union and the government's subsidy ceiling have 'combined' within the Labour Party too since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told the central union meeting that the Labour party is proposing a change that would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, the Shadow Government's Secretary for Work and Pensions, Mr Smith, said the party had been "quite clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £230,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has met in the last decade as leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has 'stacked' ideas into questions for the Prime Minister, receiving over 30 000 proposals.
Corbyn, MP for Islington North, has said that the nature of the PM's interview sessions is too conflicting and that he intends to refrain from both clever language and slander, instead focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the Shadow Government's Economic Secretary Angela Eagle will act as his deputy during the interview when Corbyn is not present, for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues could also be allowed to speak at times and he has said he has approached the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, on the subject.
When Cameron took office in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the political theatre often associated with the prime minister's question-and-answer sessions, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important gauge of the Leader's discretion, his control of the House of Commons and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized the question time as a mere satire requiring far-reaching reforms.

The value of the pound rises as UK wages rise
The value of the pound rose after the numbers appeared to rise in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the bidding point of SABMiller.
Between May and July, wages in the UK, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009 and was seen as bringing with it estimates of a rise in exchange rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% to $1,5505 against the euro and by 0.84% to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed upwards by 1,49% to 6229,21.
SABMiller was the most distinguishing share on the market, rising by 20% after being approached by its competitor AB InBev.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share price rose by 0.9% following encouraging news from rival luxury group Richmont.
The latest sales figures from Richemont were better than expected and furthermore showed that sales in China, Burberry's key market, had started to grow again.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining giant disclosed that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mond were the biggest losers of the index, with 4,3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation of the company to the form smy.
JD Sports rose by 3,1% after the sportswear company disclosed its six-month pre-tax profit, an increase of 83% to £46.6 million.
The CEO of JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, head of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage is raised in the UK, it could mean that 'potential consumers' purchasing power is increased'.
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be reflected in the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grassroots campaign against the Aldi encroachment.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend IGA traders' market share in South and Western Australia ahead of Ald's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming in, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food retailers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA's dealers and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offer deliciousness in IGA's stores, and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian rules football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron ore hosts its annual Investors Strategy Day.
The stakes are high, as South and Western Australia together account for almost 30% of Metcash's IGA retail area and have higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network of eastern states.
Shopping in South and Western Australia is known to be corner-bound, with IGA retailers having a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the south and 24% in the west, compared to 14% in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture around 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, with sales coming from all operators but mainly from independent dealers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA's retailers could lose $360 million in sales annually and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the west next year, generating a turnover of between 500 and 600 million dollars in these areas.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes at Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash approximately $13 million in operating expenses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA's customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and beverage sales will decrease by 3,8% in 2016, 4,1% in 2017 and 2,1% in 2018, with a reduction in its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10,3% in 2020.
Last week, the managing director of a leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has declined to comment publicly on Douglas' comments.
However, it is understood that a member of the Metcash board of directors contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the revenues from Metcash's food and beverage business, which supplies products to some 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of the operations in the face of pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is holding its own, and has invested more than $150 million annually in bringing prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish their stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private label products to the market.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that price reductions and store improvements have increased its appeal and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to a path of earnings growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
The President of the Australian Tennis Association , Steve Healy , is supporting the Thanasi Kokkinakis .
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis, who has suffered as a sideline in the recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios, deserves credit rather than criticism for his own behavior, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association.
The younger member of the talented duo known as "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was unwittingly exposed to the public for the incident in which Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a fiery card match in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate Cook and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid".
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in a double-header with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I'm pretty much of the opinion that Thanasi has just been dragged into the fray", Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost to a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he gets frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he's been doing really well, including in some pretty provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little rough.
He's very mature for 19 years, he works hard, he fits in the team, and so on, and he's never had any problems with other players, he's appreciated in the dressing room, he's training hard, he's in good shape, and he's a pretty calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios to the important games starting on Friday, describing this as a 'joint decision' in the best interests of all, but still supports the return of the Canberra international to the team.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And Nick has risen up really quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's growing up in public, and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for the team and for him if he spends some time away from public life thinking about those consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter illegally, in order to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in the neutral zone, and Serbian authorities responded with a stunning response.
People fleeing violence in their home countries have now pitched their tents and settled indefinitely on a road junction between the checkpoints of the two countries.
But frustration grew.
As the police helicopter stopped above them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was 'impossible' to accept the return of migrants from Hungary, as more and more migrants from Macedonia and Greece continue to arrive.
 ((((Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The EU is also committed to the implementation of the EU's new rules on the free movement of goods and services.
The mixed situation on the Hungarian-Serbian border arose after the failure of the Group of 28 nationalities at a controversial meeting in Brussels on the drafting of a common immigration policy.
Ministers agreed on a distribution of responsibilities for the 40,000 asylum seekers now in Italy and Greece, and they spoke of the hope of reaching a final agreement - by next month or the end of next year - on which EU countries would take in the additional 120,000 refugees, including a part from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extra EU summit next week on Tuesday to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary, however, does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act anytime soon.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to respond to the crisis, allowing for road closures and speeding up asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie DAgata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main bottleneck and point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is in stark contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now make it a crime to attempt to cross or damage the 4-meter (13 ft) barbed wire fence the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"The Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency because of the situation caused by mass immigration", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the deployment of troops expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's national security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that authorities had arrested 45 people as they tried to cross the border, including 15 who had already made it further into the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now in police custody, and are charged with violations defined by the new laws.
The authorities are fixing the fence fast.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border with Serbia after sending a barbed-wire train car to close one of them.
The main border crossing point near Roszka, Hungary, was covered in chaos as Hungarians opened a small office to a metal box for processing people and the mobs tried to force their way in.
About 20 got in, but thousands stayed out.
A group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 election: national poll shows Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has narrowed to
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead the Democratic primary, but Senator Bernie Sanders is closing in on her.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the Democratic electorate (down from 58%) and the runner-up Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will run for president, but he is backed by 15 percent of the Democratic voters.
With more than five months to go before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided who they're voting for.
But Clinton's supporters are more committed to their own choice than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has been declining in several demographics since last month's CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has been up a bit.
Clinton is strong in the women's and moderate leadership, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has fallen dramatically, and Sanders is only five percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead among the under-50s has been lost, and he's now on par with Sanders.
But Clinton is clearly ahead of the older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by a double-digit margin against the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the Democratic voters in the country say they'd be eager to support Clinton if she becomes the party's nominee.
A quarter say they support him with some reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would be eager to support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open-ended question why they wanted her to run, the most popular response was that she had the right experience (16 percent), followed by the most popular responses that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the office (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mentioned his connections with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president is a major influence on the possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of the Democratic voters would like to see him in the race, even though one-third disagree.
When asked who they would pick as the next party nominee, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they'd vote for Biden, who is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead on Sanders will grow, and if Biden goes, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he doesn't, the lead will be 30.
55 percent of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but that number is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far behind on this scale, but the percentage of those who think he's the most likely to vote has increased.
However, when asked what was most important in a candidate, Democratic voters elevated opinion over voting ability.
And last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered impossible for these voters.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party's voters.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's best bet is the three of them, and the strength of Clinton is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as many as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically in agreement.
When you look at all of these things, about a quarter of the Democratic voters say they have no opinion on Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server as secretary of state continues to raise questions, the majority of Democratic voters are happy with her explanation of the issue and say it has not affected their public opinion of her.
But it's different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the American public is now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third is satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March soon after the matter came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion of her has deteriorated.
More than six out of 10 Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has gotten worse.
While voters in Clinton's own party consider him honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, with only 32 percent considering him honest and trustworthy, a figure that has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62 percent of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
Meanwhile, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide also disagree with Trump's views on honesty and trustworthiness.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many people don't have an opinion of him, just as they don't have an opinion of Carson.
The margin of error in the survey, which included 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a national poll.
Ben Carson is getting close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times interview.
Two candidates in the new poll garnered half the total vote, leaving the rest to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly supporting Trump, who has risen from 23 percent in the previous CBS poll, conducted before last month's Fox News debate, to 27 percent in the poll released Tuesday.
But Carson went from a staggering 6 percent to 23 percent in the same time frame.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well in various demographic groups and is on track to outperform Trump among the highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's approval rating has fallen the most, from 10 percent last month to 2 percent today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third place at 6 percent.
The margin of error in this latest poll of 376 Republican voters, conducted in September, is +/- 6%.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson on the rise in the polls, with 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump ahead of him at 32 percent.
Also, according to the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity soared last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
A member of the Five Sisters is charged with the murder of a freshman at Baruch College .
Almost two years after a student was killed at a fraternity shedding ceremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College, New York City, brutally attacked Chun Michael Deng during a membership ceremony in September 2013, and then delayed his transportation to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng was blindfolded and had a bag of over 30 pounds [13 kg] of sand loaded onto his back, after which he was repeatedly kicked to the ground as he tried to walk through the icy field toward the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The brothers did not call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the Internet for information on his symptoms, and contact the national president of the fraternity, Andy Meng, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual gear and thus put the welfare of the fraternity before Michael Deng", said police chief Wagner.
Dengi was unable to be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity violence, with at least one student dying every year since 1970", Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County grand jury has decided to convict the first five members of the jury on charges of third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent harassment and criminal conspiracy.
"We do not want to hold individuals responsible, but if there is an organisation behind what happened, which has accepted the situation, either officially or unofficially, they must be held responsible", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the National Fraternity cut ties with the local chapter.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The interest rate hike will come, and the bull market will crash, bond yields will rise, and the economy will go into recession.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long this is going to take or how long it's going to take.
The past is of little help in timing, especially in economics.
The recession has lasted from the first drawdown, sometimes only 11 months, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US central bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in the response of the economy and financial assets.
That is why central bank officials have been so adamant that investors should focus not on the moment interest rates start to rise but rather on the cycle of developments over time leading to the normalization of the situation.
There are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the inflationary hype has been over-exaggerated.
"The central bank's first post-global economic crisis increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'cheap money' era", said Julian Jessop, senior global finance expert at Capital Economics, in a message to clients.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return to normal of US interest rates, albeit still low, to the level of the kind of disruptive shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that it will not have an impact.
The following is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react to past developments:
As the market has seen over the last month or so, waiting for an interest rate hike can make things unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not so dramatic.
"It appears that capital returns tend to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, possibly reflecting a delay in monetary policy", analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study of what happens after the central bank's increase.
More precisely, over the last 35 years or so, the market has generally been strong, rising by around 14% as it approaches the upside, 250 days later it is fairly flat (average rise of 2,6%), and normalcy has been achieved after 500 days with average returns of 14,4% over the last six cycles, according to an analysis supported by Bob Doll, chief capital strategist at Nuve Asset Management, published in Barron's.
According to Deutsche Bank, the effect on shares is usually more pronounced later in the growth cycle, when yields start to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate hikes often boost their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that have not been seen before and which may accelerate the downturn.
This is particularly true of GDP, which will be nearest to its all-time low before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 surveys since 1950, nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5% only twice.
While the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will hold when it is 1.5 percent higher in the third quarter, reports the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
The ECB's decision to increase interest rates in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raises the question of whether this time will be different, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are prepared for the central bank's raise throughout the year, and all are looking forward to this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the Committee may approve an increase at this meeting, futures trading only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our study shows that all the upward cycles since 1950 have so far been in the form of incremental leverage supercycles, where GDP has passed the pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of the recovery", the report says.
By contrast, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the worst recession of the observational period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited the longest since the end of the last recession: a record 35 months, and now it is in its 74th month.
Fixed income has also been volatile in the market in anticipation of an interest rate hike, and the model is somewhat similar to the findings on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its policy, its effects are more readily reflected in bonds than in shares.
The trend in bond yields appears to change immediately at the first raise/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the bullish cycle, bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring the yields on longer and shorter-term bonds closer together, thereby smoothing out the yield curve.
High yield bonds often yield better in this situation, although "we are still cautious about seeking return", said Kathy Jones, a Schwab fixed income analyst, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adjusted to the central bank's linear expectations.
'In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy', he wrote.
High short-term interest rates, a more even yield curve, rising credit margins and increased volatility are all features of markets when the central bank tightened its policy.
In general, companies with a strong presence in the United States benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a high level of debt perform worse when the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have to finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks are generally more profitable in the three months following the first round of funding", Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report to customers.
The companies with strong turnover outperformed the companies with low turnover by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than low quality companies, with the former averaging 4 (percentage units) and the latter 3 (percentage units).
The debt is gonna be a big problem.
The companies with a lot of variable-rate debt are the ones that are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar's appreciation.
Savers can also profit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "publicity fraud"
He argues that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just mimicking the Brit Awards.
His fellow MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, saying it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, argues a leading MP, adding to the pressure on the production company to prove it's doing something commercial production companies don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public service broadcaster appeared to be 'popular' in its content and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from its commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't like to use the term 'popular' - is turning to Classic FM", he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, only seem to be a different name for the Brit Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember straight away, where you're actually just copying something that's already on the market", Bingham said.
The BBC's CEO denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rivals in terms of live music and information sharing with the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and to musical composition is, in fact, first-rate.
'In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works', he said.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, head of BBC Radio 3, argued that the channel must do more than before to reach audiences because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer to be criticised for being a step on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition bought by the BBC from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and is by no means peculiar?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as the star judges, was produced 'somewhat in the BBC style'.
He added that he wants the production company to "find success from within your own home" the next time it starts a series.
However, he did not agree to prevent future seasons of The Voice from being produced, or to order that the money from licensees be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales were at their lowest ever in August, and Black Friday may be the reason.
Net sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month's increase was the lowest since the start of the statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online shopping was boosted by the use of mobile devices to make purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November may curb consumption
The online shopping industry has grown exponentially over the past decade, turning many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the level of the aid granted to the sampled companies.
Total expenditure in August was the lowest since the start of statistics in 2000, up only 5% from last year.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the impact of the measures on the Union industry.
"If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that things would become more rational over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales picked up steam when shoppers began using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could do it in different environments, like on the couch.
But now it's levelling out, and it can go down.
The American phenomenon of Black Friday has been cited as one of the reasons behind the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that consumers will curb their shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers lined up on their computers to grab deals, taking down many of their retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over the findings, may curb the buying process
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound in five was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than at fashion chains in shopping malls.
Muslims bury dead in Mecca elevator crash, consequences for bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first burial in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has blamed the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group, a construction giant.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the elevator collapsed.
29 dead were carried through the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when a clock tower collapsed at the Great Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead to make their final journey to Al-Moaissem's burial ground.
The sad procession passed the holy site where just a few days ago a hoist fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after the Saudi king blamed the bin Laden family construction company for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshippers of the fallen lifter at the Great Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton, a Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the lift collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already vowed to continue the Hajj to Mecca as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Group should not have left the lift up 15 feet when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's executives were prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the collapse of the lift tower in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered ahead of the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not issued any press releases on the miserable collapse, and its representatives have not been contacted for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the association of not using up-to-date protection measures and of not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
The Great Mosque of Mecca is surrounded by dozens of elevator bells, part of a vast construction project run by the Binladin Group.
The Bin Laden family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, and it has been leading major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy who was ostracized by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must make at least once in his life.
Authorities are reporting 158 people are still in the hospital.
Authorities ordered one million riyals (£174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the dead and to those permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will get half of this.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap workers are behind the popularity
British people are increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the increase
As a result, 200 more Screwfix shops for professionals will open.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be giving up their hammers and paintbrushes and preferring to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home improvements
It seems that if you're handsome with a hammer or you're busy painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
British people are increasingly hiring help to do do-it-yourself tasks in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of the home improvement chain Kingfisher, said that the popularity was due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offered their services at a ridiculous price.
This results in Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and to close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of 10 purchasing decisions made in the store are made by the prettiest sex.
Today, the majority of the staff are men.
He said that changes in population had to be taken into account: there were now more single-woman households, with more housing being built than in the past.
Laury said, "Most of our stores are still staffed by men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a large role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of only five women to lead the UK's top FTSE 100 companies, and she has rebuilt her board to include equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group to have exactly 50% women, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, "It was a conscious decision. Different is important here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both six months' revenue and sales after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores.
The three-axis government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The effects were visible quite quickly.
The sharp decision of the SAK and other wage-earners' organisations was imposed immediately and the result is a nationwide strike on Friday by workers.
And for many, that's also the time to be rational.
We'll ask them if it's worth the strike when it's bad anyway.
There's even a resistance movement.
Over 50,000 people have already gone online to announce that they will not participate in the protest and will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but to declare oneself rich openly would have been political suicide for a small person.
The protest by a few tens of thousands of people, who are members of millions of trade unions, is not a momentary one, but it does give us something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is not as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's strict solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seemingly rolling things by themselves, the unions are finally getting down to business, which is to defend the rights of the worker, visibly and properly.
The government may thus be willing to consolidate the role of the labour movement, when union membership may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one may think of the actions of the organizations, it is ridiculous that the demonstration on Friday should somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 consecutive months.
GDP continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would be on everyone's mind.
The University of Lappeenranta is on a tough savings path: 8.5 million to be saved, 130 staff to be cut
The Technical University of Lappeenranta is launching a savings programme aiming to cut costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start consultations with all staff, with a target of savings of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of approximately 130 employees.
The other activities will be designed to save an additional two million.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the implementation of the budget.
It is also affected by budget cuts by the government.
In the current financial year, the university is running a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the Ministry's funding will be reduced by EUR 2 million and the other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the University is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in business funding at our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary financing is reflected in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last for the six weeks prescribed by law.
General: Onnibus wants to go to Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, the British owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, tells Yelle that the company is also aiming for rail services in Finland.
I'm very interested in joining the Finnish railway.
My company, Stagecoach, is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
The railway sector is to be opened up to competition gradually.
The first is the local traffic in the Capital Region in 2017-2018.
After the short haul, it's long haul.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transportation.
The Transport Department says they're very happy with Onnibus' plans.
Among other international companies, at least Transdev (former Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe.
The US central bank has to make decisions about interest rates.
The rest of the world is watching as the US central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of those who believed the central bank would raise rates last week now believe the situation is not resolved and interest rates are being kept at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it's been seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
"We are approaching a situation where, for the first time, the central bank has the possibility to move out of the zero level and start normalising interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and created little inflation.
However, the ECB cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the markets that they must be ready to raise, but signs indicate that they also believe that the odds are against raising.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning before shooting his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying she was "deeply upset" about the first murder and hoped "that it could be reversed", authorities said Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier police said that Delta State University geography and social studies professor Lamb called 911 at about 10:00 a.m.
Monday and told me that he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said he killed his wife last night and also mentioned that there's a "mad dog" in the house who doesn't bother anyone but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he wouldn't tell them.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss, along with a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb, which read, "I'm so sorry I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 300 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said that to his knowledge there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "clearly Lamb had something on his mind".
Authorities said Tuesday that despite claims published Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any "triangle drama".
Shawn O'Steen said he's been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as "a good person".
The couple broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's "shocked".
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends ever".
Linsday Knowles said Prentiss was working from home online, and the Sun Herald said Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss's.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people", Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them he wasn't going to jail.
When police caught up with Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that evening, Lamb pulled his car over to the side of the road, left it there, and ran off into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb completed his doctorate in educational psychology at Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a resume on the university's website.
Stars That Lost Their Charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough few years.
In 2001, he was diagnosed with leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really does take its toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is out for two months for a double-breach .
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
Although the defender has been left in tears and will be out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hoping that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's uncontrollable punch in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into PSV's territory.
He was treated for nine minutes at the airport and had to be on oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture in his leg and is now in hospital".
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then we'll operate in Manchester.
This is terrible, because the kid comes to Manchester United at 18, he gets in trouble, and then he plays great, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm no doctor, but it'll take at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the block.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty kick.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian manager was mistaken.
You can judge for yourself when I say it was a penalty kick and a red card.
That was a really bad two-legged fight.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you for all your messages, words cannot express how disappointed I am, my recovery is now starting, I will come back stronger".
On the subject of the Manchester United suffered from the Luke Shaw case and lost to PSV
The English defender will have an extra boost to his recovery with the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury".
If a player is out because of an injury like this, everyone is very sad.
Our players never intend to offend their opponents.
Moreno broke his leg while playing for Mexico's Van Gaal against the Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this very seriously because it's not intended to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing", Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's heel.
Moreno told SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this thing can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after being interviewed by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent soon learns that if your child loves a book, it will not be long before he learns it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron, which is to say,
When the prime minister was asked by a holiday child care service which children's book he liked best, he chose Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to contain an image or a message we haven't seen before".
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new characters and details added to complement the rather short original text.
In the walled city of Tarville, where all nature has been lost and even the air is a commodity, a Ted boy hopes to win the heart of a girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see a real tree, the lyrics tell and describe a love story that was not written by Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that's not suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it's taken from a plot summary of the film Lorax found on the Internet Movie Database, which begins: "In the walled city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey".
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, in which a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by a greedy, tree-cutting, and need-picking Kerskanen, disregarding the short, bearded creature that gave the story its name, the Lorax, who "speaks for the tongues".
This relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text was likely from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England squad, but it was still a tough place.
Playing Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but given the team England have chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely that the last 3-0 series loss will be repeated.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but they have good rotators and a strong team mentality: they have no scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is improving in his rounds and Adil Rashid is the alternate forward, although he is an unknown at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth has been dropped from the England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandably difficult for me to analyse, as I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been against good strikers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged on their performance.
There was no uncertainty about the selection of Joe Root, for example, before the announcement, because, as I said earlier, the players are the best decision makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's time on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, he'll get another chance.
England manager Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he wasn't performing as well as he could have, and I'm not surprised that Lyth is a team player first and foremost.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a hitter takes to leave a trail.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, as was Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton got to play both home and away.
The only complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean when Lyth was in prime shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's got a batting lineup I appreciate.
He has something in him as a cricketer that we in Yorkshire saw early in the season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but that depends, of course, on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been some talk of Moeen in the opener with Cook, getting an extra pitcher on the field but keeping four fastballs, and I'm not against that.
I don't see why the batsman couldn't hit there, and this left-hander has already proven himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he's a three to them, and there's not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games at the first downside before moving on to the 2001 Open.
He scored 300 points straight away and didn't remember anything.
Zafar Ansari is coming on as a backup pitcher, and, from the little I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People might look at his unadorned statistics, hitting 31 with the ball, 35 with the ball, and think it's a gamble, but there aren't too many pitchers available, and the selectors chose the young ones.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a stroke of genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings with him a tremendous amount of experience, because he's done everything in every situation and against every kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is joining the White Ball games, bringing with him both energy and a ruthless vanishing.
I've always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the same exploitable intelligence as Mahela.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room can refresh a team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team-mate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is being laid off in the ODIs, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that at all.
Even though everyone doesn't agree, the coaches and the selectors don't make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Decisions like this are never made lightly.
Brexit supporters may take advantage if the economy fails in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are getting more and more difficult by the day, even without considering the heartfelt Jeremy  Is it yes or no? Corbyn's choice of Labour leader or the trade union's anger at Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat friend recently explained that because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are fed up with the British self-centered agenda, which is full of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these states largely do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Federation of Trade Unions decided that it did not want them either if they undermined social protection.
We could call it the Dave and George selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument with or without a local eyewitness, and then come home saying they're winning supporters for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the British EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France", they say in Berlin - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care if we stay or go.
The cautious and moderate German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it goes bad, as did the overstayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland of France faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fleeting force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the self-absorbed, when their energy should be focused on preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either, because of their own similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even be deliberately planning to make useless Scottish National Party-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
The renegotiations had been arranged and had no meaning for Britain.
Europeans have had a taste of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how sceptical the dictators of the press are about the EU, which they were not in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the greatest European opportunist, who made a name for himself by writing 'the banana of the EU' while he was a correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a large group of tax-cheaters, foreigners who hacked phones, and individuals whose name is not in the country and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a gorilla that's lustful, you have to give up bananas for the sake of the trick, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and then later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's renegotiation drive, as Bair had agreed in principle to the EU's rejected constitution, which French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's '80s strategy of boycotting Murdochia, which was a mistake both then and now.
While it may take time, he must develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Murray, whose BBC chairmanship Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in the renewed EU.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party's Ukippish war-melting fanatics and the Conservative Party's fiercest nationalists can certainly be put behind this view.
Hilary Benn, but not a Benn fan Benn said this on both radio and TV this week, when his inner scout would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice of the tough John McDonnell as the shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his father was watching TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues in the government without going so far as to lose his government seat.
Hilary's pinch was more appealing.
But the fight to stay in the game, wherever the situation is, was not what McDonnell said, nor what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional, personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), communication discipline is important in the age of 24-hour television, and especially in the whirlwinds of social media, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Mr Cameron a free flight to Europe by allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the basic tour of McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-minded regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a hard-hitting debate among left-wing thinkers for whom narcissism of small differences is central to their doctrinal strivings.
As for his double standard with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats will have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have distrustful voters) on concessions to Britain when it may be totally useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the British's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the e-cigarette estimate by Public Health England
Researchers have said that the claim by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional ones originated from interviewing 12 people, some of whom had ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published its 'pivotal report' last month, describing it as a 'comprehensive overview of the evidence'.
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and have pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The Lancet, a medical journal, published an editorial last month attacking the PHE's conclusion on the "exceptional basis of hutera".
Two other researchers writing for the BMJ have pondered whether the claims are built on rock or sand.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: 'The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.'
They say that the public's expectation that PHE's claim 'at the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes' is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one of 12 meetings where we developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions about the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were aggregated into a study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health claims of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was told he had received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for selecting the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known advocates of e-cigarettes, some of whom also report having received funding from the industry.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco department of PHE.
The study produced by the group "strongly concedes" that there is a lack of "undeniable evidence" on the harmfulness of most products and most criteria, write McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that PHE's claims that there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes are a route to smoking in children or non-smokers are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made in the BMJ have been answered before.
He says: 'E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.'
Half of the people who smoke in their lifetime die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of those of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should drop EastEnders, says former Channel 4 executive
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes like EastEnders or The Voice and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for hits like this soap set in Albert Square.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to make programmes that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes with a likely smaller audience at shorter times than the most watched programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson said he tried for Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
"I don't understand the idea of the BBC producing and broadcasting programmes that are clearly suitable for unsubsidised competitors", Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of its investigation into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is to be maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this report or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not make and so on.
The Voice is being sent to the prime time because we want to get as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Mr Johnson said: 'I do not see why a regressive tax should finance programmes which could be financed without government support.
The Voice is one of them, and EastEnders is another, undoubtedly done in-house.
Frankly, the other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how this is a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in any way.
Johnson, who was the series' executive producer for Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC is engaged in audience hunting because of the goals of the people who work on the programme and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support.
His comments on the BBC's most popular series echo those of former Sky director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programmes go to BBC4, where viewership is often not measured, but the BBC is thus fulfilling its responsibilities and can then, in defence of £4 billion in licence fee revenue, hypocritically say that 'of course we are doing all these unknown programmes that nobody is watching'.
They put them in a broadcast location where no one ever comes to see them.
As regards the allowance, Mr Johnson told the committee: 'I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets the most for it.
Of course you're all thinking, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a lot of money, but I don't know if that's true for people who have 150 pounds is a lot of money because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its role in the Reith era to 'inform, educate and entertain'.
He said that only a small proportion of BBC production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% for TV production and 0.1% for radio - and that it should take the model of Australian and Canadian broadcasting and change the mission to inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms, which he said are only shown on television for a few hours, and ally itself with commercial companies so that they can all be viewed online.
"Acoustic genetics" allows for control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how the shuttle launches change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound waves.
Small shuttle missile shifts direction as soon as they are hit by a sound pulse that is too loud for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by turning on genetically engineered motor neurons that have ultrasonic-responsive film channels.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity in light
The researchers said that the worms demonstrate the effectiveness of a new technique called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain cells of the brain, heart, and muscles from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the technique may one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that uses electrical impulses to be delivered to the human brain to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttle pods do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noticed that when they were surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles amplified ultrasonic waves, which then passed into the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasound-controlled shuttle worms, Chalasani genetically engineered worms so that some of their motor neurons contained TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani applied ultrasound to the modified carpets, the micropods amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the carpets, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along an optical fiber to a desired location within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
'We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses it may be possible to make targeted human neurons instantly respond to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting,' said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
The ads are embarrassing the British arms trade
Watch the video against the Amnesty International protests.
Terrible killing machines!
The ankle-crushing cars!
The bombs!
And electric stun pumps that cause excruciating pain but leave no marks!
The cheerful tone and the graphic language of the cartoons leave no doubt that this advert for the world's largest shipyards is a sharp parody of the British government's willingness to sell arms to oppressive governments, which Amnesty International produced at a party at the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment International in the dockyard area of London.

A separate campaign also brought many posters to bus stops and subways, which required more detailed study.
 Important information, Are you travelling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September? together, using the font and logo of the London Underground, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... asking customers to help stop the parade.
These 300 posters are by the artists whose work was on display at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound pack of six-collar keys that, according to the collective, "can access one third of the advertising space at bus stops around the world".
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorised "public vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and editor of the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political works to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in the resistance, when they realized that they had to go out into the world if they wanted their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun poster greets business travelers on the subway.
The video of Amnesty has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours, and it was created for free by the VCCP advertising agency, and the graphic designer and the storyboard artist also worked for free.
Matt Leverin, creative director at VCCP, noticed that the trade shows were not advertised at all - and there was also a blank spot in the Excel calendar at the time - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic corporate ad with a shady background, but oli emphasizes the point more with bright colours and animation.
'They have done a fantastic job in helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment being sold at trade fairs', says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
Now the UK government must act and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our homes.
Perhaps the most creative art in terms of positioning comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors are trading fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in a press release that it had received an order from the US military for a rocket-launched AT4CS RS.
This includes the 'unique pipeline-tracking head, which delivers excellent effects behind the armor inside the target'.
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student apartment at the age of 19 in my ignorance, when I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the violent smiles I provoked and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Much of what I've learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from nerve-racking to completely scary.
It's tempting to have a chat: tell me where you're from, if you've had a break and where, what you think of Corbyn, and why I don't really love or hate Marmite because it's really just a funnel.
Take a breath, please.
And help others breathe, too. Ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the people you wouldn't want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they shared the extinguishers.
Give the people some room.
People's rooms often become cocktail bars, movie theaters, and places for social recreation, but they are also places where people dress and fix their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college while you're in a relationship.
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but in many apartments, a culture of room-to-room movement is formed that is friendly, social, and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want to be your friend, but you have to leave now so I can recover the energy I spent talking to you".
Try to sense when your college friend is tired of socializing and maybe text instead of knocking.
When it comes to knocking, knock.
There was this guy in my dorm who thought that if the door wasn't locked, he'd been invited in.
He saw some pretty things.
You make friends through baking.
Since you're starting college at the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate sandwich tray and introducing yourself seems somewhat less weird, less "welcome to the neighborhood", I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions from a 50-year-old.
Serving homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and they may associate your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Well, I guess that depends on how you bake.
The poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat cones are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, stealing a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It's possible they'll give you permission, even though they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you'll get my sympathy, but try to be more adult than my roommate, who mixed laundry detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You mustn't make so much noise that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot playing the kettle.
And the girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could play their drum and bass music lower, because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally stopped at five o'clock in the morning, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before she put on her own music, locked the door, and left for the three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse just happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or, conversely, would it not be incredibly embarrassing if you considered your roommate to be your future mate, you would get together, divorce, and then see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if your hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, you might at least try to reason with your bottom line.
In that exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left his key unlocked in his room, the line between teasing and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but you can take it back in a second.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a water glass, which you then put in the freezer, but don't attach their belongings to the ceiling with a blue ribbon more than twice.
Racial attack on the hostel of foreign students in Kite, house planned as a reception center was destroyed in Salo
A racist attack on the hostel of foreign students took place on Saturday morning in Kite, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police had previously said, the accommodation is not for underage asylum seekers but for foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kitee Evangelical Folk School.
The windows and walls of the public school's dormitories were strewn with racist signs, such as hook-and-loop crosses, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one dormitory, Eastern Finland police said.
Luukkainen, who is responsible for social security education for young people at the National University, said that there were an estimated ten people in the building that was the target of the violence at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move around, so some of it could be elsewhere", says Luukkainen.
The National School is home to people of 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minors seeking asylum.
Everyone in the messed-up building has an A-status.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish", Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an accident and a breach of the peace.
Luukkainen said that an information session was held for the students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters present.
There's no panic here, and no one's wanted to leave.
We've had foreign students for twelve years, and this is the first time something like this has happened", Luukkainen says.
According to Bones, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men, and they were driving a white car.
I think this is a weekend-night puzzle for young people, now that this topic has been brought up.
Nothing more serious than that", says Bone.
The hall also houses a hospital with a planned reception centre.
It happened last week.
MTV reported it on their website Tuesday night.
There was a cross on the hospital wall with the words "You are not welcome" written in English.
There's a police report.
Correction 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is stopping the Y-train for Karya, passengers in a frenzy, "just idiotic".
The Y train from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karja will stop running in March.
The news upset passengers boarding the train at the Helsinki Central Station.
The lowest rate of inflation is particularly striking the Sienese, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident of the municipality.
It is absolutely ridiculous, because the population is growing all the time and the people who are working need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot be anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in the HSTV interview video that he's coming to the capital on a tractor.
There are also changes taking place elsewhere in the New World.
The H and R trains running on the main line will be combined into a new R line.
The Purola station at Lakehead and the Nuppulinna station at Tuusula will be decommissioned.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR on Tuesday announced the information on which routes the Ministry will buy train services for the next contract period.
The contract period varies from year to year and there are cancellations throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in the autumn, will be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee at a later date.
Mr Bengtström, a member of the Sionians, considers the state railway company to be a short-sighted activity.
We're going to make the same mistakes that we've made before and we're going to repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then you feel sorry for yourself.
The Y-train is also used by people other than the Greeks and the Sicilians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyrä from Espoo was distressed by the fate of those who traveled by train farther from the city.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their trip", he said, as he grinned at the Y-train.
I promise you a little relief.
A new railway connection is likely to be built to the coastline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Regional Transport (HSL) area, which will take you to Kirkkonumm.
This will result in additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to investigate the different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices", said HSL's CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
The costs are not yet possible to estimate precisely.
Rihtniemi explains that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y-train approximately one million per year, although the Ministry has paid much more.
The R line coming up the hill is missing two stations.
In contrast, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
There are 28 small stations and numerous routes throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Spiders-Joensuu route is shortened to Spiders-Stealing.
The railway lines are decreasing on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million journeys are made in the year on the cancellable shifts, while the total number of journeys on the Ministry's purchased transport is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring about an annual saving of 12.3 million euros for the State.
The contract is worth approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in his book The Presentation of Capital: "Marx is worth learning about"
The crisis in the world economy has brought to the fore Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his major work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, former chairman of the SKP, in his book The Timeliness of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He is being taken more seriously than he has been in a long time", Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development of capitalist economy, its internationalisation and ever-widening penetration into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The author of the book based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakasen is also Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected economist at Aalto University.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
But the former director of the Institute for Economic Research and the Commission for Economic Affairs is not a Marxist, is he?
No, not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a contemporary economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are divided and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary scholar.
"The common view is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men", Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions were badly miscalculated.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the beginnings of capitalism that were too far-reaching, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical stance.
"What's relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions", he says.
Now, let's talk about Marx's interests again, like the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be an inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of technological revolution", Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is no help.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just end.
But Korkman thinks it's worth getting to know Marx.
"In the '70s, you couldn't read Marx", says Korkman.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can be approached without the ideological and political weight of the past.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's thought world - as well as with the other classics", says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be tried in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during Sri Lanka's civil war, AFP news agency reports.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was published on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
The civil war in Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There's no exact number of casualties either.
The UN report calls for a thorough investigation of the large-scale military offensive in the last months of the long war in 2009.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan armed forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely as men and women.
The report says the rebels have been guilty of forcing outsiders and children into combat.
Both parties are guilty of murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it will conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo-yo test got a social media hit.
The autumn student rolls were in long foreign language on Wednesday, with English predominant.
More than 16,000 students were tested for English.
You could write a paper on social media.
We had to ask ourselves, based on our own experiences, if social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150-250-word English article could be shown to the owner of the webpage's advice column.
The headline was "Dear Agony Aunt".
Agony Aunt is responsible for Leela's Finnish lounge chairs.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to see things from the young ones' point of view.
There were four subjects in all, one of which had to be chosen.
"That was the hardest", said Mia Lybeck, English teacher at Porvoo Swedish High School, in the third subject.
The third item was merely a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth theme, Lybeck said it was pretty cool.
It was supposed to be a fireside address about why companies should hire young people.
"At least in our school, there is a practice of writing speeches", says Lybeck, who rates the whole experiment as "quite normal".
The English test in Finnish - or Swedish - was based on texts such as the summer camel's adaptation to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
On Wednesdays, some longer Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn writing continues on Friday, when it is the turn of another native, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
The exam is held in the normal way in the high schools, so it is not affected by the protest of the salaried.
The University Grants Commission urges students to find suitable transport links in time to be able to take the test.
The time may be increased if it can be shown that the delay was not due to negligence.
A store was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu .
A shop in the Kelo district of Oulu was robbed on Wednesday morning.
Police say the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering commando vest.
He's a normal-sized man, in his early 30s.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and had taken a small amount of money as a prize.
They're investigating it as a major robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters arriving in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
A demonstration against the government's cut-down measures will hit central Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
Forecasts suggest that tens of thousands of people may attend.
The members of the SAK, Aqaba and STTK unions will meet at the Rautatientor at 11 o'clock.
Police are also believed to be participating in the demonstration.
The task of the police on duty is not only to carry out the alarm and other police duties, but also to ensure the smooth running of the giant's expression.
The roads leading to the railway zone will be closed to motor vehicles for approximately 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From Hakaneem, traffic is cut off from the Kaisaniem traffic circle, from the west from the Mainland.
Are you sure the Helsinki police department is manned enough, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For now, it looks like we're done.
I'm not taking sides on police work-fighting issues.
Kujala is also sending support patrols from other parts of Finland to Helsinki for the demonstration.
The police won't give us the exact number of patrols.
"There's some coming, but we're generally fine on our own", says Kujala.
Police are advising people to avoid private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jams extend from Hakaneeme level to its core.
Traffic will be expected to be stationary from dawn to dusk.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, many buses are also arriving in Helsinki.
They're not allowed in the Iron Shard.
The buses will stay pretty far away, basically.
The end of the journey is to walk to the protest site", Kujala says.
The protest will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From the police's point of view, there's a silver lining.
The problem of the smooth operation of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings, is now partly solved.
The organisers of the protest have informed the police that tens of thousands of people may be coming to Helsinki to protest the government's economic policies.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, the population is ordinary working people, or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people", says Kujala.
Local demonstrations are also held on Fridays in various parts of Finland.
Friday's demonstration is in many ways exceptional. Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big trade union demonstration on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, it has no good comparison in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiäinen, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
In itself, it's no wonder the A-M-A protested.
If it didn't, it would raise its hands in front of the government, says the Mushroom.
The very right-wing government has attacked the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition - and also points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough-guy grip on the law of contract is a violation of the law of contract.
There are many features of this that really try to bring the labour movement to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
The need for a mirror is, for example, because the labour movement does not have the support of all the employees for the Friday demonstrations.
What is new is the sharp division which the demonstration will produce among the people whom the labour movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland and demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you look for a comparison to the Friday demonstration, it could be the giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, organized in 1993, says Siisiäinen.
In the midst of the deepest depression, the Great Depression gathered 20,000 unemployed people.
The government of Esko Aho (centre) was going from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and the wage-earning organizations had never been as bad as during the bourgeois government of Aho.
The government and the labour movement are perhaps even worse off than they were in the days of the Great Depression.
Besides, the most bourgeois government ever in Finland is now in power, says Siisiäinen.
The current coalition government is even more interesting in that it is so far right-wing despite the talk of fundamentalists.
At that time there were still certain elements of the old workers' movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to arrive on Friday.
The protest will also stop public transport and possibly close day care centers and schools.
Even if the demonstration doesn't garner the undivided support of the wage earners, it could be the biggest in years.
In recent years, Helsinki has hosted some 300 demonstrations a year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Finnish labour movement has been relatively peaceful in its demonstrations, although its methods have become more rigid in recent years.
Traditionally, in Finnish demonstrations, conflict is avoided, and the law is obeyed.
The protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, says the Fox.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The protest culture has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on their heads.
The firemen's strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes among pilots and flight attendants.
Remember those strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strikes of 1971 and the power and electricity strikes of 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the metal workers' strike.
The strike was suspended by the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of strike action.
The metal men got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, a power strike lasted 49 days, causing power outages across the country.
The breakthrough in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom had been made unemployed by the recession, gathered in front of the House of Representatives to vote for work.
The firemen went on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest nationwide strike.
Farmers protested against the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in the rain of eggs during the anti-EU farmers' protests in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops", was one of the slogans.
The farmers of Espalle picked up tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also led to farmers protesting and burning haystacks in front of the venue.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marred by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass movements of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass deportation hastened the negotiations to a final outcome.
Doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - compulsorily", was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and sparked a lively debate about how strikes could jeopardize patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Some 5 000 students marched for student aid in Helsinki from the Senate Tower to the Parliament House in 2013.
The Central Crime Police is investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested the Central Criminal Police to help them with the background of the refugee convoy registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the ice-cream truck were all in good shape.
We've been in communication with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility will be at the scene in Austria, says the Chief Commissioner of the Central Criminal Police, Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, more fateful events befell other refugees in Austria in a truck.
All 71 passengers on board died, apparently by suffocation.
According to Yleisradion, the truck belongs to a Finnish joint-stock company.
The company operates a restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign origin, in his 40s.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for smuggling people.
The story of five smugglers, a captain who beat up refugees, a former drug runner and a wealthy businessman
A rebellious king of smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylish missionary, and a cab driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, people like this are smuggling people into the European Union.
University of Trento criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "clients", and their book Death's Travel Agency is coming out in Finnish this week.
In the book they present the complexities of human trafficking, offer solutions, and present smugglers at different levels of the business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I 'll beat the crap out of them .
The Kerkenna Islands off the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians go there for their summer vacation.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling because of their location, as the distance to Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chained captain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fisherman is more profitable in transporting people.
Emir has done it hundreds of times with his blue, 10-meter wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
The Emir earns about EUR 8,000 per trip after expenses.
The Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Clients come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, things calmed down until the refugee crisis again hit.
Clients arrive from the mainland in small groups on Kerkenna Island.
The Emir will keep them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is served in such a way that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about $75 a night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We'll go out to sea at midnight with the torch off.
The first night, you drive off the islands, then you stop, wait for the day, and the next night you drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves as high as 60 feet [20 m], the passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo will be unloaded in half an hour and Emir will leave for the return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the hangmen to death.
In the book, he tells that when the police caught him by surprise, he threw all his passengers overboard and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed the customers by the neck and threw them overboard", Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the sub-Saharan.
His countrymen say he's gonna have to beat him up about this.
I'll beat the crap out of them.
We need to show them who's in charge here right now.
Just a regular cab driver .
Goran is just a regular taxi driver in Bogova, Serbia.
His cab's not very good. The starter is dragging its last, and it's had its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are admitted.
In the forests surrounding the center, men traveling without their families take shelter in tents, lavabo, and abandoned cars, which each has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted their asylum applications to Serbia.
Some of them are also staying in private homes, but it's a public secret.
Goran finds most of his clients among the wildlings.
These are often quite exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a great deal of border crossing and weeks of walking in rough terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in Bogova, the hub of a major human smuggling operation, the people are exhausted.
The people on board Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
His best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once and it's enough", Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to get in.
That's not what Goran likes.
He's been going on and on and on all the way.
First, they agree on a price, say 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a kind and good-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people", he says in the book.
Goran says he works for less than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's a hundred miles, most of it on the freeway.
I hear the other guys are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a lot for a smuggler, but in Serbia, it's a pretty good annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis may not transport migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his passengers a mile from the border.
Then he points to his clients in the right direction and runs away.
In the Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese is called Missionary, not just a nickname.
He does have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, which is frequented by Congolese refugees, as well as a small center for Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business that moves people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a job of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of his white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of his jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary is not preaching, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five Missionary telephone numbers.
He advises arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in the trash and mingling with the traders crossing the border.
To be granted asylum or refugee status, you must tell the Ugandan authorities that you are from war zones, such as North Kivu, and that you have been forced to flee violence in your home.
Often that's true, but if it's not, the missionary will arrange for the client to have a new identity.
The old ID card will be destroyed and replaced by a new one.
The missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police are helping.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum application process, NGOs, and finally the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself came to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step individually: an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, documentation to a humanitarian organization about 150 euros, and the process of moving to a European country, for example, costs between 4 500 and 7 000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a budding smuggler, former drug runner.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the French coast at Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks en route to Britain.
He has the help of an Afghan in London, a French taxi driver, and dozens of truckers who may not even know they're in the smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually two or three people, somewhere in the vicinity of downtown Calais.
They're driving on the A26 motorway, trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been in for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his clients run across the motorway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right truck, makes sure it's headed for England and not, say, Holland, and cuts the safety wire of the shield.
We have to do it quietly, so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the job is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in aluminum foil, similar to what is wrapped around a roast or an oven dish in the kitchen.
That should keep the police's heat scanners from detecting the person hiding.
Some use an ice-filled sleeping bag for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves, hoping he won't drive the hitchhikers out of Britain.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The wealthy Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, controlling the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money on arrival.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scam: chartering pleasure boats from Turkish ports to take American or European families on comfortable, few-day tourist cruises.
In reality, the ships are full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans who are transported from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe for a fee of EUR 5 000 to 7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are being crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide in the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we must get aboard quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under deck the entire journey.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as there is no other sign of a crowd.
Food and drink are provided, but the fewer passengers who vomit and defecate, the better.
Mr Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 per luxury cruise after the costs.
He does not handle practical matters himself but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other minor factors to do the work for him.
During the summer, transportation is arranged in hundreds of ways, and Küçük makes millions.
He's been suspected of buying land through shell companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred apartments that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party (TDP) parliament and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he's apparently disappeared.

An American Olympic runner tells in her book about her illness and her prostitution
A new book by three-time Olympic 1500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of quitting his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the race in top form and ran the second fastest time in the race.
But in the final, he panicked.
He jumped to the top right from the start and defended his lead with a maniacal run.
But 150 yards before the goal, his strength ran out.
He collapsed on the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line, Favor Hamilton tells us in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide the year before the Sydney Games, and he himself was under tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of making money by having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her action.
The tax on Favor Hamilton was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that she longed for the same adrenaline spikes she had received when competing in the sport of track and field.
Favor Hamilton later found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000 he set the world record in the 1500 meters in a time of 3.57.40, but he finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was delighted when the federation put the Norwegian skier on the "straight leg" list.
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has gone beyond the bounds of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been in a state of reversal throughout the summer and autumn, as they did last year, from the athlete's contract.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northuge from the World Cup for the upcoming season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the skier in charge.
"Thank you for showing your back", Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook page.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the federation's sponsor", he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would like to be part of the national team for the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Mr Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations and does not allow one athlete to go solo.
He also recalled that the Union had granted Northug financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been a part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug issued a statement on Tuesday, saying he wanted to play in Norway's colours at the World Cup next season and at the World Cup and Olympics afterwards.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six medals at the World Championships, two of them gold.
He was on the team that won the gold medal in Falun last winter.
The day of the shield-maker is also celebrated in the Nordic countries
On 25 September, the day of the shield, there will be a parade of the various restaurants and shops which have been awarded the shield of the "Cooking-Translators".
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of expertise in the food sector and to lower the barrier of going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the label as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-end restaurants are concentrated in the capital area, but that top-end restaurants, which are inspected and rated by an independent operator, can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is a demonstration of the significance of the event as part of the awareness raising of T-shirt restaurants and the organisation.
In the Nordic countries, the day is celebrated at Vaasa, a restaurant in Fond du Nord and in Kantarellis.
The Old Town restaurant is participating in the Shield Day collection.
The event has also attracted considerable international attention.
It was decided to make the event one of the organization's most important international events, held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki-journal: Sued for the establishment of a terrible reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhavan garrison, which is now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure of a crisis nature, which is still permanently located in the area and used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland Erillisverkot Oy, is still in operation.
Kauhajoki-jurnal reports that the individual claimed that the placement of the reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant security risk, which was not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
The complainant claims that the Defence Forces may have interests in the former Air Force Academy site and its airport, the impact of which has not been ascertained during the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case notes that, in the case of Kauhavana, negotiations have been ongoing for the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the entry of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, inter alia, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and the Minister of Defence's Chief of Staff, Arto Rädy.
The individual states to the Chancellor that the complaint is not about the reception centre's objection in principle but about the incorrect location of the planned site in the former garrison area.
The dreadful city council discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'common transit' in the directive.
The President said that the concern for the management of the refugee situation united all the participants.
He also called for the EU to be involved in the negotiations on the future of the EU.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
The Council is optimistic about the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. if the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tension on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also mentioned in the discussions, according to Mr Niinistö.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.
Finnair is cancelling 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot's closed for a couple of hours.
One flight is cancelled Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia is reported to have sought to manage airport operations during the stoppage by means of a supervisory force.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checks and other service points.
The protest closes down the streets of Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close down the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the railway yard will be closed to cars from about 9:30 to 2:00.
From the mainland, cars are not allowed on Mine Street, Post Street or Work Bay Street in the direction of the railway station.
From Union Street in Hakaniemi direction, traffic is directed to Union Street at the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
Police say the closing time depends on the number of people attending the rally.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and wheelchair drivers in the whole Friday demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will participate in the demonstration on Friday from the morning traffic until the night traffic.
The Metro and Tramway Employees Association reported it to STT last night.
Most of Alko will be closed for two hours, including post office closures.
Friday's demonstration will also disrupt the Postal Service.
Significant delays are expected, for example in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the post office's service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross is carrying out blood drives despite the strike.
The food transportation, hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also being handled.
The Post's website provides up-to-date information on the services provided.
Most of the Finnish Alps will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The Pam Service Union has instructed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 1:00.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to take part in the trade union demonstration.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanom that they are trying to keep the stores open, if necessary with the help of the superintendent.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
The Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports that the daycare centres in Helsinki will not be fully functional on Friday.
Due to the protest of professional organisations, daycare may be concentrated in certain day-care centres and club activities in day-care centres and playgrounds are not organised.
The 24-hour day care centres and the groups for children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities will remain open.
In addition, afternoons for students with developmental disabilities and autism are organized as normal.
The Early Childhood Education Agency promises to provide more information about the changes in operation tomorrow.
Media researcher: "The fly is taking a big risk"
According to the fly, communication requires a variety of channels, and the prime minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of direct communication will be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in the House.
The fly did not want to assess how often the repeated habit of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches comes.
According to the Owl, the talks may not always be broadcast on the Upper Channel.
If any other channels sign up, we'll watch it.
"Now, tonight, this channel is used", said the Owl.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio address to the citizens.
The whole of this is rather complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel. The Owl survived.
The talk will be broadcast at 9.05 p.m. and 21.20 p.m. on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at the National Arena.
The fly takes a big risk
A media analyst hopes that Owl's televised speech isn't a sign of a more general government turn inward.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define the public debate more firmly into one's own hands and to refuse to ask questions in the public debate?
I am reminded of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not let it define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related.
The dream is to understand that the commercial media is upset by the Owl's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not matters of publicity in a democracy.
The media's role is, by definition, to ensure that politicians' agendas are not taken for granted.
Koivus says that a television speech is a big risk for Sipil.
The fly should bring something new and special to the table when it speaks, in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there anything more on offer today than what we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Mr Koivunen says that if the promise is just another one of the same old ones, one has to wonder why such a big gesture was made and why the European Parliament gave it exceptional time.
It is also worth taking a risk in this sense, if it is not a special situation but a routine conversation among others.
The danger is that the EP will be branded as a message from politicians or from Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in the interests of the EP or in the general line.
A sly move by the mole
The media analyst points out that what the prime minister does not say is also important in the future speech of the ant.
In the evening, you should look closely at what the Sipilä is missing and what it is not, says research coordinator Heikki Kuutti of the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the six, the TV talk is a clever move by the Owl, because it allows him to express his own views without making a noise.
This is how you get a message to a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The whistle will bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger is that the media will misinterpret the speech because they will not be allowed to ask detailed questions.
According to the Six, it's very important how Owl appears on TV, whether he sweats, shakes his hands.
He compares the Owl to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If the Owl can make his case, it might work.
It is different from a government notification because it is as if one person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his associates do on a regular basis.
Really exceptional .
Political analyst Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
He said that it had not happened for decades that a prime minister spoke directly to the people.
"Exceptional times call for exceptional means", says Railo.
The researcher suggests that the Prime Minister wants to get the Finns to accept the blackmailing that is coming.
The unions are holding a protest and strike against the government's actions on Friday.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow discussion.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East.
This is no time for monologues.
It's almost six months before the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy who was on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was in good health when he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Finnish Police also confirms the situation to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, no contact was made.
Dad thanks everyone who helped him find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations over the past few hours.
The update was shared nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible amount in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed by youth violence: You're causing hate
Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, appealing specifically to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani made a powerful speech against street fights among young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC freestyle series so far.
Amirkani says he got a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos of teenagers fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the way the young are being driven wild.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick people on the ground, sit on top of each other and punch them without thinking about the consequences, what this will do when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
I mean, you guys are fighting on the street.
You are making it harder for many other immigrants to live here in Finland, Amirkhani, a Turk, reminds us.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland that look for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite a lot.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be strangers here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way of saying thank you for letting us be here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of racism, you can blame it on yourself.
Now, think twice before you go along with this, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You're creating a kind of hatred in the mosque that I don't like myself.
You're in pretty bad shape anyway, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK will take a position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employee organisation would consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings scheme proposed by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The STTK, a civil service centre, said earlier on Wednesday that it would submit its own proposal to the government to achieve the five percent productivity cut demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the agreement to include the following areas:
However, this would require the biggest employer organisation, SAK, to soften its position.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a brief comment on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK working committee will consider the matter on Monday.
Lylly said that the SAK is looking for solutions to 'open the labour market' and that instead of compulsory laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly recalls that the proposal for a social contract from the Prime Minister Sipilä's government did not suit SAK.
The company had previously broken off the negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: "The big protest is about to go down - " "Does it feel a little funny to wear a fist?"
It feels a little weird to punch when you already have the settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood varies from camp to camp.
Is this about screaming for the government to go down, or is this about making a deal with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK alliance erupted in holy rage against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The threat would spread to the Akwa Ibom.
The teachers' union, OAJ, threatened to close schools and day care centers.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or day care centers will be closed completely.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (S), President of the STSC, made a conciliatory statement.
He said he had contacted the government and was preparing an alternative proposal for a five percent productivity gap, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Mr Sture Fjäder (Co-Chairman) was quick to announce that his agreement paper was ready.
At first, there was no word from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lylyn (S&D) is having a hard time agreeing when the leaders of the coalition just on Monday ordered the country to stand by on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's Labour Committee would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions to "open the labour market".
In order to create a common position among employees, SAK would have to accept a 5% productivity shift as a target.
No wonder the Palolan STTK has good relations with the Owl government.
The right-hand man of Palola, the head of the STTK responsible for social activism, Jukka Ihanus, was previously a special assistant to the central ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The report also points out that the government's skills have been steadily improving.
Coincidentally or not, the Palola exit took a bit of a hit off the Finnish stand-up comedians, whose flagship is the AKT's Marko Piirainen (sd).
I know it feels a little weird to pick a fist when you've got the settlement paper in your pocket.

Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticized the Helsinki Summit.
The Russian Duma speaker, Sergei Naryshkin, believes that Mongolia is a better host for the Etsy than Finland.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Republic of Latvia has begun in the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, where Mr Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July celebrations in Helsinki.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians such as Naryshkin, who were on the EU sanctions list, to attend the meeting - a point the President managed to remind journalists.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin was also criticised in the United States, where he was denied entry.
Sanctions are political suicide on the part of the EU, declared Naryshkin.
The Russian delegation made it to Mongolia without difficulty, so Naryshkin continued to taunt Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results, unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshk has met in Ulaanbaatar with the chairman of the meeting, Ilkka Kanerva (cook), who has already spoken with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
Lock will face the real playoff monster, "Scorers in tight".
Tappara and Lukko continue their bull days in Hakam forest today, with both of them on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicted that there will be no real painting festival in Hakamets today.
Tappara went to Kuopia yesterday to win the 3-2 series against Kalpa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was at its worst from a two-goal deficit.
Tuesday was a lot more lucrative.
The Ravens' catch with the Blues coming off a strong start was a round zero, and the losses were 2-3.
Tough game, tight goals, if they play at all the same game as last year, Lock forward Janne Lahti anticipates the settings on the team's sidelines.
The killer has become a playoff nightmare for the Raumians.
Tappara has been in the middle of the pack in the last two seasons, and it's just the final of the Luko series.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been required to settle.
Last season, Lukko broke the series in the fourth game, but Tappara got up in the next three and passed.
There are no major changes in the line-up, except for the goalkeepers.
Both cashiers, rejected yesterday, are being promoted to the top of the table today.
On the mating field, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Bear, and between the lock-sticks, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsky.
Point of view: the aces are in for a nasty treat .
Sports director Toivola wrote a script for a sequel that was inappropriate for head coach Rautakalliou, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
The underdogs have sensationally put the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, on the field.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he ended up losing the title game.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a script for the restless ash story of Pori.
The unnamed, knife-wielding bat pack surprised everyone by qualifying for the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of unnamed but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Peltos.
In the fall games, players dyed their heads red and cut off their irokises.
Hope turned into a blonde.
The great TV host, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The ace took the silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this season's remake will work the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the Athletic Director for the Aces has built a pot of cash on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been kicking ass at guys in the long-distance like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than playing on a reel.
Hope has forgotten that Rocky VI stars Big Iron Rock.
Carrie Stone has been christened Iron Horse Sean Connery.
Iron Fist is the same clumsy lead in Toyola's Rocky as Connery would have been in the original 1976 film.
There's nothing in the Iron Curtain but Rocky, nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Curtain is not about running and playing small.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, the Aces' Garret Stafford knocked Tappara's Jere Karelia in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play the ones who deserve it.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not an ace game. The hot iron rock, after the game, was a wake-up call to the Hundred Nation.
The Aces this season are a weird team.
There's the nerds, the vets, the cops, the bodybuilders.
There are practically no key men of prime playing age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill shortage.
How much of an impact have you had on the player's trades, Big Iron?
The events of the last season affect procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather tight, Irutakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a lot of dust underneath.
The 1953 model Iron Dome is reportedly interested in moving to the Toivola site as a sports venue.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The Aces have lost three league games this season, the same number of losses, 1-6.
I don't think Hope should have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen will play the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under her husband's direction.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
It kind of feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughing.
She has been married to Apulanã's ex-bassist and conductor Tuukka Temes since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but this is the first time Olga is acting under Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, which tells about the early years of Apulan, is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuki, Sirkka.
Sirkka chants and supports her son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my real role model, Sirkka, the easier it seems to me to play the part.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
The shark has been a big help.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the biggest band in Finland.
It was the '90s, the recession, and it was really bad.
There was a pretty slim chance that anyone would actually succeed, but Sirca had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard much from Tuuka about his youth even before the film plans.
But the stories of the parents have been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know what you're talking about?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, Heinola's infamous skater.
Olga was an old and kind girl who would have had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
The best he could do is secretly fall in love.
Olga says she's worked so much with Tuuka over the last 10 years that she's not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything's always been going super well.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple in Itia will often drive home overnight for their young children, since the distance is not too long.
We'll take the whole of Heinola for a month.
They've given us a very warm welcome, just asking which streets and when they're going to clear.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive Finnish drama film
The budget of the film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
We start filming in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is set to become Finland's most expensive drama film of all time with a budget of €17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been held by Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The upcoming Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2 after completion, with a budget of over 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaan, will begin filming in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of a huge budget.
I've been sick and tired!
I'm so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
No matter how tight the time is, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this film to the public, he tells the Evening Post.
The film was originally budgeted at 8 to 10 million, but as the script developed, the budget grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story too.
But you could get 100 million into the movie because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything's twisted so tightly, there's not a single loose end.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Wednesday, and a bond loan, which pays an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final rate will be determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
The company will repay the loan within two years.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov, among others.
Junt or cool?
Big logos are coming back on the shirts.
The trendsetters' headlines have been decorated with big logos lately.
Not long ago, the fashion-conscious dressed man avoided large, clear logos like Crocs in a crown.
Advertising a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as somewhat of a fad.
But times change.
Sport has become a true fashion mega-trend, and so have old, familiar sportswear brands like Adidas and Nike risen to the brim of cool.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already really cool, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First, there was the norm core trend, where the trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothing as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the basic gray collar, they put on the web-shirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer's logo on the front.
The bigger, the more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, the iconic Adidas striped shirts, the shirts of their favorite teams and the New York Yankees tickets have also made a comeback.
The Calvin Klein logos on the edge of the jeans, the underwear that makes you laugh, are a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn sweaters makes it clear what type of clothing is involved.
Would you be willing to show off your logos in your outfit?
A Russian politician released proof that I wasn't stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
The allegations were that an unusual incident occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held, which showcased Russian military products.
In recent days, the Russian media have spread colorful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to detach the large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his public Facebook page, showing him peering into the hatch of an armored vehicle in a rather good mood and at least according to the pictures there is no trapped or angry feeling.
It's full of crap.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the tank. It was a BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm an ex-soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around, and came out calmly, Zotov told Pravda Komsomolskaja.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian military television that he was fascinated by the exhibition of new Russian technology because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriages, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the backpack, he said.
I've been to every tank in the world.
And at the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One of the fools wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
"I'm tall and slender, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, nothing like that happened", he told Russian radio station sluzhba novotei.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged entrapment have been published, although the exhibition was visited by a total of 50,000 people in a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's entrapment originated from a story on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told to flinch as he tried to get out of the tank hatch and threatened to eventually shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a sequel in which the exhibition organizers shared their own view of what had happened.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, because of his size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.
This is a favorite item of interior bloggers.
The 1962 Lassen nail by architects Viljesten Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks as if it were designed today.
A cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that's what it was originally.
Architectural polishes are known to refine the shape of the nail for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was initially presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the gentlemen.
Kubus is manufactured by the family-owned company By Lassen, which has maintained the design heritage of the famous brothers.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked into the ditch from what is called the richness pool.
The company says that the leak has been remediated.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment foam and purified process water from the foaming process.
The water is usually either pumped for reuse as process water or, as permitted, discharged into the environment via a surface-level field.
The estimated volume of the leak was about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
The company claims that the quality of the leakage is in line with the current permit requirements.
No other material was released into the environment.
The leak was detected on a rounds of inspection Monday morning.
No structural damage to the pool's support structures has been detected.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and rectify the situation.
The mine employs about 600 permanent workers.
Danish Bank: IMF warns against cutting too much
The report on Finland's land, published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), largely reflects the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation has been pioneering structural reforms across Finland to overcome the economic problems.
The IMF believes that reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contract system and in unemployment protection.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäen, chief economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages about government action, but also contains a warning about what should not be cut too much.
This is the case, for example, with infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to T Ekonomijsonoom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today, in its new relationship forecast, forecast growth to be zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They could have been based on the latest findings.
This morning the Statistical Office reported that total production had been growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
The Commission has also been able to draw less attention to the weakening of industrial confidence or to other so-called softer measures.
However, the differences are only a few percent of the decimal point.
Nintendo has appointed a new CEO
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata had been at the helm of Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were brought up as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima's task is seen as bringing Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but not eating the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minors seeking asylum are arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency admitted that up to hundreds of children who have arrived in the country disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year, according to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others.
The Chief Inspector of the Immigration Office, Juha Kannelmaa, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many asylum seekers go "underground" every year? - In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made by minors who came alone.
Nine of them are missing.
In 2014, 196 such applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, reports Kannelmaa.
The disappearance may be caused by the fact that the proceedings reveal that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been, if necessary, declared to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of those who disappear are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3,651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were dismissed on the grounds that the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from minors who have come alone.
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the EU's financial markets, which is a major source of uncertainty for the EU.
What about those who have made the decision to convert?
Are they also disappearing into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess at the Immigration Office, as the police are responsible for enforcing return decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (K) has expressed concern about the growing number of unregistered asylum seekers.
He's been working on it.
The European Union is also committed to the implementation of the European Union's common foreign and security policy.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A. ' s studio online . See the pictures of the equipment .
The equipment used by media entrepreneur Timo T.A. Mikkos for TV and radio productions, who lost his ability to work because of illness, is now for sale.
Mikkosen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced tools for professionals in its field.
The first online publication I heard about the ad was in my evening magazine.
Today, much of the equipment is stuck in the technological development.
In the digital media world, you don't record TV shows on Betacam tapes anymore.
But Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interest.
Of course, the equipment is no longer so up-to-date, but it is still needed as long as there is an old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is because the Mikkos are looking to move out of their current home in the Hurricane.
There's no way we can take all the merchandise with us.
I've been doing a little inventory, looking at what's being given away.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
No more use for TVs and radios.
It's clear from the aftermath of his recent stroke that a man with a long career will never return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now we only sell goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkos's real life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box store to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic is at risk of deterioration, with the subway and tram stopping all Friday
Metro and tram drivers are deciding today whether to expand their enforcement efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to halt subway and tram traffic only for the Friday demonstration.
The afternoon will decide whether or not traffic will stop for the rest of the day.
Chief of staff, Pekka Hirvonen, says there's a big threat on the field.
Night and shift cuts are a major drag on drivers, so government plans to cut down the lions are facing opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area will be almost completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not run on Fridays between 6am and 6pm.
Friday, there's no traffic in or out.
Trains departing before midnight will be driven to their destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left behind.
The members of the ACP-EEC Committee are absent from work from 3 a.m. on Friday to 3 a.m. on Saturday.
A small number of buses are likely to be driven, driven by the driver, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo believes.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly what bus routes will run on Friday.
The employer organisations are holding a grand rally at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday from 11am to 1pm.
Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred near the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to get ahead into Europe, reports the AP news agency.
Sky News has reported that the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of them women and children, fled in a panic.
Local media reported that Hungarian police had also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas . The teacher thought the homemade clock was a bomb .
In Texas, U.S.A., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after a teacher held a homemade watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the profits from his electronics business.
One of the teachers, however, kept the clock exactly like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the juvenile detention center.
At no point has Muhammad been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it's possible that the boy could be charged with making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found the watch to look like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished by three days of school leave.
Her father is furious about the case, and the country's American-Islamic Council is considering whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is getting better - Labour leader refuses to sing the national anthem
The song is a plea to God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has been echoed by Corbyn's own Labour MPs.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and stresses that he showed his respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We are all deeply indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement said.
Corbyn's election as party leader has split Labour.
There are those in Parliament who fear that he will drive out moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament for the first time as party leader for the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what questions he should ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted at the weekend about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is a threat to our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family murder remains unclear . The father of the family was awaiting trial .
The South Lake Minnetonka Police Department is investigating a week-long family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a few days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with his first shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of his house.
Dead for days .
The family was found after a school worries about missing children.
Based on this report, the police went to the house for a search and found the Short family dead on all sides of a huge house.
According to Star Tribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millionaire House and Successful Business
The investigation into the death of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Sitari is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed remains unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful businessman who had made his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com, which was geared toward nurses.
In a 2014 interview with Star Tribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors each week.
I've had 50 offers to buy the company in the last 10 years.
I've abandoned all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe I'll sell the company at some point, but not yet.
One of the things that helped them succeed was that in 2011, the Short family bought a modest home in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate website Zillows as the dream of a car collector: not only does it have 12 rooms, but it also has a garage for eight cars.
The case is pending
But according to Star Tribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers a variety of prep courses, had sued her over comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short's website had not removed comments insulting the prep courses and as a result they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to Star Tribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.

"The greatest donation ever made by an athlete".
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital press release, this is the largest single donation to charity in Canada by an athlete.
In addition, Subban, 26, has committed to assisting the hospital with other funding for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation is significantly larger than his annual income of $9 million.
In return for his donation, Subban will receive a hall bearing his name from the hospital.
The Canadiens have had a history of helping local hospitals.
A year ago, the late longtime captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum for another major city hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
A Japanese cafe can be ordered for a wife's dinner, serves food in nothing but bikinis and a scarf.
Teahouses are a tough thing in Japan.
There's goat coffee, rabbit coffee, vampire coffee, brownie coffee, and now wife coffee.
It's going to hit the lonely, the sociable, the hungry.
Metro is reporting on it.
The Tokyo Ore no Yome (My Wife) Cafe is a place where you can order your own wife or husband's evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "husband" is selected from the list before entering the cafe, and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is wearing a skirt and a bikini, and the husband is wearing tight-fitting biking shorts.
The website provides candidates with all the information they need, from height and weight to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected: The car security attack is being prepared
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a press release issued by Intel.
The board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
The ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and audits with the aim of standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of its cybersecurity best practices.
The company will update the report in the future based on the findings of the ASRB.
The global ICT research and consultancy firm Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate shows that 60 to 75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
The ASRB will enable Intel to establish best practices in security and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been a monthly highlight for years.
Finally, the car is starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the eyes of the automotive world are on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-cylinder RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds with its 2.3-liter 350-horsepower engine and reaches a top speed of 175 miles per hour (266 km/ h).
The price is also of interest in Finland, with a preliminary figure of EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for order, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
The popular Kia brand presented two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and the Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two new Finnish models, with which Kia intends to capture a larger share of the ever-growing market for street cars.
The Sportage, designed by the new European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more round than before.
The wheelbase and outer axles have become an inch and an inch and the car is now more efficient in its airflow.
The engine range is essentially the same, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine producing 177 horsepower.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the price of the new Kia Sporttag.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we're getting the new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimus arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia is going to win the hearts of upper-middle class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
The Optimo will start with a 1.7-litre turbocharged diesel engine and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when they are joined by the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine.
At the same time as it arrives, Optima Farmer will be on sale.
Chisu returned to the stage, bursting into a bold, garish look.
Singer Chisu is performing at the Life for a Child concert with other local stars.
The blue suit has a prominent, open neck hole.
The costume is a beautiful display of the singer's slim waist.
The whole thing is crowned with a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer-mother has shed the weight of her pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one.
The singer released her first single from the new album in August.
I'm not really excited about getting back on stage and in front of a big crowd after a long break.
"I've missed everything musically related", the singer says.
Chisu is releasing his new and fourth album in a couple of weeks called Polaris.
Your new life situation has inspired me to write new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people will find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian's motherly style is stunning again. Now you can see her breasts.
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian is giving one talk after another.
She's showing off her pregnancy and breasts in sexy clothes, most recently last night at 1:00 AM US time, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian and her husband Kanye West for a concert.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It'll reveal the skin-colored bras underneath the dress in the flash of lightning.
The last time Kardashian wore her fancy maternity suit was at a dinner party at her friend's house in New York just a few days ago.
The black boots of the upper generation emphasized the look.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last Friday when the show was full of pregnant women.
The hardest rules of the modeling world: no home, you're lonely, the competition is fierce
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to narrow down the idea of the modeling world as a pure glamour and champagne party.
She made her own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and her colleagues talk openly about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar has compiled six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
While last season you were posing in the costumes of top designers, this new season is starting again with castings.
And every season, there's a new, fresh face in the industry, competing for the job with the big boys.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is a constant journey and may take years, with the accommodation being a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses house their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most desirable jobs, but they're the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to lose weight, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a gamble.
At Fashion Week, models and designers are always together, and they also act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the separation is a little bit of a hassle.
Models want to be in the business because of the opportunities it offers, but they are tainted by the fact that everyone thinks the job is just a display of clothes.
Models want to be their own person.
It makes the models feel like they're actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of modeling.
The models at the Tory Burch show last night.
New York is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers are unveiling their next year's lineup.
Roope Salminen , who changed his style , will play the most unknown musician of the Apulanta in the film .
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the band's founder, in the film based on the early years of the Apulanta group.
The singer founded Apulannan in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but left the group in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me, because I'm about to turn 26 as a rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've been trying to avoid meeting the real Ant before filming because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the least known to the public, so I think it's a good thing I'm learning his playing style just from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a human.
A man who trusts the Roope Salmon and Dogs Association on a whim will not be cast.
Punk manners are a man's nature.
I'm sure many of you saw the first episode of the punk-punk episode of "Stars, Stars", as well as those who have ever been to our shows.
Our gigs have never been anything short of a road trip, but we always go full steam ahead.
The main actors of the movie "You're Beautiful" directed by Tuukka Temes, who played bass in the band from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is played by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the public.
The drummer Sipe Santapukkia is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasa from Tatu Sinisalo and bassist Tuukka Temos from Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming gig last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat he was preparing for the biggest day of his career.
Roope has already posted a picture on Instagram yesterday of his new look, which he has had to do for the film.
Roope, seen in the moustache and leather jacket before, has turned his face into silos, and dyed his brown hair black.
This is how you tell your kids about refugees.
Many parents have had to wonder in recent days how to tell their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
It is not necessary to force the issue, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Younger children are to be protected, for example, by not letting them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can be mind-boggling and distressing, he says.
However, if a child has seen news pictures of refugees on television or has heard about them from other sources, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to start a conversation about the child's background and listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may come as a surprise.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're worried and scared.
A younger child closely observes the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will feel secure.
Older children are more likely to encounter discussions about refugees at school, with their friends, or on the Internet.
Parents do well to discuss the matter with them if the child is thinking.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents can discuss with their children how this is done in our family.
But is the world, after all, a safe place or an unsafe place?
Parents may also have different views on parenting - some may want to protect their children from distress as much as possible.
On the other hand, if difficult matters are discussed in the family, the child will be given a model for how to deal with the difficulties that come his way.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
You're out of power?

The ball is hitting Vermo , hard to contain .
Perttu Pohjola was honed in the middle of summer to support the Apilan Balloslam.
It was only winning and finishing second, until the Tampere rave collapsed at the end of July.
Because of the deep-seated anger, the trainer suspected something was wrong and ordered a protective time from the vet.
The explanation for the blackout came out in the blink of an eye.
The horse had strep throat.
The disease was not mild, but it required two courses of medication to be controlled.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to do light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE pool in Turku in its record time after Taruntuul.
Apilla's ball-and-socket was under a lot of stress during the break, having been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, the slight slope at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
Coach assumes that a good competition gave the Ori a blade.
The horse's turn must have gone ahead of it, and hopefully it would have evened out too.
Apilla's Balls have been the so-called humor horses.
When it's not been enjoyed, it could have been thrown to fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, a sign has broken from the ori, so that opposers have been amazed.
At short speeds, competitors cannot make the Ballroom, from which even warm-blooded rides emerge.
The North wants a fencing run in Vermont.
But it's different how Apilan Ball Lake agrees to it.
It's kind of hard when you're going out and you might get a lot of spikes under the bumper of the car and stuff.
I hope the Ori are calmer than when Tur left.
Apilla's bowling alley can come out of the bowling alley when it's fit, and we're going to drive it for the win, Coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone apps.
Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple's iPhones may be removed at some point in the future - but not all.
Apple may plan to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, CEO Tim Cook told Buzzfeed magazine.
The iPhone has a number of applications that are relatively unused: FaceTime, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Wink.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a mandatory update to the iPhone, although it is only needed by Apple's smartwatch owners.
Cook says that deleting Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some of the apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If you remove them, it could cause problems on another phone somewhere, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications work in conjunction with other applications.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So Cook says Apple is looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste memory on people's iPhones.
Euro area inflation fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, by 0.1% year-on-year, the EU's statistical office Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by the cheapening of energy.
Eurostat thus revised downwards from its preliminary estimate of 0.2% a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
The EU-28 had a zero average inflation rate in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
Of the euro area countries, Malta recorded the highest increase in consumer prices in August, at 1.4%.
Cyprus had the lowest rate of inflation at 1.9% in the period of falling prices.
In Finland, inflation was negative at 0.2% according to the EU's harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains firmly at the bottom of the European Central Bank's (ECB) mediumterm inflation target of 2%.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year, the rate will rise to 1.1%, as the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The US Fed is next trying to tighten monetary policy .
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely in three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, begins its long-standing interest rate hike.
And in the financial markets, the downturn will begin before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may begin interest rate hikes as early as this week and no later than the end of the year.
The next recession could hit at its fastest by next autumn and the financial markets could be in a recession before then.
Or at least that's what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they have always done and if they react to the Fed's money-laundering as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, market strategists at Deutsche Bank London, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who prepared the study and the report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen to the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after the Fed rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they examine which key economic and financial market variables are now in the same or different pattern as at the time of previous rate hikes - and what may result.
Clearly, both the economy and the financial markets are now more resilient to rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950's.
The recession may not even start in a year.
The leaders of monetary policy and the Fed's monetary policy have been suggesting throughout the summer and early summer that the time is ripe for a rise in interest rates.
The first rate hike in over nine years could be this week.
The matter will be decided on Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed's so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds rate was in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but small rate hikes of 0.25 percentage points over two years, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market crisis began in 2007 with the most risky housing financing crisis in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, the serious contraction in financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically been the case since the Fed raised interest rates in the past.
Similarly, the trials were harder and more severe than at any time since the depression of the 1930's.
Deutsche's strategists have been filtering the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and the turns of financial markets since the 1950s and in places since the early 19th century.
They've been backing the Fed's rate hikes and their economic and financial effects since the 1950s.
At the fastest, the time from the first recession to the start of the recession is less than a year, usually less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The financial market is closed within two years of the start of the Fed rate hike.
The Fed has raised and lowered its policy rate since the early 1950s for a dozen different cycles.
Each time has differed somewhat from the others, and the factors are relatively small in scope, so that it is hardly possible to draw any definite conclusions on the effects of the subsequent rate increases.
The strategists remind us that this time, a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Decades of research may not unquestionably reveal the root causes of the financial crisis and the perpetrators.
But three things about the causes of the crisis and the reasons for its destructive effects are probably somewhat undeniable:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other major central banks of the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They were repairing the traces of the tech plane, and growing the next one.
2) The excessive amount of debt accumulated over the decades in various parts of the financial and real economy was further increased by excessive monetary policy by the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history was born.
3) The crazy cheap debt financing, which was packed with the most precious assets in the financial economy in particular, inflated most parts of the financial markets into the largest exchange-rate bubbles in the history of the economy, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly a hard-hitting argument that financial markets, which have risen to the top under increasingly complex debt levers, were in a rare dangerous and volatile position when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures, which were adjusted to the debt ceiling, and even the valuation bubbles, only lasted for a time after the interest rate increases had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned upward.
The risks came in the financial crisis, followed by the Great Recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
The German strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of the debate a hint by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even more relaxed for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have been even lower for a longer period.
(2) Borrowing has long since been less insanely cheap than it was ten years ago, and now, at its cheapest, debt is literally cheaper than free.
The debt burden in the financial and real economies has not eased, but is now much heavier in various parts of the economy than before the financial crisis or almost ever before.
3) The liquidity from formerly more liquid and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial markets, pushing key securities and assets to their highest levels since the pre-financial crisis peak or ever.
And not only do strategists warn the mood in financial markets, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has yet to recover from the financial crisis and its worst recession in decades.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the financial market pressures and risks are correspondingly unprecedentedly greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts to tighten its monetary policy.
Perhaps the future of French bank Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it suddenly seems.
He has been training the bank's international investment clients for quite some time in the following full Fed translations:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubble bursts, and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to extinguish the financial fires with even greater QE monetary strikes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be in HP's corporate services segment, the company said.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprises, which focuses on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP's workforce peaked in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records one-off costs of USD 2,7 billion (approximately EUR 2,4 billion) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprises is going to be cutting between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs.
The reductions on the consumer side will be 3300 over three years.
HP intends to move its operations to low-cost countries, with 60% of its workforce in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its turnover.
In another year, its three most important customers accounted for 65% of its turnover.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system for your iPhone after Apple releases the update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking on General, and then selecting Software Update.
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after this installation, when they have seen the error message "Software update failed".
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic to pass or try to update via the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user through the final process.
This may include removing apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests removable apps and then re-installs them when the update is complete.
It is advisable to ensure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery is running out in the middle, it could lead to the update being broken.

General: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Anne Berner (Central), has been a member of the board of directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities were linked to so-called tax planning.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Mr Berner himself says he resigned from the Commission in May of this year.
I checked it out, and I've just left a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the chain of registration takes place on the agreed schedule, Berner says in the interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted to the Finnish State in the form of a grant of EUR [...] million.
Berner was on the board of Karelia Upper Floor between 2010 and 2013 and on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company after the merger.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg are governed by a multi-tiered ownership structure.
Berner tells Yelle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of directors of Karelia Upper Floor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted by a partner in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to see that the capital interests of a Finnish family company were realized.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yale that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not tied to tax planning.
According to Mr Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax havens is due to the fact that the capital fund Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
A company-run reception centre opens in Espoo
The first enterprise-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to accept the first 100 residents starting tonight.
The capacity can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Immigration Office will establish a reception centre on the premises of the former Salvation Academy.
The activities are carried out by Luona Oy, which is principally engaged in the provision of healthcare and nursing services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy have agreed on security arrangements for the centre.
The STTK is preparing an alternative work-life blackmail package
The STTK is preparing an alternative package to the government's blackmailing of working people.
The organisation also wishes to involve other central wage-earning organisations.
President Antti Palola said that the focus was on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways to reduce the cost of labour will be reviewed afterwards.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, Palola told reporters during the break from the organization's board meeting.
Palola believes that the Central Business Union (CE) is not ready for discussions.
STTK's economists have calculated that the change guarantee included in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, whereas the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for conversation when there's a one-to-one ratio.
Palola: The negotiating relationship was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternatives by Wednesday, when the government is due to deliver a package notice to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
The fire department didn't take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Union's external action programme.
The staff centre organisation for the STTK field, especially the Sunday-night cutting, is a painful place, according to Palola.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the compulsory legislation with which it would be implementing some of the blackmail.
The STCK, according to Palola, is not warming up to the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP which put the matter forward.
The workers will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest the government's blackmail package on working life presented last week.
The package includes a cut in the first sick days, a halving of overtime pay, a reduction of Sunday pay to 75% and a shortening of holidays.
The STTK stresses that the central organizations have called for a demonstration of the wage earners and that the intention was not to organize a strike.
The Fjäder of Akavan thanks you
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the EU's financial markets.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now on the same page as Aqaba, as an alternative model for government proposals has already been formulated in Aqaba.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without the SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
The President of Akava, Mr Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, headed by Mr Lauri Lylyn, will come to prepare a proposal on alternatives to cuts.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
We want change insurance and time banks.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and the European Fisheries Fund (EFF).
The Commission has always been willing to negotiate and we have been writing an alternative model for the government's proposals for a long time.
We're willing to consider the terms of service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want security for change and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also join the Aqaba lines, as the STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to create a model that will benefit the government and employers, says Fjäder.
The Akwa Working Committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, talc" playing bingo while the Owl talks at night

Vivan's bingo cup for the evening, from the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
Prime Ministers have made extraordinary speeches in the past during the Mtshala Uprising and other wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation on the state of the Finnish economy on Wednesday night at 9.05pm on the Ylen Channel.
If you want to find a similar speech by a previous prime minister, you have to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was prime minister and gave the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mandzála rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers made several radio speeches during the winter and post-war years.
In the 1990s, President Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the railway strike in a televised speech.
The monopoly, the monarchist mentality
The ant's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day about what's to come.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a statement by the prime minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Green Party's Ville Niinistö, "the one-to-one call has already been seen.
Leadership is about dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist sentiment: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
The SDP chairman, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "It is six months since the elections.
Not one appearance as Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We tried.
What is @juasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the State Council's office, Owl's speech is pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the comments were made by the SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and the CEO of EK, Jyri Häkämies, during the live broadcast.
I've been criticized for giving the Owl speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service's task to promote publicity across Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Publications at YLE in YLE News.
Like we did in the days of the Tameloes
The speech has also attracted ridicule.
When evening comes, the children are given a proper evening meal, combed and dressed to their finest.
Mommy puts on the prettiest collar and Dad fits the tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, the television is silent as it was in the old days of Me Tammeloes", writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain why the Finnish government has millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens, who are drafting amnesty laws for their tax-evading friends and at the same time telling the people that they have to cut back when the state runs out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the green leftist Viva of the University of Tampere.
It's posted a Facebook post with a bingo.
Tonight, we're gonna hear about the same boat, the same coal, the same debt, the same team spirit.
The coupons and the pens are ready, at 9:05 p.m. it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russian proposal to oust al-Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rejected an offer by Russia to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to the newspaper, the Russian UN envoy proposed a plan to remove al-Assad from power in a graceful manner after a while.
The Western countries, however, did not accept the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
The Russian ambassador, Vitali Tshurkin, told him in a private conversation that the three-point plan was to prevent the opposition from arming itself, that there should be an immediate dialogue between the opposition and Assad, and that Assad's resignation should be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can have an open discussion.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, "Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we need to do", Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting
Ahtisaari says he passed on Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm to the newspaper the content of the discussion, but Ahtisaari said there are no two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Mr Ahtisaari's claims, but said that at that time, al-Assad's forces had already carried out a number of mass killings and that key opposition groups had rejected any agreements to keep him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East department at the British Foreign Office, is skeptical of Mr Ahtisaari's remarks, because in his experience Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point of Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke to the Moscow delegation.
If he had told me about the speech by Tshurkin, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was still a plot by Putin to keep power with some al-Assad backer.
A refugee stream of our own making
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been displaced by war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We're paying the bill we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari tells the paper.
The centre for asylum seekers in Turkey
The centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tower complex in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki news agency reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a temporary solution to the ministry.
According to the deputy chairman of the Tornio city council, Sauli Hyöppinen (left), this is not true.
"When the whole council wasn't there and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter", he told STT.
36 out of 43 delegates were present at the debate.
The planning center was opposed by 13 councilors.
On this basis, a positive decision could be expected, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiaisen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
The consortium is estimated to accommodate 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be used for this purpose.
The location is a few hundred metres from the border, so it would be functional in that sense, says Rise.
The flea still hopes for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), the halving of public holiday funds would only address part of the government's aim of reducing the price of work.
He said the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners could agree on one.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were seeking alternatives to the government's announced blackmail of working people.
If such an agreement is to be made, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, a halving of the holiday allowance would be an effective way of doing so, since it would affect almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday hours.
The social partners could agree on the reduction of holiday allowances, since they are recorded in collective agreements instead of in the law.
The Government will present its views on the situation in the workplace next Wednesday in a communication from the Council of Ministers.
The fly says the proposals from the organizations should be known before then.
The final back line is not here either.
The legislative work will then start, which means the train is moving and it will become more and more difficult.
It's about time.
It doesn't take long to get to this kind of thing, if you have the will, the Owl designed it.
The list published by the Government last week includes the change from the end of the year and from the friday to the unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working time.
In addition, the first sick days are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation beyond trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
The wage-earners' organisations are holding a rally on Friday in response to the action, and several trade unions have announced political strikes.
The Tohma Lake City Council approved the expansion of the Mahlahall warehouse.
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved the expansion of the hall, or the storage hall, of the slightly weaker Nordic Koivu Oy.
The criticism was that the project is larger and more expensive than originally envisaged.
I'm also a little bit on a tight schedule.
It was also a little surprising that the space requirement was not known a year ago when the last enlargement was decided.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400 to 450 m2 was approved for the investment programme, but the financial amount will be decided on in the interim report.
The agenda also mentioned an investment of EUR 150 000 to 200 000 but at the meeting technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it would bring jobs and tax revenue to the local area.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) argued.
The language of the Karelian people has a place in Joensuu
The city government eased its previously harsh stance to bring karay language cotton signs to Joensuu's downtown.
The new decision is important and right in view of the continuing herding tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karelian language because it has no historical basis and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more closely related to the Eastern Savoyards.
After the new decision, there will be no more signage in the city center in the Karelian language.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, well prepared to use the Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended by the city for all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worthwhile to be open-minded about the use of the Karayla language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in Northern Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a distinctive feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used to promote the county in a variety of ways.
The disruption of rail links is cutting off the province 's vitality .
The railway cuts are a major blow to the county's vitality.
The transport links have a direct impact on the economic and competitive situation of the region.
And that affects whether people can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also mentions air transport, which has been repeatedly included in the report.
It is important for the whole region that our chances of success are not reduced by state measures, as is happening now.
The impact of these disconnections on employment, for example, should be looked at, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport links poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the research community, which is highly mobile and travels a lot for research.
The University's recruitment director, Marko Junkkarinen, says that even at the moment it is difficult to market the university to Western Finland because of the weakness of the transport links.
At present, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of these, about 10-20% are from the Udelta region, partly because of the direct rail link.
From the river I became one of the voices of the war of the swine
The view of the Joensuu City Council on the provincial Siun Sode project is apparently unanimous, but there is one voice among the others.
At the council meeting on Monday, Pentti Keskisalo (pictured) proposed abandoning the whole project, but his proposal was deemed unprofitable.
The government approved Mayor Kari Karjalaisen's final proposal, which will be reviewed in early October before the city council meeting, which will give its final opinion on the project at the same time as all the other municipalities.
One train from the Eagle to Kouvola will end next year .
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, albeit with one less train shift.
Passenger train services between Kotka and Kouvola will change in March.
One couple of trains are left out, but you still get from the Eagle to Kouvola five times a day and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' purchase allowance for rail transport for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12,3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely shut down.
The VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up the roof, one didn't make it down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue team released a 12-year-old boy from the spire after he climbed onto the roof, who could not get down on his own.
The incident happened at Tornion Hill on Keto Road at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no stairs to the roof.
That did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the amateur radio mast next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away, and passersby alerted the rescue service to help with the stakes to bring back to the surface the last person left safely on the roof.
FedEx's operating profit is double, reducing its fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported depressing results for its most recent quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year earnings forecast, due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says it expects its fiscal year ending next May to be $10.40 to $10.90, which is 20 cents lower than previously forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet poll.
The lower outlook came despite average price increases of 4.9%, which will take effect on 4 January, and despite higher additional charges for heavy or large parcels by land starting in November.
The company said that it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year as they have cut costs, sales have increased and e-commerce is growing.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company was performing "stably in the face of weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday payroll plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it planned to hire 90-95 000 temporary workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ended 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share came in at $2.42, which is below the $2.44 average forecast.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Zacks interviewed six analysts who were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transport operations, which has halted the development of its Express business.
However, the rise of online trading has improved the results of the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the unit increased by 29%, but the operating income remained essentially the same due to the high costs of larger packages and the own insurance.
The revenue of the Express unit was better due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labour costs.
At the opening bidding, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
FedEx closed Tuesday with an 11 percent decline for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
The decision-makers of the Federal Reserve will sit around a huge potluck for two days this week in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the policy rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's ornate two-story meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the president of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the nation's financial interests ahead of everything else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank: to maximize U.S. employment and to keep prices stable.
But since the Great Depression, central bankers have accepted that there is a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third requirement may be the decisive factor in a decision to be announced on Thursday, one so severe that it is impossible to even predict whether the US economy is ready to withdraw from the record stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
While most data points to steady growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made already wary central bank officials more alarmed about the possibility of increased instability, fearing the effect of raising the federal funds rate by even a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important things to be monitored", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for keeping interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in the world market is a good enough reason to wait", he says.
The central bank's decision has not been agreed upon, which is already causing economic nervousness.
According to a recent Bloomberg survey, about half of the economists are predicting interest rates to rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the lifting, as the key indicator shows a growth potential of only about 30%.
This suggests a downturn in the stock market should the central bank raise the level, unless decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next raise will not take place anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to a new high of 16,599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would maintain the level this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now", he says.
If policy makers raise interest rates, they must put a lot of effort into their policies to support the financial markets so that they do not panic.
Other experts argue that the higher level would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago it seemed that the central bank would raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary environment that would ensure the stability of the American recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects levels to rise this year despite the Liberals' demands for more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers to be the threshold for full employment.
The rise in wages has shown signs of uplift.
Although inflation is still below the ECB's annual target of 2%, the ECB's decision-makers say that this is due to the temporary effect of a significant drop in oil prices.
The economy "can and needs higher interest rates in the face of the tight labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared that China's slowdown would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow is now almost 10 percent below its peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turbulence is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells when to raise interest rates.
"Without these financial market developments and the recent news coverage of China's weak economy, policymakers would be tightening the bar at this meeting", says Stephen D. Oliner, a senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still rather unclear, and they have little information available on the consequences of events in China", Oliner says.
The well-being of the international economy is not a central bank's primary concern and should therefore not, in principle, influence its decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the then-chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested that the central bank could "slow" the increase in money supply, causing a worldwide market upheaval.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly redirected, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that the Fed has in the past overreacted to financial market movements that have seemed detached from the fundamentals of the economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes the decisions, has called for an interest rate increase, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings, "despite its limited, identifiable impact on U.S. economic growth", says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank cancelled these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritize financial stability during a major crisis, such as the market crash of 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil is nowhere near that level, Posen says.
"Nobody wants to be in a situation where interest rate hikes are feared because the market is going to be upset", says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a twofold requirement, and it does not mention financial stability, and as long as that is the case, I don't think they should anticipate it.
You miss the great Thai store?
Try the LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in Chinatown
This store/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, often referred to as Thai Costco, is a Thai department store that also sells to private individuals.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The shop/warehouse is a one-stop shop offering a wide range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's even a car lot in the store if you need motor oil.
It's a huge store, and it takes over an hour to go around all the halls.
If the store makes you hungry, you can eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food booth inside the store (good, cheap) is near the boxes, and there are several take-out options.
What's in the inventory, do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C is probably selling it.
The products are reasonably priced and a large proportion of them are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The meat plate is large, and so is the fish plate, and the staff behind the counter will clean and file the fish and, if you want, fry it for you.
Much of the store is reserved for a huge freezer, where you can find frozen curry leaves, cucumber and galanga, whole ducks, fish, beef and pork, pork rind, fish balls, local sausages, snacks, and more.
Who goes to the store: restaurant owners and chefs, but also individual families and individuals.
I'm sure the corridors will be as good as the shopping carts and the trucks.
Fresh monthong duriot found by the cash register.
Where it's located: the store is in the factory district of Los Angeles, near Chinatown and downtown, just a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store may be busy, parking is usually easy to find.
Brazilian Pediatric Association in Rio Grande promotes healthy diets for breast-feeding mothers
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies breastfeeding with pictures of unhealthy food.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Channel Seven's Sunrise is a favorite in ratings, despite Nine's attempts to cover the executive's unveiling on the Today Show.
The rally by Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership unveiling failed to increase the number of viewers watching the broadcast.
The morning show on Channel Nine was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long international series, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the intermission did not seem to bother Australian viewers, with the average viewership for Sunrise in the five state capitals being 397,000, compared with 339,000 for Toad.
The average for the day rose slightly compared with the figures for Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Toy's average was 318,000 and Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers, compared with 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning in other places than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine. Thanks for asking.
Published on Monday 14 September 2015
The big news for Channel Seven was the 800-word series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing debut.
A new drama series, which has garnered a rather impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson is a force to be reckoned with in a popular series without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night gave him real certainty.
Channel Seven's The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Channel Seven had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new quiz show, presented by Andrew O'Keeffe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour, 17:30-18, reached 623,000 viewers, which was enough to beat Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers for the first half hour, and for the second half hour, a whopping 720,000.
The average Hot Seat was 620,000.
The second night of The Chase Australia's average viewership drop gives Nine confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce McGuire's ratings.

The final three fathers agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman, who is kept in the utmost secrecy, is the one Sam Wood ends up with at The Bachelor.
The three girls left are not gonna be able to tell who got the last rose.
However, in our conversation with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they may have inadvertently given us a hint as to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood 's lips are sealed before Thursday 's final .
All three women threw themselves into poetry as they described Wood as the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?" their answers may offer a clue as to who won the boy's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to point out that Mackay was Wood's best alternative after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been on a smooth ride since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, [Sarah's] energies and Sam's energies felt quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down-to-earth, and it's fun to be around her", Mark added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be having a nice, relaxed time together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said that last week's house calls made him realize that Wood might be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now involved with all my heart", he said.
When asked who else Wood should choose, Mackay was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say it", he said.
I like the other girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Channel Ten.

Jarryd Hay has a lot of options where he can start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in him after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open practice day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after the Australian rugby league turn-on dropped the ball in his first air-pump return in a 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight and took him to the track and field game after Reggie Bush got hurt.
Tomsula's true nature was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of blaming his newcomers for being a bait in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special editor Cam Inman reports that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Teams Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a flying saucer that the Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter.
This was certainly not the start Hayne and his numerous Australian fans had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Haynen was seen cursing on his way off the field after the fall, and later told Australian radio host Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on frequency 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared his hacking to his 2007 Origin debut, when a pass from his own end zone led to a Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for a photo with the fans on his Instagram account, holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, and so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized, and his efforts to support democracy curtailed.
4 killed when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's new constitution, officials said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Senior official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them were throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to cause so many deaths.
The clash was sparked by violent protests in recent weeks across Nepal's southern provinces, with members of the ethnic group called the Madhesi saying the new provinces created under the proposed new constitution will weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands a state of its own.
Since 10 August, violent clashes have killed at least 40 people, 11 of whom were police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement dividing the country into provinces - a big step toward a new constitution, but a very controversial one in Nepal, which has had a centuries-old central government.
A new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands.
Legislators voted on the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and authorities have said they could pass the new constitution by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says there's a 60 percent chance of a tornado south of Cape Verde.
The low-pressure front, located about 350 miles [560 km] south of the southernmost tip of the Cape Verde Islands, has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The other, near-line low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather center added.
Google is launching a fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has launched a fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who have arrived in Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal view when it posted it on its blog for the fundraising campaign.
Instead of being told by the director, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, along with hunger, thirst, cold and darkness", he wrote.
I was lucky.
But with the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe growing, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations are made to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the same amount for every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, bringing the total target to $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-ravaged Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight-loss surgery may help mildly obese diabetics
A new study suggests that mildly obese type 2 diabetics may enjoy the benefits of weight-loss surgery for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight-loss surgery than those treated by non-surgical methods.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data", says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight-loss surgeon who wrote the lead article for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In bariatric surgery, various methods are used to reduce the size of the abdominal cavity.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the subjects in the study were morbidly obese and had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, or the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of more than 25 indicates that a person is overweight, and a BMI of more than 30 indicates that a person is obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric bypass surgery, with medications for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the circumcised persons dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of subjects treated by non-surgical means remained broadly the same at 29.
Of the surgical subjects, 36 percent had complete and 28 percent partial improvement.
By comparison, the medically treated group had a total improvement of only 1 percent and a partial improvement of about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgery group", the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored the patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
The researchers write that hemoglobin A1c should be kept below 7 percent.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this improved "glycemic control", as exemplified by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study team also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
At year five, when compared with the gastric bypass surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had lowered their body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), had lowered their haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 and 2.1 percent), and were more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 and 16.7 percent).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while the study shows no survival or surgery after five years, there are studies in Sweden where surgery led to longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who had undergone weight-loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a 15-year period compared with those who had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study shows no improvement in survival for surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for those with a BMI of less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for the lower weight index group" and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at a point where the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
'I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously,' he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot take in all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain, a centre dedicated to ethical research.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the present situation the needs of all mankind should be put before the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
'Not everyone can come to Europe', he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised the German and Austrian actions in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
 It is wonderful to care for several thousand refugees, but in the meantime, we must think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The first thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, he added.
In his position on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the violent response of the United States caused a chain of violent events.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush, telling him that the solution to this problem is nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it had unforeseen consequences, the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the number of children ingesting hand sanitizers has quadrupled.
Drug registries across the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent increase in alcohol-containing hand sanitizers ingested by children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgia Drug Control Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, the number of cases of children under 12 years of age who ingested disinfectants increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are becoming more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are going to the daycare pool", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or respond to a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get cheap high-end juice.
Reports indicate that teenagers have mixed a disinfectant with alcoholic beverage to produce a stronger beverage.
The pleasant scents of the disinfectant may attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him", Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting ones (handkerchiefs) are those that have been scented.
There are strawberry, grapefruit, or orange-flavored disinfectants that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer can contain anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol", Mr. Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital's Poison Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey bottle on the table, but you leave hand sanitizer on the table, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who some time ago swallowed just four syringes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, twice the adult drinking limit, says emergency room doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated her at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was speechless and unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a segregated children's hospital for possible brain damage, as the alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary", Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or disinfectant towels and move disinfectants out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities estimate that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as the active substance.
In January in upstate New York, three fourth-graders planned to poison their "serious" teacher by spreading bacterial poison in the classroom, says a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her class.
The police must dismiss the plan as "a bunch of bullshit" and leave the disciplinary action to the school district.

Griffiths is dismissing the notion of contradiction .
Rumors of internal conflict have been circulating at Celtic, but Griffiths quickly overlooked them, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team prepares to face the Netherlands champions.
I don't think we're under any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to the game.
The Dutch are fed up with the lack of Scottish championship wrestling .
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with Rangers.
The current Ajax ambassador, De Boer, said: 'The highlights of Celtic's games are no longer shown in the Netherlands and why?
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People around here can't stand to talk about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of excitement at these games, and people outside Scotland want to watch them.
Deila vows to turn the tide .
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic are in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
A loss to Malmö and the resulting relegation from the Champions League was quickly followed by a ten-man defeat to Aberdeen, who are now five points clear of the next top seed.
But Deila said, "Celtic have had bad seasons before, and we're going to get back up".
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need fans, because it's going to improve the performance of the players.
It's important we stick together.
Warburton is wary of January 's transfer window .
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the potential January transfer deadlines, he is wary of the draft pick, assuring that he does not want to confuse the consensus of the team.
A former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
For players coming in this summer, there's a whole run-up to adjustment time, which is reflected in our squad this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic 's interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name has been linked with the Celtic transfer window, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swansea expires.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years and has been unable to find new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football Association over Neilson 's comments .
Hearts led 2-1 with Paterson being sent off, and the team then lost 3-2, the defender's red card was later revoked, and this was the third red card Collum had condemned in the last eight months to be revoked.
Neilson is true to his word, saying: 'I did not question the honesty, I did not comment on the performance.'
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle .
The loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a momentary distraction", the striker said, adding: "I think it's safe to say I won't return to Tynecastle unless I move to play for Celtic".
The Tannadic board believes in the leadership of Dundee United .
Simon Donnelly says the Dundee United board still has faith in the management's ability to turn the tide, but concedes that the decline in players must stop.
I think Stephen Thompson is trusting us.
We're gonna get these boys back on their feet, Donnelly says.
McInnes happy for Space to win the Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, were desperately stuck in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to achieve their seventh consecutive league win thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick, which lifted them to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: 'There is no team that has won anything, be it a cup or a league, that has not won games in this way.
Unemployment in Scotland will remain the same as the UK's overall population rises
UNemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, at 5.9%, is higher than the UK's 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: 'The government's long-term plan is to build the foundations for a stronger economy.'
It is almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the British Isles.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I'm witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
Unless there's any legal intervention, I'll watch the man be executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the lobby of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed with lethal injection.
He's asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and because there are often more applications than there are vacancies, participants are selected through a gruesome scoring system.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from 12 to 15.
Whoever gets elected is gonna be cool.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also established my own connection with him through the months of calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like him.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be a witness and a reporter, so I can't have a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember every detail.
A reporter from Oklahoma tweeted that I've been compromising on my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you'll be in.
I complained to the reporter.
Hään admitted that she could have put it better, but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he did.
I've told him he can take me off the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to cover it.
If Glossip dies, he believes the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
I'm here with Kim Bellware, a reporter for The Huffington Post.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast I made for the series.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of aiding and abetting anyway.
But I believe there's a very strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that executing him is wrong.
And so this is the angle from which I watch him die.
I can't claim to be completely neutral.
There'll be other reporters on the ground to take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I love die needlessly.
A man was lured out of the Canning River after a police pursuit.
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry while he lured a man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to mislead the police about his actions went awry when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres from the policeman, who tried to "gently lure him back to the beach".
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to divert them by directing them to the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me,'" senior sergeant Shandell Castledine told the Associated Press.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "honest police consultation".
"Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape", senior sergeant Castledine told me.
The world champion Ben Cousins is a striking example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing up and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to begin planning a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the editors tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing .
Peter Moody has claimed that the Racing Victoria executives tried to infiltrate his stalls last year, and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He blames the directors and the Racing Victoria's corruption department, claiming they have a personal campaign going on against him.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his aim has always been to do what's best for competition and that he's been in a difficult situation since Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue down about the espionage allegations for the last year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like jealousy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrating that it all comes out at once", Moody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high, and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, that's when I should stop coaching.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Moody had earlier foiled the bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he revealed that the anti-bribery unit had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, I'll name him if I ask, and offered him a job in my stall if he would pass on information about what I do there.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, then of course they should fire their lawyer, because they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, all knew about it at the time and they know about it today.
Should I start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps shift responsibility for what happens in the field to people other than the trainers?
Am I a threat to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they will have to take away my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I am now saying will possibly make them think just that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it's making me sad.
It really does make me sad.
I'm pressuring them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the long-term Lidar cobalt study, and the late rejection made him realize that he could 'throw his licence over the table'.
Moody, best known for training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the race day treatment rule "laughable" after mud or clay powder is put on the horse's legs, which is illegal.
It's against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its foot.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
He had it on race day.
Moody could face a three-month ban from competition for the funeral service on race day that the organisers have launched an investigation into.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The driver of the Cobram roadblock arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a hit-and-run accident after colliding with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he suffered serious injuries when he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He'll be charged with failing to stop in an accident, neglect of duty, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is attacking his opponents in a wrestling match.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised claims by two NRL champions that his team's kicks were part of a 'line-up'.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed Storm to fight on their own side when they unexpectedly won the final game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to cover up his reference to the Storm after they beat the North Queensland Cowboys in the final on Saturday night, calling the game the "symbol" of rugby league and saying that two Queensland teams were not "one of the enthusiastic" players.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles, saying they're just focused on "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by the two head coaches' criticism of the Storm, because it means they're afraid they're going to lose to the team.
"This is always the case, but I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the draw when we lost to them 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or our techniques all year, but for the last six weeks, we have only focused on the contact in the tackles, and that has made us successful.
Trent's been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a bit of a shock for him.
Funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 championship by playing "excitingly".
Wayne's been talking about how exciting rugby is.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell him how exciting their game was, Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010 when St George's was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought that side up in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, so they can play that way.
I get more confident when they say things like that, because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a contender for big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between the Storms and the Roosters was more racing than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
I'm sure the Broncos game was a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end?
We were 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does that make it exciting to break the line and miss a goal?
For me, this is about lines.
If they mention us, it means we can play them at some point.
The Storm have the weekend off, having already won the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at home in the pre-season next Saturday night at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
$ 200,000 bail for a Serbian man on a drug charge
A man facing life in prison for attempting to smuggle 40 kilos of cocaine into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked down 100 kilos of drugs on a Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and was docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with the other defendants at the marina all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
While Maksimovic is threatened with possible life imprisonment for attempting to possess cocaine for business purposes, his lawyers argued that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to possess the entire amount and that he may have been in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
He has strong ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently, he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 in bail to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both parties, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and abide by his curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while the girl was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service, where Hogg received numerous indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, found the phone was missing, and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and she immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers on the scene, and found "worrying" web searches for words used to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "scoop up pedophiles" on the Internet before he "pretended to be a cop to scare them".
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had done computer hacks but said that they were done only because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the photos, and about when Hogg asked the person to send him additional photos.
Hogg said he was only doing this for the purpose of the bait.
He said he's drunk and he's sick to his stomach, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When she found the pictures on her phone, she was screaming at her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw the indecent images on her phone and then met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she said that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than she was.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to one count of making or taking indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breached his bail on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hoggi be excluded from the sex offender register, as it could be argued that his crimes did not contain a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has postponed the sentencing until October to give social services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other cases that are ongoing, he's in pre-trial detention.
He was added to the sex offender registry before the day of sentencing.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe made a false speech to the parliament
The oldest African leader, Mugabe, fell down the stairs leading to the speaker's chair earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also marred by allegations by opposition lawmakers that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them not to bully Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they bullied and interrupted him with intermittent cries as he delivered a State of the Union address to parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the party's group leader, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
The number from which the message was sent is not answered, but the message is headed "death", Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that the immunity was ending and that when they left, the parliamentary immunity was no longer in force.
The group's watchdog said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in its business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its computer and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services business.
The expected job cuts will result in about $2.7 billion in expenses beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a press release.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than current HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help companies transition to new business", Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are better able than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprises will have annual sales of more than $50 billion and will "focus on providing unparalleled integrated technology solutions" to enterprises, the company said in a press release.
The split will dissolve a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical appliances, which operated out of a Palo Alto garage known as the "Birthplace of the Hidden Valley".
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in a line of business based on the belief that tightly-confined companies do better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the draw at Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming his recovery goes as planned, there is no reason why he will not be back playing by Christmas.
At best, Wilshire will miss at least four of England's next games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single knee injury, and he was recalling his old sharpness before the season started.
"This injury is not a career threat", Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's not weird.
It was just an accident.
It's not about his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger himself admitted, when a player tries to come back in the middle of the field, there is always the risk of further injury.
There's also an uncomfortable pattern in the making.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd. shows that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since making his debut six years ago.
In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons.
If you look at Arsenal as a whole after 2007-08, in six of the eight seasons, they have been one of the most injured teams in the Premier League.
Wenger concedes the witch's chance, but Arsenal believe their improvement from last season on the injury record will continue.
"Sometimes, when you're recovering from an injury, there can be a vulnerable period when you have to strengthen your body and get competitive", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he gets the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his squad as Arsenal start their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, followed by a game against Chelsea on Saturday and a game against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably in the starting lineup.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and give a breathing space to players who need it", Wenger said.
While Arsenal are the clear favourites to continue in the F-Block, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo have also not lost 41 games since they produced their own undefeated campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and is still motivated by a distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous", Wenger said.
Arsenal never made it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not wishful thinking.
FriendsFest: A comedy series that taught us some serious things about male friendship.
It is striking how similar descriptions are not found in the series, especially when one considers that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate among young men is higher than it has been for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of Men, challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school and college students who showed symptoms of depression found that a person's chances of recovery doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends were "healthy".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were half as likely to develop potential mental health problems if they had friends who were mentally healthy.
But for friendship to work, it has to be available.
In this age of social media communication, style is overridden by content, and the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, when in reality isolation is the norm.
This superficial success is driven by what psychologists call external values: money, image, social status, all at the expense of internal values -- inner yearning for personal growth and friendship -- that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The beauty of the Frendies was that they turned this focus on the upside.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personalities, which stood out in the interaction as friends.
The numerous hugs from Joey and Chandler, the moments in the comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As a Samaritan volunteer explained to me: ...listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how even the smallest interaction with a friend can make them feel better.
Often, the men who contact us feel they can't talk to their friends.
The old idea of getting over it is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about your problems, you'll be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term survival options.
It highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, out-of-the-way position on the other end of the phone helps people in their moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're attending Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the filming locations have been rescheduled for the occasion, why don't you take your friends out for coffee at Central Park.
Or, even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be airing on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, join #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to slap Malmo on the side
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan the goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG to beat Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes in their Champions League debut, paving the way for the French champions, but the team missed several chances before finally adding to their lead when Cavan scored in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as the game was not only about the place but also about the improvement in their quarter-final games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and was later traded from the field.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win is going to be a problem for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it's a good start, although there are things we have to work on this season", Blanc said.
This is good news.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisians after an injury in one of three changes made after the team finished 2-2 at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was shadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine attacker was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran to catch Marco Verratt's pass behind Malmö's line of defence and then hit a beautiful finish past the back corner of Johan Wiland's net.
But if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a tight opponent, beating Celtic in the deciding match to get to this level, its opener has nine international players and a five-man defence, and two players in deep midfield.
But the team offered little on the offensive side except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which went a button past Kevin Trapp's scoring stick.
However, PSG were sometimes in trouble due to missed passes and poor finishes, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five attempts in the first half alone and then was disappointed when Cavani put in the ball from Ibrahimovic's touch at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in his introduction to his teammates, and it was on Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent a spin kick that tilted around Wiland's scoring post in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored an hour later, thanks to Uruguay's Cavan, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had pointed forward from Maxwell's left cross.
Malmo's hopes of getting back into the game were dashed, and only Wiland's brilliant return by a direct kick from David Luiz kept the score down, before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the trade was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG were on a level higher than his team.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
It's not enough to fight.
I'll take my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore is raising $2.5 billion in stock sales.
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, which has suffered from a commodity price collapse, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its massive debt relief plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a press release that it had sold new shares for about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market share this year, is struggling with plummeting commodity prices as the slowdown in the Chinese economy weighs on demand and wreaks havoc on all markets.
The new index pushed the value of Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had disclosed last week a $2.5 billion stock deal as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold the new share capital at 125 pence a share, which was a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, representing a total of 9.99% of the merger.
Concerns about the long-term stagnation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement released Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner for Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
'President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time allowing President Obama and President X to have constructive discussions on issues of disagreement', the statement added.
During the visit, first announced in February, Xin is also expected to be in Seattle on his way to Washington, D.C. to meet with a number of U.S. technology leaders before heading to New York City and the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and the country's growing unconditional control over the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon is underestimating the difference in the filmmaking.
Matt Damon met with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
The veteran actor on HBO's Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight interrupted Brown as he stressed the need for different perspectives on the dark protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when casting for the movie, not the series", Damon claimed.
Shocked, Brown responded in disbelief to the offended, with comments like "Whoa! Wow. Okay", while the comments from the actor of The Martian hung in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series' finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about whoever the director is, how they treat the character of Harmony", Brown began.
The only dark character is a whore who's being beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the film's directing rights for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded rudely that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the chat was posted, social media exploded in outrage at Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film, writing: Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO BLACK it hurts.
The tweet has garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comments come at a time when the precise racial portrayal in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.
After the killing of teenage Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread across the country, calling on lawmakers and law enforcement to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince announced the nominations for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement in response to a question from Fox News TV personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a charity", the leaders said.
Recently, it was reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers, and media moguls who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
Professional basketball player and collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, with a grand prize of $1 million.
The competition programme, now in its seventh season, has never had a competitor who has survived all the stretches of the programme's track.
In the series finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 75 feet [23 m] in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and completed the challenge in time, becoming the first athlete ever to complete the grueling American Ninja Warrior 4th, but Caldiero completed the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero was interviewed by E!News after his hard-fought victory and was still in shock about winning the million-dollar grand prize.
"It's great to think about it, since I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year", Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like... the future is unknown.
Production manager Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten doesn't get more prize money, even though he's the first competitor ever to cross the finish line.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the one with the fastest time gets the money", Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and a life-changing experience, he gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he's holding a grudge about that.
He's just so happy that he got to do what he did.
His fans have been praising him.
He's a great guy and a great family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone was going to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac".
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are outscoring the Minnesota Twins .
The second half of the season hasn't been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best teams in baseball, but now they're last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played their role as the perfect spoiler Tuesday night when they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to get to the end of the half against the Houston Astros in the second wild card spot in the American League.
For Detroit, the game was at least one night of a return to the six-letter H word, which had been very hard to reach for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how you get them", said Tigers team captain Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support, with Detroit making three runs in the first two innings, then one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong finish to this year", Simon said.
It's hard for a switch-hitter to pitch every game, and that's why I want to go deep.
Tigers' reliever Victor Martinez hit three home runs and allowed two runs, his first hit since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since he hit four home runs against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He was a good swinger", Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked much better in batting practice, and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs down in the bottom of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back in the game.
Centre Byron Buxton opened the innings with two outs on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks retired with one base hit, and Simon was able to burn out right fielder Brian Dozier before Simon was traded to left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only opposing player, ahead of starting shortstop Miguel Sanoa, who pulled a two-base run to the left of right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With two runners on the field and a tiebreaker in second base, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouff to hit a home run to lead to a double.
It was a major league record, the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had a passing run in the ninth inning, Mauer pulled two hits against Tigers' closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander burned Sanno in three innings on his fifth save.
Detroit used a rusty Phil Hughes in the beginning.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a veteran right-hander who was left off the injured list before the game after being out for over a month with a lower back infection.
"Obviously, I didn't want to start like this", Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable and I felt like I was able to make some nice passes in the third inning".
After Hughes caught the starting pitcher on first base, he let second baseman Ian Kinsler advance by one.
The right-hander J.D. Martinez's walk in the two-point conversion put Victor Martinez on the batting line, who took himself to first base with a midfield hit and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 pipeline while the runners were in good running positions.
Triple-A Nick Castellanos continued to hit right and cause a second run, but the threat ended when Victor Martinez was passed out as he tried to advance to the triple.
The Tigers went on for the second inning and got one burn, two at-bats run by catcher James McCann and two burn, one at-bats run by center Anthony Gosell, after which it was 3-0.
"It was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit it very well, but it flew in the right direction.
Hughes started to count the pitches and pitched a scoreless third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed pitcher A.J. Achter.
Hughes was credited with three runs on six hits and a walk on four hits.
ATTENTIONS: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was suspended for throwing due to a sprained shoulder.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who removed Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August with a shoulder injury, but he was scheduled to return Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris' record with the Tigers is 1-1 in four starts since left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been out of the game since August 20th with a right abdominal hernia.
The Tigers and Twins' three-game series ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is set to face Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) in the second round of the playoffs.
Xi calls for greater opening of the economy to the world
The economy must be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with guiding reforms on Tuesday.
'China should commit to attracting foreign finance and expertise and develop an openness policy', he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Leadership Group on Deepening Universal Learning.
Supporting openness while pushing forward reforms will add new momentum and vitality and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting market access, a relaxation of border controls, a call for state-owned enterprises to raise private capital and a revision of the system of registration of residents.
The opinion proposes a negative list of sectors and firms which are not eligible for investment.
The system will be tested gradually and improved by experimental programmes.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legal environment for businesses and makes the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also loosens its control to the power it distributes to enterprises, thus ensuring that enterprises decide for themselves how to conduct their business.
The statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth development.
In order to open up the public sector to private investors, more sectors will be opened up.
'The government will not change its stance on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded enterprises and provide them with better services', the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent residence permits, green cards, for foreign nationals will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to practise as a lawyer and the support for professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, Senior Leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as stated in a statement issued after the meeting.
