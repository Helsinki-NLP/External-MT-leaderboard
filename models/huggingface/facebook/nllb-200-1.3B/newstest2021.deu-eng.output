Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
A motorist overlooks a biker
A 44-year-old woman wanted to turn left on the 1230 national road in the direction of Machtolsheim with her VW from Merklingen at about 21.30.
She overlooked a 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the collision
The biker tried to avoid the car, but he still ran into it in the rear of the vehicle.
The brake pads and foot brake levers were torn off the Suzuki and the driver was unable to brake.
He mentally steered his motorcycle into the green lane next to the roadway and let it roll without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
The motorcyclist nevertheless sustained a beam injury from the collision and had to be treated in a hospital.
Mamming: Mass coronavirus infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a mass coronavirus infection in a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are quarantined and no longer allowed to leave the farm.
There's a security detail overseeing the curfew.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 during the series examination, the Dingolfing-Landau County Council said on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, to prevent further spread, we have to take this step to protect the population", said Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had been infected in the factory before - this was the reason for the serial test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, growing strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beets - but the cucumbers are only for the glass.
Mamming is a rural community of over 3,300 people, not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
The farm has been separated from infected workers and the site is now fenced off.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government a share of the responsibility.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to check the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly retaliated when such local infections take hold and regional lockdowns have to be ordered", said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary executive director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this in a similar way: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers", said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"We believe that the hygiene conditions at work and in the home are the ones that need to be strictly controlled.
That obviously didn't happen".
The outbreak was "announced".
Aidenbachstraße metro station: Dangerous fight: 19-year-old falls into the railway bed after being pushed
During a fight between two groups of youths at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped onto the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, at the Aidenbachstraße metro station, a dispute broke out between two groups of young people at about 16:15.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
Initial investigations revealed that a 17-year-old Munich resident pushed a 19-year-old man to the ground.
The young man slipped over the side of the platform and fell onto the trackbed.
People from the 17-year-old's group helped the victim climb off the track.
There was no danger of a railway coming in.
Police say the two men had a fight.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his identity was later identified.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of data
The data storage is currently suspended.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, however, demands an extension of the storage period, according to a media report.
He wants to use it to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended data retention period - half a year instead of the planned ten weeks - following a media report.
Seehofer, who is also the Minister for Justice, asked for a quick change to the law in a letter to the Minister of Justice, Christine Lambrecht (SPD).
Seehofer therefore intends to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He felt it was wise to "make the urgently needed adjustments to the law now", the newspaper quoted the letter as saying.
The data storage is currently suspended.
A decision by the Court of Justice is awaited.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Justice Department told the newspaper that it would be reasonable to consider whether legal adjustments were needed until the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer had already spoken in June, together with the interior ministers of the countries, for a data retention reserve.
NBA: strip club annoyance for Clippers star Lou Williams
There's excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, a 33-year-old professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, is reported to have left the tournament grounds at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with permission to attend a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he did visit the Magic City strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who has admitted to visiting the hospital, according to ESPN, is back in isolation, undergoing daily COVID-19 testing.
His reason for visiting is chicken wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou", as he's known in the NBA, already expressed his love for those very wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame have the best wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has ordered Williams to be quarantined for 10 days.
That means the Clippers star will miss the first two official games after the playoffs.
The NBA wants to play at Disney World for the end of the coronavirus season.
The best 22 teams are currently preparing for the season finale, which starts on Friday night.
Söder comments on the coronavirus situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has alarmed authorities and politicians.
The large vegetable farm is currently staffed by nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries, over a third of whom have been infected with the coronavirus.
The yard is now quarantined and fenced off.
No one is to leave the premises, food is being delivered.
The authorities are now offering free coronavirus tests to the town's 3,300 residents.
As the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the county council has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bite": confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative", lawyer Quentin Chabert told the paper.
The lawyer added: "He is very sorry for what he did, and the confession was a release for him".
He said his mandate was "plagued by remorse and deeply concerned by the extent of the destruction".
If convicted, the man faces up to ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Nantes was badly damaged by a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out at three places in the church, far apart.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, now in custody, had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of forced entry into the church, he quickly caught the eye of investigators.
Discussion of the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss, set conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates finished facts", Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs most likely to become dangerous, Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules don't work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate cannot be avoided as to whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations which wish to break into this phalanx.'
He doubts, however, whether the German Football League is prepared to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
'It remains a legal risk to put investment fences around the Bundesliga's economic location in a single European market,' said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund has a turnover of 500 million euros and RB Leipzig has a turnover of 300 million euros.
The differences between the first three associations alone are immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million", explained the 58-year-old.
Looking back, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and have told the press instead of me", Grindel said of the purchase of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That's what I've been so busy with, humanly".
The gift, worth about 11,000 euros, was given to him by a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to take the consequences", Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous gift of the watch completely transparently and without suspicion.
Many people in the DFB knew about it".
He never "made a hole in the gift", assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naïveté, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": One person injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have again escalated with Donald Trump's deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes between protesters and police broke out in several cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was shot dead as a train of demonstrators was crossing a crosswalk.
Earlier, clashes had occurred in Portland during protests against racism and police brutality.
Security forces, including federal police, fired tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dispersed protesters.
Hundreds of armed protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid on her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who didn't live there, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, three people were wounded when a member of a group calling itself the Armed Black Alliance of America fired a gun.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of their lives.
The police set up barricades because counter-protesters from a white militia had also formed.
The two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
Police said they had taken a suspect into custody.
It has not provided any further details on the circumstances of the crime.
According to the New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler said that he, like many in the city, was "consoled and dismayed" by what had happened.
In the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters clashed with police on Saturday.
They set fire to construction cars outside a juvenile detention center, and the police used grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, fired fireworks and lasered police officers, Oakland police said late Saturday night.
The fire was quickly put out.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of protesters on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to hospital.
Also, windows were smashed in a courthouse and a fire was set, police said.
Investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: historical costumes defy the coronavirus
Although the big sauce was missing from the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But even if the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as the burning hall, Rakoczy ball or parade, many people came at the cost of the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy-flare", says the Kurdish director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, we go back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, when only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
A pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been attending the Rakoczy Festival in Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So this time in the year of the corona.
The couple have been cozying up at the Luitpold casino, watching the historical ones stroll and listening to live Cuban music at the Casino restaurant.
"I find it very pleasant", says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds who don't belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual highlights of the programme, first of all the fireworks on Friday evening and the historic parade and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"It's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year", she says.
Rakoczy horse race to be held again
For the actors of the historic Kurgast, the alternative programme meant more work in some cases.
Like Christina Gold, who, in a normal year, is in the parade and can be seen on the coach of the garden cafe.
This year, she was walking around town on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"This is more stressful, otherwise we have it easier", she says.
The riders' club had less to do, even though some riders were out in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will be held again next year", says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will be held again in 2021.
28 Corona cases in Spanish second-tier player Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second-tier football club CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper and deeper into crisis because of a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20 despite the first coronavirus case, one low hit after another.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, with one being hospitalized, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the town of the same name southwest of Madrid has so far had a chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now they're even threatening to be relegated to the second division.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last minute, the prosecution is investigating a possible offence against public health, the highest sports authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine at a hotel.
"They did not receive a fresh towel or gel until the sixth day of quarantine", reported the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos showed players hanging underwear and club clothes in their hotel rooms to dry after apparently having to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem was the food.
"It's neither good nor good enough", wrote "AS".
The club management, however, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The charge of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The rules set by the Spanish football federation have not been violated, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the flight, there were four infected people as of July 19, but all of them had been isolated and had not traveled.
All players and team members were tested again just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday.
When the team was in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members tested positive for the coronavirus.
The game was called off 60 minutes before the whistle, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch horses that get ripped off at the steam room.
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, shortly before 6 a.m., a road user reported two free-running horses on the coach between the entrance to Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the delivery truck and the village steam room.
After the officers had won the horses' confidence just before the steam room, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car put down.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: career-continuation imaginable
Time travel expert Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world time trial champion Tony Martin is quite ready to continue his cycling career.
"I am working with the team on the framework conditions for how and in what form it could proceed", the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the coronavirus break.
The negotiations with his team also concern the number of racing days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He recalled that earlier, when he got up after a fall, his first thought was, "Get back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little girl, I think, "What if?"
The cycling expert admitted that there were certainly aspects that were becoming increasingly difficult for him.
"But it was good to remember, in the context of the coronavirus, what I have in cycling and how much fun it is".
The time trial specialist is back in the race at the Tour de l'Ain (August 5 to 9).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavarian roads over the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the motorcycle ride ends in death.
An 18-year-old pedestrian is also killed.
Schönthal - Several people, mostly young people, died in accidents on Bavaria's roads over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit by a car on Saturday near Schönthal (Cham district).
Why the car went into the wrong lane was unclear at first.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old man on his car collided with a horse-drawn carriage on Saturday.
Police say he was on his way down the mountain near Beilngries.
He hit the carriage in a left turn.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the 12 occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, police said.
Another fatal accident in the Upper Palatinate town of Bad Kötzting killed an 18-year-old.
He had been lying on a street on Sunday night and was hit by a 42-year-old motorist.
Police believe the 18-year-old was trying to sleep.
The driver couldn't stop in time.
In Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district), a 57-year-old biker hit a car in a right-hand corner on Saturday despite braking fully.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, while the other three people in the car were uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was the subject of a debate on Saturday by Bavarian Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to Gabor Kovacs, the organizer of the August motorcycle protests against the ban, the minister pointed to major investments such as road safety on control panels and the de-escalation of dangerous corners.
"We have achieved a lot in recent years in terms of motorcycle safety", the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheeler fatalities has decreased by about 28 percent since 2011".
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Football coach Niko Kovac will soon be reunited with his new club AS Monaco at Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French champion will be a guest at the Hessen, the former club of the Croatian, on 1 August (16:00).
For the Bundesliga side, it is the first and only tough test before the Europa League replay against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting will be held without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends", Kovac explained.
The 48-year-old said that it was an interesting test in terms of sport.
Before his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB-Pokal.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to meeting Niko Kovac again", said Adi Hütter, the team's strength coach.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat in the deal.
In March, Frankfurt lost the semi-final match against Basel at their own stadium with a score of 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: county farm just past lockdown
In the county of Hof, the number of known new corona infections continued to increase over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
And then there's a case in the city court.
This brings the yard area closer to the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 killed by monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
The severe floods in Southeast Asia have affected more than 9 million people, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
The heavy monsoon rains killed a total of 700 people.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach isolated people by boat.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers lost their crops.
Tankhorns in National Park Die from Slides
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank horns died in landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year's floods are particularly severe, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New housing empty
In Cox's Bazar, in southern Bangladesh, the state has built housing for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, few have moved in.
It's difficult to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also in Grenezn.
People who used to have a house, even if it was small and resembled a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many homes are empty, but the government wants to see them taken over by those who lost their homes in the floods.

Argentina rejects counter offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Economy Ministry in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair", a statement said.
"With 50 percent of the children in Argentina living in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of South America's second largest economy is no longer sustainable under the present conditions.
Therefore, Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around USD 66 billion (around EUR 59 billion).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Lastly, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
The Argentine Government, however, is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last more than 50 percent.
Experts expect a decline in economic activity of about 10 percent this year.
At the end of May, Argentina had defaulted on interest payments amounting to US$503 million, leading to a limited default.
Professional arrival - not yet private
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller in the notarial office in Eggenfeld.
Six weeks later, in early July, the lawyer with a doctorate started work, and the normal day-to-day business was already going full steam ahead.
"I have to get there privately", she explains to the Rottaler Anzeiger, laughing.
The short lead time was not enough to move the centre of activity from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, says the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who is a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband could have applied for short-term parental leave to ensure the care of her two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
To avoid having to commute from Regensburg every day, she has a temporary possibility to stay overnight with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
She grew up in the neighbouring county, and the town of Eggenfelden has been a familiar name to her for a long time.
During visits to the area with her family in recent months, she had again noticed: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful little town".
She was all the more pleased to have entered the competition for the vacant post.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career also takes her home town of Lower Bavaria as a key player: after studying law in Passau, she completed her term as a law lecturer and her second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also completed her doctorate in labour law - she started her first job as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the Passau district in 2012.
In 2016, she went on maternity leave, and then moved to Regensburg.
Since then she has held representative positions in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because of Lutz Feller's impending retirement, she saw the right time for a full career come again, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has a compliment for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded procedures here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In the case of kindergartens and daycare centres, it has already contacted a local institution.
And if all goes as she hopes, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be even 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan comeback.
"Due to the distance rule, which is mandatory, we plan according to the current situation with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators", Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
The arena in the district town usually holds a little over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the coronavirus pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality sector can be reopened in addition to the normal seats: 'It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely wiped out'.
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is "well advised to start with a stable page length".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-term jobs in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited", Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing director praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work".
Little miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl of butter, barely three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The baby is one of about 400 premature babies who are cared for at the Graz Children's Hospital each year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, and a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight, weighing less than a kilogram at birth.
They're born so small and so early, that neither the lungs nor the intestines nor the muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and miniature diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they would not be in voice - "and how", smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Although they don't scream as loudly as big babies".
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the beginning of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen City Theatre presented the production "The Home Dress" to the pupils - and this was done via video.
Afterwards, the pupils were able to chat via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format was born out of the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the classroom.
Although all involved agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage would provide additional stimulation, theatre also offers the potential for contact with schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation", said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: TSV 1860 would play against Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
If TSV 1860 qualifies for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the Sunday draw.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal are fixed.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualifying.
This was revealed by the draw on Sunday evening on the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the Corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
The voluntary abandonment of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen has already put TSV 1860 in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions will meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second-tier club Würzburg reaches the final, Sixty would already be in the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will be played between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the Third League.
"Blown by the Wind": movie legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The movie legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, her spokeswoman confirmed to the German press agency.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic Gone With the Wind (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatre director Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Warner Brothers immediately signed her to a seven-year contract and released her alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight movies with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar for her role in To Each His Own.
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mother's Heart".
Three years later, she won best actress for her performance in William Wyler's The Heiress.
She also received acclaim as a neurotic eccentric in The Dark Mirror and The Snake Pit.
Daphne du Maurier recommended her for the lead role in the 1952 film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she performed in "Crying for a Dead Body".
She had a son Benjamin from her marriage to writer Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953).
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had a daughter, Gisèle, with him.
That marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler misses finals at comeback
World champions Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler have missed the finals of the "Road to Timmendorf" beach volleyball tournament.
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semifinals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their victors Ehlers/Fluges beat the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with a 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played out at the beginning of September at Timmendorfer Strand: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz's expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" from the FDP's point of view and does not change the party's character.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD", said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the Berlin-based dpa news agency.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of deliberation the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by majority in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago", Strasser said.
"There is no political will in the AfD to do so, however, because right-wing extremism has now become part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not mean anything and does not change anything", he told "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the centre of the AfD".
Blume expects the AfD to fall below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in parliament are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen for the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the protection of the Constitution classifies the strangulation as "certainly a right-wing extremist endeavour".
In May, the AfD board had kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
He stated that Kalbitz had not mentioned his former membership of the now banned extreme right-wing party "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz is denying membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Group in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the Federal Arbitration Court's decision does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD will remain a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz".
This decision will not weaken the Federal Party or the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is clear.
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the future of the EU's external borders.
"The AfD is not going to get rid of the ghosts they called.
A firing won't change anything", said Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn of the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD National Association and the faction held to this day as their right-wing leader".
The legal debate over Kalbitz's membership of the AfD will continue.
The court announced on Saturday that it would now take civil action against the Federal Arbitration Court's decision.
North Sea wind farms supply 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent increase over the same period last year, said Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and for its transmission through the German electricity grid.
The Baltic Sea wind farms, which are not part of the Tennet network, generated an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
The total wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea thus amounts to 13,73 TWh, compared to well over 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Wind harvesting at sea accounts for almost 19 percent of all wind power in Germany, about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms increase production capacity
The increase in the contribution of offshore wind energy is due to higher generation capacity, in addition to wind, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the last 12 months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full capacity at the same time, they could calculate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this purpose, according to Tennet, at 7,1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing €20 billion in the expansion of offshore network connections by then", said Tim Meyerjürgens, Tennet's managing director.
In reality, even offshore wind farms cannot reach their full capacity, but can reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year was January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatt hours of electricity.
On average, North Sea wind farms produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity to almost seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a little 130th anniversary party.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
The dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper, was followed by many more art lovers than usual.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the Sandtogether Association was involved.
Freital: Windberg festival canceled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival is not happening this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended the city festival.
"We have not made this decision easily and, knowing how difficult it is economically for the parties involved, we have hoped until the last minute", said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (Partilos).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as organizers".
Because if tens of thousands of people were to flock to the mainland and the tent, they would not be able to comply with minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current coronavirus protection regulations.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg consoled me for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressure Olympic champion Werth in Achilles
Achleten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the top rider in the Austrian Achleten dressage tournament.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four races in four starts over the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Wreathgold and Quantaz, she was unbeaten in the Grand Prix Special and the Kür on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday in the Special.
The German was also clear ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer in the Kür on Saturday.
Werth's winning horse, Quantaz, is owned by Max Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is set to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cure ever.
At the first tournament in Achleten three weeks ago, Werth had already won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14 to 16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University of Applied Sciences is still in the air: the "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" founds a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship provides the possibility of starting studies not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This will enable us to train twice as many students as we have so far.
At the same time, capacity is being used evenly at both the DFS College and the Air Traffic Management Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of professors.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been studying Air Traffic Management at the University of Worms as part of their flight control training.
This year, nine students have already started.
The experience of the DFS so far has been very positive, and the performance of the students has been excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training is a major contributor to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, we are not comfortable with economic development.
We are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel", says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Executive Board of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the Foundation Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, multidisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university while at the same time strengthening our attractiveness as an employer".
This is also emphasised by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and business.
With this we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's programme Air Traffic Management".
The confidence of the German Air Traffic Control Authority is both a motivation and an obligation for the University of Worms to further develop its teaching and research capabilities in the future fields of aviation.
In its work on the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first foundation professorship for a dual degree programme.
Dr Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, emphasises: 'With its focus on air transport, the University of Worms is unique in Rhineland-Palatinate.
The signing of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the profile of the university".
Helicopter landing on the A45
The A45 motorway was completely closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopters were in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford around 12:40 in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the corner straight ahead and landed on the dashboard.
The crash triggered frontal airbags, causing the driver to suffer minor facial injuries and to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were treated by the emergency room doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about EUR 2,000, had to be towed.
Heil wants to check other sectors after meat industry
The Corona crisis has brought the situation in parts of the meat industry back to the surface.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will they remain so?
The Federal Minister for Labour, Hubertus Heil (SPD), wants to check other sectors under the now planned strict rules against irregularities in the meat industry.
"We will look at each sector and then take appropriate measures for each sector if necessary", Heil told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
German employers are already warning against restricting employment contracts in general.
After the massive coronavirus outbreak at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law this Wednesday to save lives.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer employ outside staff for slaughter, cutting and processing of meat.
The aim is to prohibit the use of contract workers and temporary workers.
The Commission has also been asked to consider the possibility of a new approach to the problem of the unemployment rate.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My aim is not to ban employment contracts everywhere in the German economy".
The Commission is also concerned about the need to improve the quality of the services.
"When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on employment contracts and temporary employment in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not clear why the portioning and packaging of cheese should be subject to different labour laws from those governing sausages, according to a statement on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
If the ban were to be lifted, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo of product.
Many Eastern European employees from contracting firms worked in the industry, according to the results of an audit by the NRW-Workers' Safety and Health Administration, some 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively harsh law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up the mess".
The politician announced: 'The Labour Protection Act, which we intend to pass in the Cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only affect the meat sector - for example higher rates of inspection in the field of labour protection or clear criteria for communal housing'.
The draft law in question includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and to the Law on Safety and Health at Work.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following:
"I wish we could do more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport", Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more controls also require more staff.
Three dead in ultralight plane crash in Germany
Three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel, in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district administration said.
Police say a parachute was found at the scene.
The Rheinische Post reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or double-family home.
Further details were not disclosed at the outset.
The evacuation of Frankfurt Opera Square is peaceful
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the opera house on Sunday night has also been peaceful.
Lastly, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left before the curfew began at 1 a.m.
The police were on the scene since early evening with numerous officers, and a large police presence was seen throughout the city.
For the first time, the Opera House was closed from midnight on that weekend, after a week of rioting.
Police officers were attacked with bottles from the crowd.
At least five officers were injured, police said, damaging several police vehicles.
The night of Saturday had also been quiet.
Car overturns: young woman seriously injured in accident on Federal Highway 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries on Sunday at about 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
Firefighters used thermal imaging cameras to search for possible passengers.
Police said the woman was on Federal Highway 83 heading to her home in Hümme when her car, for reasons still unknown, derailed and crashed several times.
To save the victims, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, a thermal imaging camera was used to search the adjacent cornfield from the rotor.
The Warburg drone team, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered to search for the person.
But the search crews did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured were taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further treatment.
Nearly 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on the scene.
The federal highway was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record-breaking Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th scudetto in club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit the 1-0 mark before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which entered without the recently injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to move from first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Second-placed Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo hit after a free-kick with the last action.
Miralem Pjanic's extra shot was used by the 35-year-old from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the blurry but decisive success.
The foul-mouthed goalkeeper in the 89th minute is the only one Ronaldo could have been wrong about, given the score of the goalkeeper.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at the top of the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily", coach Maurizio Sarri said after the 1:2 win at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
The Juve coach said that the mental exhaustion of his players was especially great.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not been able to perfect the championship.
Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table was ultimately due to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the 11 games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had only won five.
Whether Ronaldo will be the king of goalkeepers is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals at Hellas Verona after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football will have her next title shot.
Juventus are in the Champions League play-offs, but will have to settle for a 0-1 home defeat against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the fines and court decisions threatened, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparable figures for previous years, the races are increasingly working for the judicial authorities: the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigative proceedings for illegal racing in 2018, a year later they were already 252 and in the current year by the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less organized events, as can be seen from the Ministry of the Interior's reply to a request from the SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously run into each other or fled from the police - also being reported as illegal racing.
The majority of the drivers were German men aged between 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonments have been issued.
But there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists were more sensitive than before and reported more frequently because of the many tragic accidents and lawsuits of recent years, a ministry spokesman said.
Highway 8 is particularly popular with racers, and drivers repeatedly brake traffic to make room for a race.
In August last year, a dozen drivers were caught off-ramp near Kirchheim, while three months earlier there were 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
The A81 is even the place where the police register more races than any other federal motorway.
The speed limit is used to try to slow down the races on the particularly affected section between the narrow and the freezing.
The most expensive and luxurious sports cars often have Swiss badges, because drivers avoid the grass in Germany because of the high fines for speeding and racing in the neighbouring country.
The SPD's speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "A general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour would eliminate this problem on motorways", says Martin Rivoir, the SPD's transport expert.
"The threshold for racing would be significantly higher if you weren't legally allowed to be here and there at 200 kilometres an hour or more".
He is less interested in education or image campaigns: "Those who ignore all rules in this way and risk not only their own lives but also the lives of other road users are hardly reachable by reason".
ADAC calls for more police intervention
However, this is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that speed limits cannot deter racing", says Holger Bach, head of transport and environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even more stringent checks on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-level competition becomes more painful and serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died at the races nationwide, including two uninvolved in a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, in November, two young men were said to have taken part in a car race.
One of the vehicles went off the road, hit a garden wall, and was left on the side, killing the 18-year-old passenger.
21 other people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, there is no need for tougher penalties: "There is no need for legislative action to punish illegal motor racing more harshly", says the Interior Ministry paper.
July 23rd: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A Witness heard noises on the Valley Road at about 3:40 a.m. and ran toward the snack bar.
There he noticed a man serving drinks at the refrigerator and then leaving the snack through a previously locked front door.
The perp fled towards the meadows behind the snack.
The burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range, according to police.
The suspect is described as being about 5'9" to 5'9" tall and of good stature.
He was wearing a black hoodie, black pants and bright shoes.
The police are taking further witness testimony.
Ackermann sprints to victory on the final stage at the Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann has won his second day's victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfalzer from Team Bora-hansgrohe won the 109-kilometer-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint, after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was Ackermann's third and fourth wins of the season.
In the overall classification, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had decided to ride the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the top spot in the standings.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage of the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win", Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic", said the 26-year-old.
300 meters from the finish, he just put on his sprint, and it worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, all participants and their companions were tested for the coronavirus six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and attendants were isolated in hygienic bubbles from the organizing team and the media.
Spectators were not allowed at the start and finish.
The headquarters has issued instructions for the reanimation of the layman.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
In one multi-family home, a child (4) was swimming when he was suddenly found dead in the water.
According to the fire department, the emergency call came in just before 1:00.
"A dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation", a fire department spokesman told BILD.
Soon after, rescue workers began resuscitating the victims.
The child, who was in danger of death, was transported to the University Hospital under intensive care.
It's unclear why it crashed.
The police have routinely taken up the investigation into the accident.
Fire department spokesman: "We believe there was a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1,000 people participated in a Saturday night "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of the central Franconia, around 22.30 hours the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased traffic in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then conducted a series of vehicle checks.
Only recently had the police announced that they were going to step up their crackdown on so-called "autoposers".
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted at the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balance.
However, only a small proportion of these are attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene was acted upon by the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on the spot, it is considered that this was mainly a spectacle.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the rules on infection prevention, in particular with respect to minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site inspection was completed at about 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found 10 vehicles with such structural changes that the operating licence had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There was no illegal car racing.
"The police precinct of the central Franconia will continue to monitor the situation and continue to carry out increased control measures, including in relation to the arrival of spectators", it said.
News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have nice rims, we can't scratch them", says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause damage.
"I want the young people to get their cars back in one piece".
Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of short-term abuse
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating some 900 suspected cases of short-term wage abuse.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-term work", said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive director responsible for the operational business, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the start of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-term work, BA had to react quickly.
The examination normally takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We shall therefore look more closely at the final accounts.
I'm sure there's plenty more to come.
We are not naive and we have a long breath".
Evidence of abuse often came from the employees or unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analytical software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible insolvency bubble in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than last year?
The estimates are different, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our staff in the employment agencies to deal with applications for insolvency benefits".
The figures are still unremarkable, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage site in Potsdam: party in the new garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, some 40 youths were celebrating a party in the Neues Garten.
The gathering was dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the staff of the Foundation for Prussian Castles and Gardens (SPSG), the foundation said at PNN's request.
The teenagers left the park.
On Saturday night, some youths would have been playing rugby in the New Garden.
The grass had been cleared by police officers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said Sunday.
There are always illegal parties in the parks.
In the parks of the foundation, there are always gatherings where the rules of distance and hygiene are not observed.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later, about 150 people celebrated in the Neue Garten.
Even without the coronavirus, the parks will be closed at dusk.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited by park regulations, with few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors leave more and more trash and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have taken on a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass testing after coronavirus outbreak in tourist area
Authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular tourist resort of St. Wolfgang, Upper Austria, with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, the state authorities in Linz reported.
More than 100 results were still outstanding at night.
Many of the infected are young trainees in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew has been set at 11:00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said Hans Wieser, head of the Wolfgangsee Tourist Association, the dpa.
Some guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
By Friday, the first infections had become public.
The head of the district administration, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns who had been celebrating in several places and could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do that when we were young", he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young staff about the dangers of Covid-19.
Starting Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July onwards were contacted.
The outbreak brings to mind the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of coronavirus spread across Europe during the early phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the Premier League on the final day of the season with a 2-0 (0:0) win over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes have to settle for the Europa League because Chelsea have passed and qualified for the King's Cup as fourth.
In the battle against relegation, Aston Villa were allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the play-offs, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League, won the match against FC Bayern in the round of 16, thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"It means a lot to me", said coach Frank Lampard, who is in his first season as Chelsea manager and also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who finished sixth in the Europa League with a meagre 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace.
Aston Villa decided the distance with Watford and Bournemouth for themselves, but had to shudder for a long time at West Ham United for the class maintenance.
The late leader Jack Grealish (84) was immediately matched by Andrej Jarmolenko (85).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, as Watford lost to Arsenal with 2:3 (1:3).
The club, which fired three managers in the season, is relegated after five years in the top flight.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save themselves with a 3-1 (2:1) win at Everton.
At the end, there was one point missing.
Liverpool, who have been the reigning champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win over Newcastle United.
99 is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
The record is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle took the lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38), Divock Origi (59) and Sadio Mané (89) played the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an exceptional season for this wonderful club", said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "which should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard".
The Premier League bosses should be happy, too.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even discussion of early cancellation or the remaining games being played on neutral ground.
The season was finally completed without any major incidents - but as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are getting more and more violent.
There were violent clashes during the night.
Israeli police violently attacked protesters in Jerusalem on Sunday night protesting against right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, some 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called for Netanyahu's resignation.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
Protests also took place in many other places in Israel, including outside the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying protesters with pepper spray from a moving car, police said.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several recent demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations are accompanied by the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
The report also calls for a new round of action to be taken on the basis of the new rules.
The Corona crisis has taken a heavy toll on the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was last over 20 percent.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has recently risen to new records.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes into car - nine injured - Ruhr area - picture.de
Ahlen - A road accident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen claimed nine lightly injured people.
A woman was driving her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
Police: "She must have brake suddenly because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes van that was driving behind her must have seen it too late.
He crashed into the car in the back.
Three occupants of the car and six of the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals border town after suspected coronavirus case
North Korea has seen "clear success" in its own measures to fight the coronavirus.
Now the country reports for the first time a suspected case.
Due to the first official suspected coronavirus case in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a major city for fear of a disaster.
Despite strict epidemiological measures over the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country", state media reported.
The region around the border town of Kaesong has been declared a state of emergency.
The Communist leadership has declared the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, the suspected case would be the first official case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea had so far reported no infections, and described its defense measures as "a clear success".
The figures were questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in a "defector" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
The border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide, largely undeveloped military buffer zone was not initially confirmed by South Korea.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, the South Korean military has acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high.
A number of people were investigated.
North Korea said on Saturday that it had called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party's Politburo, chaired by Kim Jong Un, over the suspected incident.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and devastating disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a precautionary measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others", it said.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had contact with her were quarantined.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is to investigate the "exodus" and the conduct of the military unit responsible and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of City Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still being discussed before the big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Downtown East", reads the central part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCenter Pforzheim.
The upgrading of the Eastern City in particular is, however, controversial to the end.
The majority is narrow, and in some committees, depending on the number of members, it is even negative.
An appeal from the business community (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed by the citizens and then by the administration and the municipal council, now fail after almost ten years of preparation, was criticized by project opponents as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspected", "speculation", "deception" and "conscious falsehoods".
"Everyone thinks they know better", said Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list in the city council for a year.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit comes the city cheaper, the Technical Town Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced, for 8.5 million euros to renovate.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted by the City Hall and the economic proponents.
The city was to be built by its own force and not by an investor: that was his plan B. A day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Castle Hill, the renting of the ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale urban redevelopment, ideally with local actors.
Environmental issues at the heart of the debate
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The city council will vote on the noise reduction plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from the health effects of road traffic noise, including many measures to reduce the speed of traffic.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of the 30th speed, but the city's political leaders are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinner times and by not being very committed to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession of the state of Baden-Württemberg to the climate pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal Smart City programme.
Citizens are welcome, but they must be mindful of the coronavirus protection measures.
With a long delay Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the Supercar League could begin regular operations, the first test runs were now in the pipeline.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygienic conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old long-haul driver made his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the previous season's Porsche", says Zimmermann.
"For example, with the ABS, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman is already experienced in GT sport despite being only 25 years old and has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a novice in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges", says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have made tremendous progress on the Lausitzring from session to session".
It is here, at the Lausitzring, that the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From July 31st, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
But Zimmerman, who's one of 15 serial novices, knows the track.
He was last seen at the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track", says Zimmermann, who races for the Graf Zeppelin race team in Friedrichshafen.
"The Lausitz ring has many fast passages, which you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmerman really is, we'll find out in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, play a little poker in the tests", he says.
"In the end, we are very satisfied and looking forward to our first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
There are seven races to go until the beginning of November.
As of now, no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine order
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister off guard, according to press reports.
The Commission has not yet decided on the measures to be taken.
Due to the rising coronavirus numbers in Spain, the London cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new rule goes into effect today, Sunday, which means Shapps will also be quarantined once he returns.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are on the final day of leave, starting on Saturday 1 August, and it was not introduced overnight.
Spain is still considered one of the 'safe countries' in Austria, which does not need quarantine in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine for holidaymakers in Spain will be imposed", Labour MP Diane Abbot commented.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Less than a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew, infection rates in the country are rising again.
Virologists blame the new outbreak mainly on nightlife.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations for the British.
The UK government currently advises against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 cases of the new coronavirus have been recorded in Spain, and more than 28,000 deaths.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the occasion of the Navy Day that his country will equip warships with the most advanced hypersonic weapons.
These unique weapons would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian Navy, Putin said Sunday at the Central Naval Parade in St. Petersburg.
The Ministry of Defence also reported to Interfax that it had successfully tested the Zircon hypersonic missile, built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 1,100 feet per second.
They're considered the weapons of the future.
The development of underwater trophies continues
The nuclear-powered underwater torpedo Poseidon was also being built, it was said.
The planned sea drone is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed on a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be commissioned by the various naval organizations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has a coastal area as large as any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Russian Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said on the day that sailors across the country celebrate.
In many other Russian coastal locations, the Navy also marked the day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside the ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There was also a lot of ammunition fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help made difficult because of Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this season to make landfall over the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, high winds and heavy rainfall are now threatening parts of the state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. National Weather Service (NOAA) said Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency in several counties.
The coronavirus pandemic in Texas has made it difficult for the aid workers to get to work, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuees warned to be cautious
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge", Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
He added that "this challenge is complicated and compounded when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state".
According to Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus pandemic has killed about 5,000 people in Texas alone.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed", such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It's important that everyone stay away.
Therefore, hotel rooms have been provided in some places.
And they're supposed to be tested for Corona in emergency shelters.
Damage had initially been reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With winds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, the "Hannah" was reportedly stranded on Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest category one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was initially issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown as the ship continued inland and headed northeast toward Mexico.
Douglas is heading to Hawaii.
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was heading toward Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of about 90 miles per hour.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected it to continue to weaken.
It is forecast to be near the major Hawaiian islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA predicted an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into major storms.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, and that of a sub-average one was even 10 percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump tweeted that his government is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with affected states.
Four goals scored: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo 's Filip Djuricic has been dismissed for two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals conceded: Sassuolo Calcio had a terrible night at the SSC Naples in the Italian Serie A (0:1) - and was really angry at the referee's video assistant.
"A festival of untouched goals for Sassuolo.
Never has the VAR been so harsh on a team", commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Napoli had gone ahead in the 8th minute through a goal from outside defender Elseid Hisaj, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the equaliser.
The video assistant referee (VAR) pulled the trigger because of a sideline position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goal of Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) was also taken by the referee team at the VAR's direction.
In the postseason, Allan perfected the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records", reports the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard is injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "quite well" after a short vacation and a few days of training, must think after the first team training how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield manager Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and is in danger of missing crucial first-class matches.
In Munich's Schmuddelwetter, the right-hander broke off a training match and was driven off the field with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular will have to pause in the title fight is open to debate.
A move in the play-off semi-final against Chelsea on 8 August is unlikely to be possible for the 24-year-old in the final tournament, which starts in Lisbon on 12 August.
The Bavarians are not going to let the bad luck of Sunday's training stop them.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formal the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
The quality, intensity and concentration of his victory-hungry title collectors should be demonstrated in the ideally following 28 days leading up to the King's Cup final on 23 August.
"We have done our championship and cup duties just fine.
The next step is to create something special", said Flick.
But before the Munich fans can get to grips with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve, they will have to play the eighth-place match against Chelsea.
After the 3:0 in the second leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become the Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "final dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build confidence with a good game", Flick said.
A test of temperament is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had promised his stars, who had taken a 13-day vacation after the double, a one-time August.
He welcomed 31 players at the Säbener Strasse, including the new players around Edel-Einkäu-ring Leroy Sané, who met all his new colleagues on the pitch for the first time since his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy has adjusted well, like all newcomers", Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. will no longer be allowed to just train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, the Londoners are now training in team strength, which is in the rhythm of the game, unlike the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, with Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin as possible opponents in the semi-final.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy", stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
World Cup record-setting Klose and Flick know of so much joint tournament preparation, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 setting.
Flick praised working with his current team as "a pleasure".
The "focus on winning" was an impressive feature of his team.
The nine-team tournament on Sunday was also ambitious.
All the players were present, including the emigrating Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the season is not guaranteed.
Formula One needs a special rule to cure its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All the American races have been cancelled.
The race calendar is getting more and more concrete
The racing calendar for the current Formula One season continues to take shape.
The ten confirmed Grands Prix have been joined by three more racetracks during the week.
In October, the race will be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and at Portimão in Portugal.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points at the Italian traditional racetrack in Imola.
The 2020 calendar thus comprises 13 races as of today.
"We are delighted to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season", said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motor sport will be held during this exceptional season.
Formula One is looking to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Media reports suggest that there could be races in Vietnam and Malaysia in late November before the officially announced races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Rules require races on three continents
The rules of Formula One require that the World Championship be held on at least three continents.
Even though, as currently planned, only two continents will be raced, there is to be a world champion.
The FIA has decided to grant the title in "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
Furthermore, Formula One will not be hosted in America this year.
Rejection is criticized in Brazil
Due to the tense coronavirus situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being with them again next season", Carey explained.
The cancellation of the America's Cup was criticized, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation came as no surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it", said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the São Paulo Grand Prix.
In the São Paulo region, infection rates are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to want to race in Brazil would not justify a cancellation.
The Commission is prepared to take the necessary security measures.
Greta Thunberg: The world was looking at Donald Trump
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's popular Late Night Show and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show.
She told of her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil look" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
NEW YORK CITY - For the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been making headlines for her tireless work for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she's on a popular late-night talk show talking about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Late-night host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on your show Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that have surprised me", she said.
"How far people will go to divert attention from the climate crisis", she shocked.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of kids take to the streets", she said.
She finds it "funny" to see heads of state and leading politicians mocking her on social media or even trying to silence her, showing her the reactions "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a familiar scene in which she gave US President Trump a bitterly angry look.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, where she sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive look was captured by cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip turned into a GIF, an animated image, which eventually became one of the most widely used images for Trump opponents.
But what was the 17-year-old thinking about the President of the United States at that moment?
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid to the Member States.
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the blunt answer and disappeared from view with a laugh.
She was remembered by many at the climate conference for her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with a three-pack for Lazio Roma
Ciro Immobile is now on a par with Bavarian Robert Lewandowski in the race for the European Golden Shoe.
Former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in Lazio's 5:1 (1:1) win over Hellas Verona, including two converted half-centuries in the second half.
The 30-year-old from the fourth place in the table has now 34 goals on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski scored from FC Bayern Munich in the previous Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening at Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent in Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly back up.
Now blues-rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
The legendary guitarist, drug addict, cult fan, co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, adding that a further statement would be announced in the coming days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all past and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had formed the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is still remembered today.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
It is said that there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to appear in long robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental health problems are also thought to have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970, three years after its formation.
There followed a social decline.
The blues-rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatric hospitals.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener, and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a working-class Jewish family in the London borough of Bethnal Green.
From a young age, he was fascinated by American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar strokes.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to perform as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly after, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green formed Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with fellow Bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The Green-composed song "Albatross" gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But his rapid rise soon showed its dark side: Green did not encourage the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life was drugs - the best thing was landing a number one hit".
Toward the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a cult success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac was floating on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various minor solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he got his start in 1996 with a group of musicians he befriended.
The British Daily Telegraph reported that a rock star had returned to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group before the band disbanded in 2004.
Music experts consider him a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of recent decades.
