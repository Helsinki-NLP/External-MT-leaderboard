Thousand farmers arrive at High Court against the bullet train project of Gujarat's development dream
A petition has been filed in the High Court against the acquisition of land from farmers of Gujarat for the Union Government's Dream Project Bullet Train.
During the hearing of the petition, 1000 farmers took oath and stated that the State Government has no right to acquire their land.
The Chief Justice's bench had issued an ultimatum to the Central Government that if the Central Government does not reply on the land acquisition on 26th, the court will issue a final order.
The High Court has also frowned on the Central Government for flouting the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court.
A further hearing on the matter will be held on September 26.
The High Court had taken the state government by surprise after it had seen objections to the oath of office of 1000 farmers from 8 districts of Gujarat in the Interstate Bullet Train Project.
You are misleading the court.
In your presentation, you said that only 4 or 7 farmers had objected, but here a large number of farmers have taken oath.
Advocate Anand Yajniak, on behalf of farmers, argued that the Union Government has not submitted a response for the most expensive project in the country worth Rs.1 lakh 10 thousand crore, involving more than one state, despite the delay of more than 3 months.
The Centre is trying to prevent the case from going forward in the High Court without reply.
As there is no strong defense against land acquisition by the Central or State Government, the collector is threatening the farmers as a last resort.
Blackmail is being used to seize land as it is newly conditioned land.
The threat is that the land will be confiscated if it is not acquired.
Despite the Supreme Court's order of August 10, the Centre has not submitted a response to the High Court.
As a result, the farmers will go to the Supreme Court again tomorrow to demand that their order be complied with.
Over 3,000 farmers from 8 districts of Gujarat will travel to Japan to save their land and report all facts to Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) about the injustice done to them by the Central Government.
The agreement with the Gika also provides for cancellation of the agreement if there is injustice to the farmers.
The farmers will inform Gika that the contract for the bullet train has been signed with the Japanese company Gika and a loan of Rs.
But Japan has not yet paid more than Rs 300 crore in installments.

Internationally, China is trying to make the yuan the same level as the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
In view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibilities of making this deal in rupees and rubles.
India and Russia today agreed on S-400 missile defense system amidst the whims of US sanctions.
The MoU will be signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The US dollar is in the process of being used to facilitate the S-400 deal.
Sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibilities of making this deal in rupees and rubles in view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US.
The US imposed sanctions on China during the deal
In September, Russia had signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
This ban made it almost impossible for China to buy missiles using US dollars.
However, over the past few years, China has been trying to establish its own currency, the yuan, as an international currency relative to the dollar.
Following this initiative, China has been making continuous efforts at the international level to make the yuan the equivalent of the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of US dollars in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency
The US may impose a CAATSA ban on the $5 billion defense deal.
Last month, the US imposed a ban on China's purchase of the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia had started to establish alternative arrangements for the deal from that time.
Earlier, the US ban on the INS Chakra lease repair deal from Russia had triggered a 2 billion dollar deal between India and Russia.
To get out of this situation, the economic analyst claims, India should exercise the deal using the rupee-ruble exchange as the international currency.
It is worth mentioning that all the defence deals that India has done with Russia so far have been done through the medium of dollars.
Why the U.S. Cats Act?
President Donald Trump approved the Katsa law in August, in view of Russia's advanced missile defense system. - The US has drafted this law to prevent Russia from acting against US interests internationally.
It is worth mentioning that the US law was drafted in view of Russia's activities.
These include Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, and its interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Then suddenly a thousand-year-old secret was revealed.
This is the story of a man in Turkey who made a big discovery while doing house repairs.
When the wall of his basement broke down while he was doing repairs, he collided with a secret door.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he was confronted with a city thousands of years old hidden underground.
The pictures of this city show how about 20,000 people lived in this underground city with all their belongings and food and drink.
600 gates to enter the city:
The story goes back to 1963 when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered an underground city.
A wall in his basement collapsed while repairing the house.
Here, an underground city called Derinyuku was found, 280 feet below the surface.
Its depth was equal to an 18-story building.
This underground city was once home to 20,000 people, with everything from rooms, kitchen, school, church, tomb, etc. to ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit this city.
There are heavy gates here, which are meant to stop intruders from entering the underground city.
Each of its floors can be closed separately.
It is believed that the city was built between 780 and 1180 AD during the Byzantine period to protect the people from the Arab-Byzantine wars and natural disasters.
It has become a tourist attraction.
Derinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other cities like this but this is the biggest underground city.
It is only half of the city that can be reached but it has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
People come here to see it because of its historical and cultural significance.

Whether praying in mosque is an integral part of Islam, Supreme Court's decision today
The High Court is likely to render its decision on Thursday on petitions of Muslim group seeking a big bench review of the 1994 decision of the Supreme Court on the dispute over the ownership of Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid.
It is noteworthy that the High Court had said in its decision that praying in a mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
According to the news agency, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S Abdul Nazir will render their verdict on the back of the court.
The bench had safely held him on July 20.
M. Siddique, a fundamentalist in the Ayodhya case, had objected to this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the case of M. Israel Farooqi.
It stated that mosques are not an integral part of the prayers offered by the followers of Islam.
Siddique has died and is being represented by his legal heir.
The Muslim community argued before the Chief Justice-led bench that the decision needed to be reconsidered by a five-member bench on the observations of the High Court.
Because of the issue of Ram temple and land disputes.
Senior Advocate Rajiv Dhawan, speaking on behalf of Siddique's legal representative, said that the mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
The High Court made this comment without any kind of investigation or consideration of religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the Supreme Court that some Muslim communities are trying to delay the long-pending Ayodhya temple-mosque land dispute by demanding reconsideration of comments on the mosque not being an integral part of Islam.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, speaking on behalf of the Government, said that the dispute has been waiting for a final decision for almost a century.
The biggest drop in rupee, rupee has reached 71 against dollar
The Rupee has fallen 26 pence in the initial trading today, with the dollar demand rising amid rising crude oil prices, reaching a low of Rs 71.
The rupee against the dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market opened at Rs 70.95 yesterday and then moved to Rs 71.
The rupee stopped at 70.74 on Thursday.
Strong demand for US currency from oil importers at the end of the month, with interest rates rising in hopes of trade tensions between China and the US, as the dollar strengthened against other major currencies of the world, affected the domestic currency, according to currency traders.
The rising crude oil price and the rising inflationary fears and the exports from foreign institutional investors in the domestic stock market have also affected the rupee.
Standard Brite crude reached $78 a barrel at the start of Asian trade.
In the first meeting, Sachin made a prophecy about the earth.
Prithvi Shah has made his mark on the stars of the game by scoring a century on his Test debut.
Prithvi Shah is being compared to Sachin Tendulkar.
Just as Earth has played a big innings at school level, Sachin has also been in the innings.
Sachin Tendulkar tweeted his congratulations on the century scored by Prithvi Shah.
The first meeting was the prophecy that Sachin would take Earth Shan.
Sachin Tendulkar was also seen to be happy with this start of Prithvi Shan.
The Secretary also praised the earth.
Sachin recalled the day when he first saw Prithvi Shan batting and said something about him.
Sharing his experience, Sachin said that about 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chuhan once asked me to watch Prithvi Shan's batting.
'This young player wants to meet you and it would be great if you could meet him,' he said.
Sachin believed his friend and went to see his batting.
'He still remembers telling his friend that this boy would play for India one day,' Sachin said, 'he told his friend that you are looking at the future Indian cricketer.'
Then Sachin's friend said - are you telling the truth?
He said, "Remember my word, this child will play for India.
Sachin told about the greatest joy of the earth
Praising the earth-shaped, Sachin said, "What I have seen, it learns quickly.
It is different to have talent in a player but what you do with that talent is more important.
If you want to succeed in international cricket, you need to be able to learn quickly.
Adaptability is essential for playing for long periods of time in different terrains and conditions.
I think that Prithvi Shah has the ability to play the game in different situations and this is the greatest strength of the planet.
The coordinates of Prithvi Sha's hands and eyes are amazing.
The way he holds the line and the length of the ball is something that is seen in very few players.
This is a natural gift of the earth, which is not present in many players.

How could Sanskrit be the court language of Sultan Mahmud Ghazni, the Shaggar of the Somnath Temple and a villain to the common Indian?
In fact, it has become clear from the research of Professor Shantha Pandey, a historian at Delhi University, that Ghazni was a Sanskrit language.
Recently, when the Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr Gautam Patel and Dr Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to ask the question that Sanskrit was only a folk language or the language of the so-called upper-class Brahmins.
The memory of Pandit Gulaam Dastgir Biragdar of Mumbai was remembered.
Speaking in simple Sanskrit that even the poor can understand, the 87-year-old Pandit Biradadar is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Qur'an before its publication.
The word "Sanskrit" is the holy Qur'an.
+ Kur Ran means the voice or teaching of the messenger heard on earth.
Not only did he study in Solapur's school, but he is one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars in the country today.
However, Panditji, who lives a very simple life, does not seek to go to the US or other countries to lecture as a Sanskrit Pandit to market himself.
The Princess of Thailand is a Sanskrit scholar.
There he teaches himself Sanskrit.
To learn Sanskrit from America, the aspirants have to go to the University of Bonn in Germany.
In India, most universities except the Banaras Hindu University also have a Ph.D. thesis in Sanskrit written in the state language.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught in Gujarati, but remember that in the Takshila and Nalanda Universities, education was taught in Sanskrit medium.
Pr. Shantha Pandey said that not only was Sanskrit the language of the Sultan of Ghazni, but he also wrote his coins in Sanskrit.
Pandhe also noted that the coins "Mohammed Suratran" contained the importations of the Quran in Sanskrit and that the author of the Sanskrit grammar, Panini, was a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru in "My Hind Ka Darshan" has mentioned in a major chapter "The Power and Sustainability of Sanskrit Language" that the Pashto language of Afghans and Pathans is derived from Sanskrit.
Now it is accepted that not only the Indian languages but also the Indo-European languages have their origin in Sanskrit.
Another surprise for the national language advocates is that the chief architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and several other members of the Constituent Assembly, both Muslim and South Indian, proposed that Sanskrit should be the national language of the country.
When the Constitution Assembly discussed the issue of Hindi vs. English on 13 September 1949, the Deputy Foreign Ministers Dr. B. V. Keskar and Nazaruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language.
The discussion of that day and the report published in the National Herald on September 11, 1949, suggest the decline of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, even today we have not been able to decide on a national language.
22 Indian languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu have a place as the official language in our Constitution, but the National Language is not the only one.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Nehru through Sanskrit, the great Prime Minister, spoke about Sanskrit with great respect in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his book he turned to Sanskrit and detailed the importance that scholars around the world have given to Sanskrit: "In 1874 Sir William Jones said, 'God knows how ancient Sanskrit is, but it is a marvelous creation.
It is more complete than Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more noble than both.
Nehru further notes: "I do not know how long Sanskrit has been a dead language, i.e. when it has ceased to be a vernacular".
Today, Sanskrit is only the language of prayer or taking oath through members like Union Minister Smriti Irani as an MP.
We need to keep the year of Sanskrit alive and make it a folk language.
If the dead language of Israel, Hebrew, can be revived, then Sanskrit is a living language.
It is only worthwhile to make serious efforts to make it a popular language instead of making a show or symbolic efforts.

WhatsApp users can no longer do this work more than 5 times, soon will come feature
