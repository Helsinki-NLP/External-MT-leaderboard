A 9-year-old boy was found on the streets of Tampere
Police have been searching for a 9-year-old boy who was found in a car in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing boy who left West Tamper with a friend has been reported on social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and is not in danger to his life or health.
The boy's father told Night Snows at midnight knowing the boy had been found.
He's fine, and we're starting the follow-up.
The boy was found near the house, his father said.
Ronaldo is back on the scene . He 's a big shot .
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his performance in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League's painting feud turned, for a moment, in the latter's favor.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved to the top of the all-time scoring list alone after he hit a striker Shahtar Donetsk on the net with two penalty kicks and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his marathon to 80 when he had 77 hits at the Barcelona Messe before Tuesday.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus have been competing in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League D division they started strong with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal came 10 minutes before the end of the game for Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero, a quadriplegic.
Aguero, who was injured in a weekend soccer game, didn't get on the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester United's second team also suffered a hard time in the Netherlands after a 1-2 loss to PSV Endhoven.
The guest contest for 20-year-old ManU law enforcement official Luke Shaw lasted only a quarter of an hour.
The dangerous-looking slide call from PSV's Hector Moreno hit the paint towards the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw likely broke his ankle.
Shaw slept on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno's tied the game before the break.
The PSV winning goal came in the second half from Luciano Narsingh.
The season of the Champions League was marked by the start of the A-League Paris Saint-Germain.
The case involved the Argentine Angel Di Maria, who changed the shirt of Manchester United to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball past Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made it 2-0 at PSG in the second half.
PSG has been voted the best team of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league's minor league teams, is not the best possible reference point.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has faced his professional debut against Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsKA lost to Wolfsburg 0-1 in the B-League in Germany.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation . The president gave a wrong speech .
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, was giving the same speech he had a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has delivered the same speech to the country's parliament as he did at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised questions about the fullness of the 91-year-old Mugabe's powers.
The main opposition MDC has demanded Mugabe step down from his post because he is too old to rule.
Mugaye's aides rushed to say that the interference had taken place only in Mugaye's office and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was about China's impact on the economy.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have postponed an extra EU leaders' summit due to the refugee crisis.
President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who is leading the summits, will consider the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make their entry into Europe more efficient.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are on the table of the interior ministers, Merkel said.
Professor admits to shooting his girlfriend on the emergency call.
In an emergency call, University professor Shannon Lamb asked a voice-shaking police officer to come to his home and said he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was alive and probably scared, and the professor said that the contact details of the deceased woman's family were on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentice's body and a handwritten note on white paper that read: "I am very sorry and I hope I can recant my deed.
There was no sign in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 miles to the campus, and police found a professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, who was thought to have been shot dead, outside his study.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said the university's police department was notified of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after this.
One more death occurred the next day, and Lamb took his own life when the police caught up with him.
The next day, students and faculty were locked behind closed doors, and authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motives.
The researchers worked out the details of both locations, and the teachers who knew Lamb told them about the man, and the researchers had a picture of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's class.
According to the Gautier Police Department of the Prentice scene, the professor has no prior record of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned Lamb in a book in which he had acknowledged the "beautiful people" with whom he had been given the opportunity to spend his academic life.
Both worked in the department of social sciences and history, which had 17 faculty members, and many of the students attended the courses of both men.
However, there were indications of problems.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, said that the professor appeared agitated and nervous, "as if he had something wrong".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-2015 school year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied for medical leave from Delta State University because of some sort of health problem.
This year, she only taught two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's hiring policy meant that the claim Lamb had worked hard to make would not automatically guarantee him the position of assistant professor.
William LaForge, the university's rector, said he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly suffering from something.
These are the questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, the police found out which route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
Police were not immediately clear why Lamb had gone to this house, but Johnson said he believed the man knew the people who lived in the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began his career as a teacher of geography and education at a university with 3,500 students.
She got her PhD in education this spring.
One of Lamb's longest friends described her as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through her mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He was still in high school with friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"Lamb was a pretty heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were into him", said Hairston, now 40, who lives in Jackson's suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no record of them being consecrated.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house on a riverfront in the small town of Gauthier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said he and Prentiss divorced 15 years ago, and the couple remained friends, and they have a daughter, who is now 19.
"He was quite shocked", O'Steen said of his daughter.
"My daughter and her mother were best friends".
O'Steen had never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer show three years ago.
Later, they also played together sometimes.
According to O'Stein, his daughter composes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a lot of companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gauthier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5th, when Lamb was playing guitar and lip-syncing to a rare audience.
Nothing could deny that something was wrong.
"A happy couple", Shaffer said.
"We were joking together.
They both had a good sense of humor".
"The deceased Professor Schmidt conducted first-year seminars and specialized in the history of the Indians and the colonial period", said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and student body.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, 900 people gathered in candlelight for the memorial, including faculty, other staff, students, and local residents.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended a nighttime event where the university choir performed "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The class will resume Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back", LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day".
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press correspondents Emily Wagster Pettus from Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because police are now saying that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also clarified that even though Lamb referred to his wife Prentice on the emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us is not planning to hire as many seasonal workers as last year, but the toy and baby retailer says it is offering its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work overtime.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, and in 2014 it employed 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
The interviews for applicants will start this month and the new recruits will start in October and December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the commercial season is approaching at a good pace and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for retail stores and for the shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere night of Back to the Future was a defining moment in Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night was also personal.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed there was an empty seat next to me, and it was clear to me that Princess Diana was coming next to me", Fox told the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
"When the film began, I realized that the situation was very much like dating the Princess of Wales".
The documentary Back in Time is related to the films Back to the Future, and in addition to Fox, the documentary features interviews with Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely the time travel movie of all time for me", Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released on VOD and DVD and will be shown in select theaters starting in October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
Commenting on Russia's increased military action, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said there was no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons were only bringing more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General reiterated his call on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he planned to meet the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would be timed to coincide with the UN General Assembly's Ministerial Week later this month.
Mr Ban regretted that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers had created a situation that is impossible to resolve.
Ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis, similar to the one achieved by the Iran nuclear deal.
Chapter 8 of the supporting questions: Is Donald Trump serious?
There's been a lot of talk about Trump being a talkie.
He's also been thought to be a joke.
Part of it predicts Trump's collapse.
Republican circles have (so far) tried to pull Trump off the race.
Eleven of the 11 national galleries are showing double-digit numbers of votes in favor of Donald Trump, and some are already seriously considering what it actually says about the real estate mogul's chances of running.
But the election is only in its early stages.
Nowhere has Trump been announced as the Republican nominee.
Experts say that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was in the ballot box, was given the floor to the upcoming Herman Cain, and neither of them eventually won the state election.
Trump would have a hard time in the general election for a number of reasons.
External groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and begun digging into his image of defeat.
The following recent Gallup data show that the real estate market cannot be overlooked by the rolling stock:
There's been a complete change in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University Gallup, only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of real estate.
By mid-July, 40 percent had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the same proportion was 52%.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures also apply to the states where elections are held first.
In the Quinnipiac poll last week, 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy with Trump's candidacy.
In a CNN and ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were very happy or satisfied with Trump's possible candidacy.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson is getting almost as enthusiastic a reception as Trump (43% would be very happy with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next favorite candidate?
Third is Marco Rubio, with a similar 21% share.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected as the party's nominee.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his arrogance and offensive comments, with 52 percent of Republican supporters nationwide saying the properties of the real estate mogul are appropriate for the president, according to a poll by ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the party's first congress is being held: According to Quinnipiac Gallup, 52 percent of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities appropriate to the commander-in-chief of the military.
However, according to the ABC and Post Gallup, 44 percent believe Trump is not capable of acting effectively in his role, and six in 10 consider Trump's temperament to be unsuitable for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is most likely to be the party's nominee, according to CNN and the ORC Gallup, four in ten believe Trump's chances.
Things have changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Overall, Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry was a likely candidate, and only 28 percent thought Mitt Romney was.
The majority seems to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans backed another candidate, Trump will cover up almost every other candidate.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump's opponents divide into supporters of different candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September revealed that in a fictional duel between Trump and almost anyone else's Republican nomination, Trump would almost always have a larger supporting cast.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14, Walker by 15, Jeb Bush by 19, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's on a level playing field with Ted Cruz.
Is Cruz the only real opponent of Trump?
Ben Carson would have won Trump by 19 points in a fictional duel.
A small majority of Trump supporters say they've already made a vote.
According to a Gallup poll by CBS and the NYT on Tuesday, half of Trump's supporters are confident in their vote.
The situation can change for many reasons, and at the moment a confident voter can also change his mind.
Forty-six percent of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's most competitive candidate right now is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
In his campaign speech two months ago, Donald Trump called for immigrants from Mexico to be raped. Immigration has been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's powerful speeches will drive key Latin American voters out of the Republican ranks and hinder the brand's renewal.
But according to poll results from ABC News and the Washington Post published Monday, six out of 10 Republicans are on immigration issues along the same lines as Trump.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Discontent with the administration is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently hold about half the Republican vote, and the fact that they both ran as outsiders is a significant addition to the popular vote.
The Republican Party wants a fresh face for the candidate instead of a political junkie, according to the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, which found that six out of ten Republicans felt the same way.
These two candidates are also angry at Washington.
According to a Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa poll, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the Republican action in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent are angry".
Jeremy Corbyn made his debut at the prime minister's interview.
The Prime Minister's first meeting after the election is expected to be held in prime time.
Labour's new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to rise for the first time to cast his vote in a later interview with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn is asking his first six questions shortly after noon, and the media and Labour are closely following him.
Corbyn has been making less of a theater announcement and adding facts to a weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first to weigh Corbyn's leadership in relation to the parliamentary test now being taken after the shadow cabinet meeting and his speech at TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.
The Labour Party's decision to remain silent during the national anthem at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the UK's war on climate on Tuesday has been criticised by several Tory party representatives and has made headlines in several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem drew attention.
A Corbyn spokesman said Corbyn stood during the national anthem, quietly paying tribute to the Royal Air Force's heroism in the Battle of Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow cabinet, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite opposition from this monarchy.
The 10th Shadow Secretary has refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing disagreements over economic, defence and foreign affairs, with less than a sixth of the party initially supporting Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant believes that political disagreements over Britain's EU membership and the government's tightening of benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told the TUC meeting that Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, the shadow Labour and Pensions Minister Smith said the party's position was very clear: it was only opposed to the government's plans to lower the threshold from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to be faced by David Cameron in the last decade as leader of the Tory Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a new approach to politics, says he chose the questions to be asked by Cameron from the audience out of 30,000 proposals he received.
Corbyn, who was elected for Islington North, said the poll was too much of a conflict, and he promised to avoid clever wording and slurry, saying he would instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Shadow Secretary Angela Eagle visits him during interviews, for example when Cameron is on a foreign trip.
Mr Corbyn has also thrown the idea that others could sometimes vote, and he says he discussed this with John Bercow, the Speaker of the House.
When Corbyn took office in 2005, Cameron said he wanted a puppetry policy, often linked to questioning, but admitted several years later that he had failed in his bid.
Since the first time the polling hour was televised in 1990, it has been considered a key measure of the manager's judgment, management and position in the lower house, but critics say that it has become a caricature that needs to be significantly reformed.
"Shot in Joburg" - from homeless young photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
For the former group of pundits, there's a sensible way to learn and earn money.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a nonprofit film studio that teaches homeless youths to photograph their homes and earn money.
BBC News met a young man who graduated first in his class through the project.

The pound will strengthen as UK wages rise
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK and SABMiller pulled up the FTSE 100 index.
In the United Kingdom, wages rose by 2.9% in July compared with the same period last year, excluding bonuses.
The projected faster growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1%, and its exchange rate was quoted at $1,5505.
The FTSE 100 Index increased by 1,49% to 6,229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, which lost 20% when it received an initial offer from a competitor, AB InBevil.
The deal would bring together the world's two largest bakeries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share of the positive results of the competing luxury-focused Richemont Group rose by 0.9%.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than predicted, and sales were also increasing in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's stake rose 5% after the miner announced its intention to raise $2.5 billion in equity loans as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The largest drop in shares of Mond, a packaging and paper group, was a 4.3% drop when Goldman Sachs lowered the company's share price for sale.
JD Sports's turnover increased by 3,1% after the sports company was informed that its pre-tax profit would increase by 83% to £46,6 million.
JD Sports: higher wage costs could hamper expansion
Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Executive Board, said that an increase in the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroots campaign against the Aldi outbreak
Metcash is trying to secure its IGA store from Aldi's takeover of South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to preserve the market share of IGA retail stores in South and Western Australia against the A$700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia by the beginning of next year, with Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand by marketing it through mainstream media and social media, as well as hosting events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA shops and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers snacks at IGA shops, and dealers sell tickets to buyers at discounted prices for South Australian Football League games.
Metcash is expected to publish more details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when the Food, Alcohol and Iron Trading Authority will host the annual Investment Strategy Day.
These are significant markets, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores and the coverage in these regions is higher than that of the IGA network in the Eastern States.
The South and West Australian consumers are known for their cornering, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with a market share of 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, compared with only 14% in the Eastern States.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will take 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
This week Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA traders could reach 360 million in sales and Metcash could reach 250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and will reach sales of $500 million and $600 million in those regions.
The fixed costs of Metcash are high, so a loss in sales and volume of food could mean a loss of $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
Meanwhile, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a market share of EUR [...] million in the Union.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the chief wallet manager at Magellan Financial Group, told an event in Melbourne that he considered it highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within 10 years.
Metcash has refused to take a public stand on Douglas' comments.
It's understandable that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the turnover of the Metcash food business, which serves 1200 IGA resellers, has fallen by 43% from the 2012 level, reflecting a reduction in debt financing as a result of the pressure on sales and coverage.
However, the supplier is taking action, with an annual turnover of over A$150 million, to meet the prices of hundreds of products on a weekly basis for Coles and Woolworths.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor rating system in the Union.
The president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy defends Thanasi Cook
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention for his behavior rather than criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the casualty of a recent riot involving Nick Kyrgios.
The younger of the duo, dubbed "Special K", Kokkinakis, was thrown into a disadvantageous spotlight when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the ATP tournament in Montreal.
Soon after that, in a brawl between Cook and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate the two rivals twice. "Wawrinkan should have turned his back on Kyrgios and my friend", Harrison said.
In the US Open, Cookinakis hit a frustrated mile on the field when a strong cramp ruined his match.
The teen star is currently in Glasgow, where he is fighting Sam Groth behind singles runner-up Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute", Healy said.
"He broke the record when he lost the US Open, and he's not the first player to break the record because of frustration, and I know Thanas well enough not to be proud of what he's done.
But he has endured very well, for example, Harrison's provocative behavior in the open, and I think he deserves credit.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's very mature at 19, he's a hard worker, he's a good addition to the team, he's never had any problems with other players, and he's respected among the players, he's a hard worker, he's in good shape, and he's a really stable and mature young man, and I think he should be judged by his own sea-traits".
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team in the important round starting on Friday, describing the decision as a joint decision for all parties, but he supported the return of Canberra's relegation as a long-term reinforcement of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on the games rather than the Kyrgios controversy", Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly, and as Federer and Murray have pointed out, for example, the youngster will grow up in the spotlight, and he deserves the criticism he gets for his bad mistakes, but we try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions, and we try to make him feel at peace with himself, and I believe that's the best thing for the whole team and for Nick".
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border on Tuesday and seized illegal immigrants to block the flow of migrants.
Chaos erupted at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in no-one's country, and Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to remain indefinitely in their tents on the roads between the country's checkpoints
The frustration started to surface.
As a police helicopter flew over the migrants, they shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police.
Some of them protested at the food and drink rally.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that he would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation must be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and in other countries as well,' Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The border dispute between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when a group of 28 states failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the flood of 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared and hoped that an agreement would be reached by the end of next month or year on which EU Member States would take in 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extra summit on Tuesday for the next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary, however, did not hope for immediate action by Brussels or the neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the state of emergency developed to the point that in two southern regions authorities were able to take more effective measures to close roads and speed up legal proceedings on asylum matters.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary was also planning a barbed wire fence to block the flow of migrants to the Romanian border from that direction, now that the fence at the Serbian border is already complete.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were taking part in a bidding contest to finish the Hungarian-Serbian spike-line.
In recent months, migrants from Hungary have become a clear bottleneck and a transit point for the European Union, many of whom are refugees from Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that the majority of people arriving are life-long refugees, not war refugees entitled to seek asylum, a view that was sharply different from that of other EU countries, including Germany.
In Hungary, a new law, which came into force at midnight, makes it a crime to exceed or damage a four-meter-high barbed wire fence that the government has built along the southern border with Serbia, and also provides for longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
"We're following a strict line: crossing the border illegally is a crime".
In practice, Parliament still has to approve military action, which is expected next week.Reporters at the border have seen heavily armed soldiers in their vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the Orban's internal security adviser, said authorities have seized 45 border crossings attempted immediately at the border and 15 further.
Even people who crossed the border by harming the border are now in police custody, charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities are repairing the fence quickly.
Hungary also closed two of seven border crossing points on Tuesday, including one with a railway car covered in a spike.
Chaos swept through the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal box to a business point where people packed in.
About 20 people could get in, but thousands were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road between Serbia and Hungary, and people reportedly said they were in a food and drink bar until they were allowed to return to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership shrank by half compared to Bernie Sanders, according to the National Gallup.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's two-digit turnout for the Democratic nomination for president is still high, but Senator Bernie Sanders has widened the gap.
Clinton now has 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%) while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his potential for the presidency, and his support among Democrats is 15 percent.
More than five months before the primary, it's too early for most Democrats to say who they're for.
But Clinton's supporters are more confident than the other candidates.
After the CBS News scandal last month, Clinton has lost the support of several Democratic parties, while Sanders' camp has added new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong leadership position among women and moderates, but leadership has shrunk.
Clinton's popularity among men has dropped significantly, and he's only 5% ahead of Sanders.
Clinton has lost her leadership position among Democrats under 50, and she's now on a par with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's lead in the presidential vote was double-digit among the Liberals over Sanders, but now Sanders has taken a five-percent necklace to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats say they would be happy to support Clinton if he were elected as the party's nominee.
Four would support Clinton with a small reservation, and 15 percent would support him just because he's a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic if he were elected.
There seems to be a greater dispersion among those who are not currently in favor of Clinton, and only about a quarter would be enthusiastic about her support.
48 percent of Democrats would support Clinton, while only 35 percent of Republicans would be eager to support the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
When asked to freely describe why they support Clinton's candidacy, the most popular reasoning is Clinton's own experience (16 percent), the second most popular answer being that it's time to choose a female president (13 percent), and the third that Clinton is the best candidate for the office (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also cite his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The Commission also discusses the consensus on the possibility of winning the actual elections.
The vice president is still questioning his potential for a candidate, and 57% of Democrats would like him to run, and a third would prefer to keep him out.
When the Democratic voters question the second most popular candidate for the party's nomination, the majority will choose Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton will increase her lead to Sanders, which is 20 percentage points if Sanders is in the race, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't run.
55% of Democrats say Clinton is the candidate with the best chance of winning the primary, but that's down from 78% last month.
Biden, who is second, is far from Clinton, but more and more people believe Biden's chances of winning the real election.
But the Democrats are more concerned with the chances of winning candidates than with their views on the issues.
The voters do not consider it impossible to accept any Democratic or potential candidates.
Voters consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate for their characteristics.
Most people think of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, trustworthy, and the type of leaders.
Biden is often characterized as being honest, while Clinton is often seen as the type of leader.
Up to 30% of Democrats don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, 15% don't think Sanders is honest, 27% don't know whether Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters say the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the voters' own ideology.
And for all the attributes, about a quarter of the people don't have an opinion on Sanders.
When voters are asked what they think about Hillary Clinton's private email and her own servers as secretary of state, most Democratic voters say they are happy with Clinton's explanation, and it hasn't changed the way these voters view Clinton.
The American people, on the whole, disagree.
Half of Americans are unhappy with Clinton's report, and only a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
A majority of Americans feel that the use of controversial emails has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the picture has changed in a negative direction.
Most of these 36 percent, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While voters in his own party consider Clinton to be honest and credible, these qualities can be improved when asked about the views of all voters: Clinton is only 32% honest and credible, down 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points from May.
62 percent of all voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55 percent of all voters across the country also don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump both get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates who were interviewed, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most trusted.
The majority of the people think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The poll has 351 voters and a margin of error of 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is clamouring for Donald Trump's lead in a national poll.
According to the latest polling by CBS News and the New York Times, Ben Carson has overtaken Donald Trump.
These two candidates received more than half of the vote in the new poll, leaving the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has strong support among Republican voters across the country, up from 23% in a CBS poll last month before the Fox News debate, which was released Tuesday, and is 27%.
Carson's support, however, rose sharply over the same period, from 6 percent to 23 percent.
The poll found Carson to have strong support in all segments of the population, and in the higher education group, he's outperforming Trump.
The other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are out, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is the weakest, falling from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared third place with 6 percent support.
The margin of error in the 376 Republican votes is 6% in one direction or another.
According to the most recent CNN and ORC poll released last week, Carson's support is on the rise, with 19 percent of Republicans supporting him, while Trump's is 32 percent.
Also in the most recent ABC News and Washington Post poll, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
In a recent meeting with men last week, Trump filed unfounded charges against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said Saturday during his campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the faculty charged with the death of a Baruch College Fox.
Nearly two years ago, five people were charged with murder after the death of a student at a parish ritual in Pocon Hill, Pennsylvania.
Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Psi faculty members brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during a September 2013 bathing ceremony.
Officials said that the victim's eyes were tied, a 40-pound [15 kg] sand-filled hole was placed on his back, and he had been repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target located across the ice field.
Dengi is said to have first complained of a headache and then lost consciousness.
Police say that Pi Delta Psi team members did not call the emergency number when Deng passed out, and they were supposed to wait an hour before taking him to the hospital.
Police Chief Chris Wabner told a news conference that members were given time to change Dengi's clothes, google his symptoms and contact department chairman Andy Mengi.
"At this point, members began to hide tools, putting the interests of the department ahead of Michael Deng's health", Wagner said.
Dengi was never resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Dengi was hit multiple times in the head, upper chest and legs with a dull object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the department's shrinkage, with at least one student per year dying from the shrinkage since 1970", states Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengi family.
The provinces and their members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
The Monroe County Superior Court has indicted five members of the district on charges of third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the department are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to get accountability not only for individuals but also for an organization that has officially or unofficially approved the symposium", Wagner told a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the department, and the National Department resigned from the local department.
This is how the Fed's interest rate hike affects the US
The rise in interest rates and the upturn in the stock market are crashing, the yield on securities is rising and the economy is slipping.
We know that.
And we don't know how long it takes or how long the effects last.
In particular, in the economic context, we find in history a reference to timing.
The Lama has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate hike and has lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, but not always, and the response of the economy and financial resources is decisive.
Therefore, the central bank officials have already emphasised that investors should pay attention not to when the interest rate hike starts but to how long it will take to normalize the situation.
Of course, there are a number of variables involved.
However, in the end market participants may find that any distortion of interest rate increases may be exaggerated.
"The first recovery from the central bank since the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money", Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, told his clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level.
But that doesn't mean there aren't any effects.
Here are examples of how the impact can be seen in different sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the trend of interest rate increases may increase volatility for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the impact isn't so dramatic.
'The trend would appear to be a standstill of capital yields for 12 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting a delay in monetary policy, said an analyst at Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the consequences of the interest rate hike.
Over a specified period of 35 years, the market will generally see a sharp rise in interest rates, around 14%, rather steady over the next 250 days (average increase of 2.6%) and a normal situation after 500 days, with an average interest rate return of 14.4% after six shares, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutschen, the effect on shares is usually strengthened at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income begins to decline.
The economy is in a state of emergency, but interest rates generally do.
In this case, if the central bank faces circumstances that did not exist before and could accelerate the downward trend.
It is particularly noteworthy that GDP is at its lowest ever for the central bank to raise its central rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice in the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 has the nominal value been below 4.5%.
While the second quarter of 2015 looks like 3.6 percent, many did not expect it to be sustainable, and in the third quarter it will be 1.5 percent, reports the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
In this sensitive economic situation, interest rates can be raised at risk and it is questionable whether this is different, Deutsche said.
Market participants have been talking about the increase in the central rate throughout the year, and they are looking forward to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approved the increase at this meeting, the likelihood of futures trading is only 25%.
"In our studies from 1950 to the present, all upward cycles have been in a supercycle, with GDP rising very rapidly after the upward trend begins even before the downward trend", states the report.
The recovery has been extremely slow compared to the worst episode of the season.
The cycle is clearly the longest the central bank has been waiting for since the last banking year, with a record of 35 months, now in its 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been volatile during the early stages of interest rate movements and the pattern is also repeated on the capital side.
'The fundamental difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when the central bank changes its course.
For group bonds, the yield appears to change direction immediately after the first up/down cycle starts.
At the end of the upward cycle, the yields will fall immediately', Deutsche stated.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring long- and short-term bonds closer together and the curve will level.
"High-yield bonds often do better in this environment, even though we are still cautious about returns", said Kathy Jones, a Schwab firm securities analyst.
Interestingly, Jones said the markets are already adjusting to the central bank's upcoming change in direction.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already signs of adjustment to tightening fiscal policy", Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased, all of which are typical of a market where the central bank is tightening policy.
In general, companies operating mainly in the US market benefit as interest rates fall and local products start to attract.
The outlook for indebted multinational companies is weaker, as the strengthening dollar causes their products to slump in global markets and debt to slump.
"History shows that quality stocks will be more profitable in the next three months", Goldman Sachs analysts tell their clients.
The companies with strong balance sheets outperformed the weak ones after the interest rates of 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
The companies with high returns on capital and low volatility stocks also performed worse in quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better respectively.
"Light is a big question.
The companies with the largest share of variable-rate debt are the ones with the biggest losses", Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers generally also benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects can be seen.
Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio station for overpopularizing it.
Bingham says it's hard to tell the difference between a commercial channel and a competitor these days.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards trophy is a copy of the British trophy.
In turn, the parliamentarian Damien Collins blames The Voice for his personality.
According to a significant parliamentary failure, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of Classic FM, and the allegations are putting pressure on the station to prove that it is offering other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the broadcaster's radio channel was becoming too populist and it was hardly distinguishing itself from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularity, but Radio 3 seems to be moving towards Classic FM", Bingham said.
Also in December, the BBC Music Awards received criticism from Bingham for:
"The first BBC Music Awards last year seems to be a copy of the British Awards.
These two are examples of what is already on the market, rather than what is new and different", says Bingham.
The BBC's chief executive denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 had a significantly more live music and educational content than its commercial competitor.
"I learned something from classical music at Radio 3 that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and making music is in a class of its own.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works", said the CEO.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said the station needed to work harder to keep the audience interested, as the British get to know classical music better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel to have received criticism for having been harshly involved in commercial channels in the limited cultural, media and sport committee hearing.
Damien Collins, a Tory MP, criticized The Voice's talent contest, which the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media, for an estimated £22million.
"The program is not discussed much, because it is not unique or particularly distinctive".
Lord Hall said the BBC1 show, which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as the stars, was produced for the BBC in a typical way.
Collins also demanded that the company search its own store for the hit show when it launches a new series.
However, Collins refused to rule out the continuation of the ordering of The Voice or the use of taxpayer money for other entertainment formats.
The slowest ever growth in online commerce in August  probably due to Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The number of online sales has been increasing since 2000.
Online shopping was reinforced three years ago with mobile shopping.
Experts believe that the November Black Friday may help to curb shopping.
The decade-long online commerce boom has left many of Britain's shopping trends empty.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor protection scheme in place.
In August, overall sales growth was the slowest in the whole period since the year 2000 when online sales were recorded, with an increase of only 5% last year.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor protection scheme in place.
"When you compare last year's growth to the 2000 census, it is clear that growth will level off over time", IMRG editor-in-chief Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian.
Mulcahy says online shopping picked up momentum three years ago when consumers embraced mobile shopping.
"It made it possible for more and more people to shop online, and for many people to shop in different environments, even from home.
With mobile shopping now more moderate, growth can be even".
Black Friday, originating in America, is a phenomenon considered to be one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
Experts say that a theme day on the last Friday in November could cause consumers to postpone their purchase decision before Black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online shoppers compared to normal, many merchants dropped their websites.
Experts believe that a Black Friday that makes consumers rush to bidding can restrain their buying habits during the rest of the season.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, one in five pounds of fair money was spent online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in fashion stores.
The costumes are buried in the elevator, the victims, the Bin Laden family is responsible.
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has claimed that the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The health ministry also said 394 people were injured after the elevator fell.
The bodies were carried in high air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the elevator that fell on the Great Mosque of Mecca
Crowds of people dressed in white had gathered in the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their final journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
Surusaattue was walking through a pilgrimage site where a fallen builder had just penetrated the Muslims' roof of a mosque the day before.
The King of Saudi Arabia is demanding that bin Laden's family construction company be held responsible for the crash, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims of the hijacking accident at the Grand Mosque were transported on the streets.
Among the dead after the fall of Nosturi was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents, who were beginning their year-long pilgrimage to the Hajj.
Saudi authorities have agreed to organize a Hajj pilgrimage as thousands of people arrive in the city for the pilgrimage.
King Salman said Binladin Group should not have left the lifts up when the lifts were not in use.
According to an Arabic press release, the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language news service of the news agency did not report in detail, but according to the English-language press release, the Group's management has been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to expose the cause of the fall of the elevator in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, and thousands of Muslims will head to their Great Mosque for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any information on the lifting accident and no representatives of the group have been contacted for an opinion.
The King also accused the company of failing to comply with the latest safety regulations and cooperating with meteorological experts.
Dozens of lifts surrounded the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of Binlad Group's massive construction project.
The bin Laden family has had close ties to the Saudi Arabian government for decades, and bin Laden is responsible for several major construction projects.
The late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade boy who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The rainstorm and high winds caused the lifting accident just days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every capable Muslim is obliged to do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a payment of one million riyals (about EUR 250 000) for the families of the victims and the permanently disabled.
The other victims of the accident will receive half of the compensation.
B&Q boss says low-cost eastern European labour is behind the phenomenon
"Brits are hiring homeowners more and more often", says Veronique Laury.
The popularity of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has increased.
Over 200 new Screwfix stores are opening for workers.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores around the country.
The text is by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent, Daily Mail.
The British are said to be transferring the house's painting and sculpture to the makers arriving from Eastern Europe.
The art of drawing and painting seems to be rare today.
The UK is now increasingly hiring home-grown people to do home-grown work, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home improvement stores, and Laurie says the phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at high prices.
As a result of the revelation, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new retailers' Screwfix stores, with 60 B&Q stores closing.
Laury needs more female workforce in B&Q stores because eight out of 10 purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
Right now, most of the staff is men.
Lauryn says that the trend in population should be considered, since today more and more single women are also building their homes.
"The majority of our store staff is still men", says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of our product purchases are made by women.
Women have a significant role in the decision-making process".
Laury is one of five women in the FTSE 100 list of UK companies and has also reorganised the company's management team to provide a gender-equal headcount.
Kingfisher is almost unique in its kind, with women making up 50% of its staff, including its CEO and CFO.
"This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important issue for us", Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board".
Kingfisher's six-month sales and profits are down, despite the fact that the company has been working hard since the closure of its stores.
Kingfisher is responding to the latest trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three-axis government decided to resort to compulsory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite rapid.
The sharp head of SAK and other wage-earners' centers began to be forced on the spot, and as a result the country stands up on Friday because of the large protest of workers.
I think a lot of people think that makes sense.
We'll ask if it's worth the strike, if it's going bad.
There's even been a resistance movement.
Over 50,000 people have already gone online to say they're not going to participate in the demonstration, they're going to work.
In the old days of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but to openly declare yourself a criminal would have been the political suicide of a small man.
The protests of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions do not take much time, but they give us reason to think.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement for themselves, the values have changed
In view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's harsh solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seemingly self-imposed pressure, the unions are finally getting to the point of defending workers' rights, clearly and properly.
The government may thus wish to reinforce the role of the ay movement when membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever we think about the activities of these organizations, it is absurd that a Friday protest would stop Finland.
Finland has stopped long ago.
For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
GDP continues to decline and unemployment continues to rise.
I'd think these things would make everyone's head spin.
A strong savings target for the University of Lappeenranta: 8.5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta is launching a savings programme with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8,5 million.
As part of the savings, the University is launching negotiations on the total staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million a year.
In practice, that means a reduction of about 130 employees.
The other activities are aimed at a further saving of 2 million.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which forecasts a deficit of 8,5 million for actual activity.
This will also be affected by the government's budget cuts.
During this financial year, the university produces approximately 2.6 million shortcomings.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but the same Ministry's funding will be reduced by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million.
The total budget of the University is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The impact of massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding is showing up at new levels.
The negotiations with the trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as required by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to go to Finland
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of Onnibus, a low-cost bus company, told Yelle that the company also aims to operate rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Souter says.
The railway sector is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the nearby transport of the capital area in 2017-2018.
After the nearby traffic, it's the long distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approaching the Department of Transportation.
The Ministry of Transport has said that the plans for Onnibus are welcome.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least by Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services in other parts of Europe.
The time of interest rate decision at the US central bank
The world is watching Wednesday and Thursday's Fed meeting to decide on a possible rate hike for the first time in nearly a decade.
The fair share of economists who believed that the central bank would raise interest rates last week now bet that it would keep the current rate of interest at 0.25%, according to a survey of 80 economists by Reuters.
"This is a historic situation, as the central bank has kept interest rates at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus start normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars in excess to the balance sheet and has only slightly accelerated inflation.
The central bank cannot ignore the global situation, however, which is not as rosy.
It has urged the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications that the opposite is true.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 8pm Central European time.
The shooter at Delta State University left a note apologizing .
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before a colleague was shot later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message apologizing for the first murder and hoping to undo it, authorities said Tuesday.
Lamb , who teaches geography and social science at Delta State University in Gautier , Mississippi , called the emergency number at about 10 a.m.
Monday and told me he shot a man.
Lamb called the police at his house.
"I shot my wife last night", Lamb said, adding that there was a friendly dog in the house who was okay with anyone but probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but he wouldn't tell us.
Lamb didn't even give us the motive for the shooting.
Police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note by Lamb that read: "I am very sorry and I wish I could call it off.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 miles to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late Monday when police caught up with him.
William LaForge, the university's rector, said he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly suffering from something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but authorities said Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triple drama.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Princess for seven years, characterized his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
He said that his daughter and her mother were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles admitted that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others", Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his family on Monday and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that same night, Lamb stopped the car, ran off on foot, ran into the woods, and took his own life.
According to the university's website, Lamb earned her Ph.D. in Education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
The stars are dimmed
The last few years have been difficult for the actor (pictured on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
Everything that happened has really been taxing.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been missing for months for two fractures.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in a Champions League game against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will be unfortunately forced to stay in the side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the side this season.
Shaw, 20, was injured in a PSV defensive zone in Héctor Moreno's bad grip after 15 minutes of play.
Shaw received first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two broken legs, and he's in the hospital", Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery.
The youngster who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has been through a lot and is now injured after a great game.
Shaw was given oxygen in the dressing room.
The man was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when he breaks his leg in two places, he's out for six months and he's not playing in a blockbuster anymore.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno had little effect on the situation, as the red card was not followed by a penalty kick.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can judge for yourself, but I think it was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-legged, hollow block".
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you for all your messages, and I cannot express how devastated I am, and my recovery will begin here and I will return stronger".
More on the subject: Manchester United side Luke Shaw in the PSV match
The English defender has a special reason to recover from the European Championship in France in June.
"There is a very serious injury in the case", said the PSV coach.
"In such cases of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
The object of the players is never to harm the opponent".
Moreno broke his leg while playing for the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup in Mexico.
"He is very sorry because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and it is sad to hear that the injury is serious", Cocu said.
"I didn't even see the situation.
I just saw a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's grip".
"I know how it feels, I know how difficult a situation like this can be", Moreno told SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm really sorry".
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better .
Every parent soon realizes that their child is learning their favorite book almost from the outside.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the children's holiday agency asked Cameron to name his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose Lorax, a 1971 environmental story by Dr. Seuss.
In a post on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching, creative, and it has a powerful message, and I love to read it to my children because there's always something that we haven't noticed before".
Sounds good, except that the next point Cameron is going to be describing the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 movie version, which added new characters and details to complement the brief opening lines.
"In a city of need where real trees and plants have been lost and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted lives, who wants to get his dream into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by making this dream come true: to see a real tree", says the text.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is in part consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database, which begins: "In a city of necessities where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey".
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so foreign to him, as Ahne Kerskane destroys trees and makes them the Needs of the title character, despite the objections of Lorax, a small, thick, bearded creature who protects the forests.
Probably a little pr-task like this has been entrusted as an assistant, apparently to someone who hasn't read Lorax 20 times as a kid.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the text was likely from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment on the matter in detail, but confirmed that the text was handwritten by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being cut from the England squad, but it's still tough.
Facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but seeing the team selected for the tour of England lose the last 3-0 Test series is not to be expected.
I wouldn't rule out a chance of winning a guest.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three-year-old side, but the batting team has good players and the attitude of the team is strong  they have no bad experience in 2012, only young positivity.
As a footballer, Moeen Ali is developing as a goalkeeper, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test experience, represents the offensive option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is clearly difficult for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good ones against challenging conditions, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are judged on their results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I've said before, the players are the best selectors.
A few 50-point games would have been enough for Lyth to play, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he wasn't doing as well as he could have, which doesn't surprise me.
The question of how long the test beans will have a chance to make an impact is difficult.
Lyth won seven national titles, as did his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only complaint is perhaps that England first used Jonathan Trot in the Caribbean when Lyth was at his peak. But this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's a hitter I value very much.
He's a cricketer of unknown origin, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He must have at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this depends of course on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
There's been a lot of talk about Moe starting a strikeout with Cook, giving us an extra point guard while keeping four quick-forwards, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see any reason why a top batsman could be hitting here, and this left-hander has already proven himself to be a great cricketer.
Moe may not have achieved much for his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been a third-string player for the team, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Tests as a first-class substitute before being called up in 2001.
He scored three hundred points in one go and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is a reserve midfielder for the team, and from what I've seen of him, he's proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his stats  on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 points as a pitcher  and this can be a searching spree, but very many goaltenders have not shown that they are ready, and the selectors decided to take the young player.
He's gonna learn a lot on this road trip.
Outside the playing team, England seem to have made a few clever choices for their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a Test adviser could be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most sweet men in the species, and he brings a lot of experience, because he's played under all kinds of conditions and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the White Ball game, bringing energy and ruthlessness.
I think he's always had an impact on the proper international cricket, whether he was a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a stimulus.
Collin's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, has been laid to rest for one day, Root has had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don't set a match schedule.
And it must be remembered that, like players, their jobs depend on results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
The Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017.
David Cameron's halfway strategy of renegotiating Britain's stay in the EU is becoming increasingly popular, even without the "yes or no" Jeremy Corbyn's choice of Labour or TUC as leader, who mocks Europe fiercely on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragensa.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is involved in, even though not all of them are responsible for, and some Member States are tired of the British agenda of self-indulgence, which includes disagreeable concessions and damaging amendments to the Treaty that they don't even want.
At the annual TUC Congress in Brighton, it was decided that they too would not enjoy the EU if it were to crush social security.
I guess we could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking figures, return home and tell them they have acquired Allied reforms.
It's all about me.
To my European friend who wants a broad-eyed Britain inside the EU. 'Don't leave us alone with France,' says Berlin, suggesting that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have reached the point where it no longer matters whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the sensible German Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it goes bad, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Holland is up for re-election or the election of his successor in 2017.
His power is slipping.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government and Spain a left-wing government.
It's hard to imagine them running around helping the British who could use their energy better to try to stop Scotland from leaving the UK, and they don't want to, because most of them have separatist leanings.
Some of these ministers may plan to deliberately make useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the 2017 UK election campaign to try to force the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The negotiations were an orderly affair, and Britain had no intention of renegotiating.
Europeans know how the British press is hunting and how the EU-skeptic oligarchic press is, just like the 1975 referendum by Tony Benn, which gave a 2:1 vote in favour of EU accession in 1973.
Some may recall Boris Johnson, a knife-edged euro-opportunist who became known as "our direct EU banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax evasion, hacking of phones, and seemingly temporary settlements that own most of our good news.
Actually, Tony Blair thought pretty much the same thing about them, but then he realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to spread the bananas for a snack so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was Blair's most liberal opponent in the referendum, and Blair gave his assent to the EU constitution, which was then rejected.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly slapped me on the back at Westminster on Monday, I told him he didn't have time to waste on me anymore, and there might be a risk that he would adopt Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s.
Time may pass, but Corbyn must develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, whose BBC show he sat on on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside the Ukip and Tory parties will probably answer yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Benniitti" Benn said on radio and television this week when his inner patrolman tried to avoid admitting that Corbyn had a bad taste in appointing the tough John McDonnell Shadow Secretary of State for Finance.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father had a hard time being unfaithful to his Labour colleagues on television without going too far and losing his seat in the lower house.
Hilary's problems were more interesting.
Mr Benn said he was opposed to remaining in the EU "under all circumstances", but Mr McDonnel did not, nor did he say so to his colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday night.
And if Corbyn wanted to convey any image that I could see, I have to remember that he touched me, and the key is important in a 24/7 age, especially in a social media age where paranoia and deception are rampant.
We have to make sure that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
The equivalency between McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership is a testament to the island economy and anti-capitalist past, and the debate is no longer confined to the narrow circle of leftist dissidents for whom the idea of similarity is a key lesson in doctrinal disputes.
The European Parliament has also been called upon to take a decision on the future of the European Union, and to take a decision on the future of the European Union.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, they have questionable voters, why should they make concessions to Britain when everything can be useless?
The United States has already been pretty disappointed in the British poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the Tory government cuts, and I was reminded of that on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the UK authorities' statements on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims made by the state-funded institution that smoking e-cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were made at a meeting in which 12 of the participants had ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in a report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE described its report published last month as "a transitional and comprehensive review of results".
However, many researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and have pointed to the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
The Lancet Medical Journal's editorial last month put a "remarkably thorough grounding" on the teeth on which PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers have been discussing in the BMJ whether the claims were based on "rock or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have observed: "The basic premise of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness".
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "according to the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the results of the study.
The claim arises from a meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to unify participants' views on the disadvantages of products.
McKeen and Capewell said that the sponsors of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO's previous independent study was financed by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to the sources.
In addition, the CEO expressed his support for BAT's public health activities in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting received funding from an electrical cigarette manufacturer, but the tobacco company Philip Morris International did not receive the funding.
The selection criteria for the panel have not been clarified, but several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes are included, some of whom admit their involvement as industry financiers.
However, the participants are not known for their expertise in the field of smoking control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco correspondent of PHE.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the group's research report shows that there is no conclusive evidence of the harmfulness of the products in relation to a wide range of products and their fulfilment criteria.
However, the PHE report does not mention any connections or deficiencies.
According to the PHE report, there is no evidence so far that electric cigarettes can promote smoking by children or non-smokers.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's director of health and wellness, the allegations have been answered earlier.
Fenton says that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
One in two people who have smoked throughout their lives dies from tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be studied more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform the public of what evidence shows and what it does not show, in particular in situations where the relative dangers of traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80,000 smoking-related deaths each year, and smoking costs public health £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires that we present a clear presentation that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but that the harm they cause is a breakthrough in the harm of traditional tobacco.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Channel 4's Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programmes, including EastEnders and The Voice, and that commercial competitors would give up their right hand on hit shows like soap opera Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to produce programmes that other television stations do not.
He criticised the BBC for presenting programmes likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as competitors' large-scale programmes, such as BBC4.
When BBC CEO Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to expand its partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to partner with the BBC, with no result.
"I disagree with the idea that the BBC should buy formats and broadcast programs that would clearly belong to a competing channel", Johnson told the House Communications Committee, which investigated the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its offerings to at least programmes that are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC is broadcasting The Voice at the best of times because it wants the broadest possible support for the future.
If no other channel cares about the show, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without subsidies", Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders is another, even though it's a production of its own.
A lot of channels would give their right hand to it.
I don't understand how this is serving the broadcasting company's service offerings.
I don't think this would be a loss to the BBC".
Johnson is a series executive who was the head of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, and he believes the BBC is embracing good viewership because the company has ambitious people working for it and because they believe it's the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart talk that the BBC should sell off series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, BBC's niche programmes are shown on BBC4, where viewership is often not measurable, but the programmes serve their purpose. "The BBC can say that in defending its hypocritical missions of £4 billion in public broadcasting payments, it did make special programmes that nobody watched".
"The BBC presents them at times when no one ever sees them".
On public broadcasting, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system as old-fashioned as that which benefits the most.
Everyone, of course, thinks £150 a year is cheap, but people who see it as a big sum, especially if they don't watch the BBC very much".
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also shared his views on the panel on Tuesday, said the BBC should replace its old mission with a new one of "information, education and entertainment".
According to Elstein, the BBC's current offerings barely have 1 percent of the educational programmes on television and 0.1 percent on radio.
In the collaboration, Elstein suggests that the BBC could increase the broadcast of events such as the Proms Festival, which last year only had a fraction of the show. "The BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make the entire supply available online", he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenesis
This video shows how the shuttle shifts when it's targeted by ultrasound.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that allow them to be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttle bugs change direction when they are subjected to ultrasound frequencies above the human ear's auditory area.
Sound waves activate motion cells that have been genetically engineered to have a transport nerve that responds to ultrasound.
More on the subject: Researchers use light to monitor brain activity
According to the researchers, the ants were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new method called dubbed sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells with external stimuli.
Dr. Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could someday replace deep-seated stimulation (DBS).
The shuttle's bodies don't normally respond to ultrasound, but my fellow scientist noticed that the worms do, however, begin to react when they are placed in a liquid that has a microscopic bubble.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that travel into the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect the TRP4 ion channels found in parts of the cell membranes of the worms.
According to an article in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To guide the shuttle jets with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the jets so that some of the nerves that control their movement produced TRP4 ion channels.
When the ultrasound was directed to the modified carpet, the microwave ovens amplified the sound waves and moved to the carpet, which gave the nerve cell a signal.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells with light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brain of the subjects by light fibers, but low frequency ultrasounds can pass through the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that through gene therapy and viral therapy, human nerve cells can be instantly exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical setting in certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.
The researcher suggested that the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices at your doorstep!
The ads are a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Watch the video of Amnesty International's anti-arms rally.
It's a disastrous lethal threat!
You're a fucking fucking fucking foot car!
- What are you doing?
Remote controls that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and graphics clearly reveal that this advertisement for the world's largest fairs is a parody, produced by Amnesty International and intended to highlight the British government's efforts to sell weapons to repressive governments at the Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEI) trade fair, held at ExCel in London's Docklands.
Furthermore: DSEI posts: authoritarian governments reaching London
Bus stops and subway stations are also littered with posters demanding a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you moving on the subway on 15/09/18?" The announcement is reminiscent of the London Underground announcements on its exterior.
"In September, a group of gun dealers will arrive in Docklands, asking customers for help in dismantling the stations".
Three hundred posters have been created by artists whose work was on display at Banksy's Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with a £6 "advertising hacking package" with six-key keys claiming to access about a third of the world's bus stop billboards.
Transport for London is not a laughingstock for propaganda vandalism.
One of the Special Patrol Group's lead-in ads.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Design and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political works to the public outside of galleries.
Artists have found that social impact through art requires bringing art to the real world, and many are moving to work with protest activists.
Another anti-arms billboard welcomes public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours, and was designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the artist have done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, artistic director of the VCCP, noted the absence of trade show advertising and the gap in the ExCeL event calendar, saying, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid".
They tried to make the video more realistic, dimmer, but the bright colors and animation are more eye-catching".
"They have done a wonderful job of helping us to highlight fairs that trade in illegal torture", says Tom Davies, Amnesty's chief executive.
"Now the government must act and ensure that the trafficking of torture equipment is not illegal right in our own country".
However, perhaps the most creative aspect of the exhibition is the exhibition halls themselves at ExCeL, where exhibitors use vibrant circular expressions from their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order from the US military for a "portable AT4CS RS".
The product includes a "special-designed combat rifle that penetrates effectively directly into the target".
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student housing
I moved into a student apartment 11 years ago, and I was innocent at 19, and I still believed in baret and moral relativism, and it's only now that I remember the people's smiles that I irritated, and the countless, long complaints of others.
The most important lessons I can summarize in eight simple rules.
Moving into a home is the most stressful experience and the most shocking.
It's easy to get caught up in the situation: you tell everyone where you are, how you enjoyed your interim year, why you like Corbyn, and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because it's just a baby, a beanbag, I'm in my room".
Take a breath now and then.
And help others to breathe: show interest and ask questions.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even if your lips were on fire and those people were sharing the switches.
Give the others room.
Your own rooms often serve as drinking pools, movie theaters, and common living spaces, but your own room is also a place to dress, starting with your underwear.
More on the subject: Don't even think about combining dating and college
For introverts , college is a tough place .
The home should be a place of quietness, but many residences have a social culture, where people walk from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to restore.
In this environment, it's impossible to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so I can recharge the energy I spent dating you".
Try to see if any of your classmates are tired of social interaction, and perhaps you should not knock on the door and instead send a text message.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my student apartment, there was this guy who thought that an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Make friends with bread.
You start your studies right when baking is in, so if you're baking brownies and knocking on someone's door, you don't look like a 50s, a little weird case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I tell you something personal".
I mean, homemade candy is a great way to make new friends.
Your classmates need to talk to you, and a tasty surprise can leave a positive impression of you.
Of course, this requires you to have reasonable breadcrumbing skills.
If you serve unfortunate cooks who are full of flour, sugar, and fat, others will likely pretend to be asleep when you knock on their door.
Food digestion is also a common problem in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you drop a piece of tea from another chicken's milk?
Always check with the milkman.
You'll probably get permission, even if the milk quote is a little too much for the owner of the can.
I understand how annoying it is when someone tells you something, but try to handle it as adultly as possible, unlike my own classmate who laundered his milk as punishment for milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don't whine when others try to sleep or get a little sleepy.
Not only is it polite, but it's also worth remembering that each person digging a hole...
In my own apartment, a girl asked the next room resident to lower the music because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had a test in the morning.
The neighbor just added a little more volume.
When I finally got quiet in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, went to the exam for three hours, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you thought at first that your schoolmate was going to be your future husband, started dating, broke up, and had to see him every day, and lost the right to meet your mutual friends to him?
The heart wants what it wants, but if the student is not the only one, try to control it.
If you notice in a moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room with no door locked, the boundary between trickery and bullying is more perplexing than you might think.
A good joke is fun, but one that comes back to life in a moment.
Hiding something can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be mixed with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door to the other room and drop the keys in a water bottle that you put in the freezer, but don't attach anyone's stuff to the ceiling with blue a couple more times.
A racist attack on the home of foreign students in Kiteel - a house designed as a reception center was robbed in Salo
A racist attack on the home of foreign students was carried out on Saturday morning in Kite, North Kerala.
Contrary to what police had previously said, these are not the dormitories of minors seeking asylum but rather dormitories for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kitti Evangelisk National University.
The windows and walls of the public university dormitories were painted with racist markings, such as punches, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the dormitories, eastern Finnish police said.
According to Luukkainen, a responsible teacher in the youth social security training program at the National University of Georgia, an estimated ten people were in the building at the time of the attack.
"If it was a weekend and adults were free to move around, some might be elsewhere", says Luccainen.
The public school has 12 people from different nationalities.
They are already students in Finland for some time and newly arrived minors seeking asylum.
Everyone in this messed up building has a "A" status.
Some are in adult primary school, some are in vocational courses and some are studying Finnish", says Luukkainen.
A-status is a permanent residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in eastern Finland are investigating the attack as a result of damage and a breach of domestic law.
Luukkainen said that a press conference was held for the students on Monday, with the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for twelve years, and this is the first time something like this has happened", says Luccainen.
According to Luukkain, the mess has already been cleared from the walls.
The suspects involved at least three men who were travelling in a white passenger car.
I think this is a weekend headline for the young man, when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that", says Luke.
Also in Salò, there is a poisoned hospital with a reception center.
The case happened last week.
MTV reported the incident on their website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was painted with a stick and the words "You are not welcome" were written in English.
The police have a criminal complaint.
Correction of the incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y-train to the Cattle... passengers on their knees, "really idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor's Cattle Station will stop running in March.
The news annoyed the passengers who boarded the train's opening night shift at the Helsinki main railway station.
"The downpour is particularly striking for the blessed", said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident of the municipality.
It's a very stupid country, because the population is growing all the time and those who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on the video interview with HSTV that he's coming to the capital on a tractor.
There are also train changes in other parts of the New World.
The H and R trains running on the line shall be combined into a new R line.
The station of Purola in Lake Erie and the station of Nuppulinna in Tuusulas will be decommissioned.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published on Tuesday information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase rail transport during the next contract period.
The contract period changes year-over-year and there are cancellation routes across the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee at a later date.
The Sicilian Bengtström considers the state railway system to be a short-sighted activity.
We're going to make the same mistakes we've made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then you'll have regrets.
The Y-train is also used by people other than the Raziporis and the Besionians because it is fast and passes several stations.
Anina Pöyryä, from Espoo, was a train wreck that devastated the lives of those who traveled beyond the city.
"It's especially sad for those who have to re-planning their journey", he said, hurting the Y-train.
I'm gonna give you a little relief.
A new train is likely to arrive on the coastline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Regional Transport Area (HSL), which will take you to Kirkkonum.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. for the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now looking into the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices", said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train about a million a year, certainly much more than that.
The R line coming to the edge of the bridge will miss two stations.
Instead, in the Solitaire and Sauna Lounges, the number of train rides will double.
The entire country has 28 small stations and numerous routes.
The Ministry will no longer buy rail services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The route from Piecieciec to Joensuu is shortened to Piecieciec Theft.
The train rides are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
The Commission has already decided to extend the period of validity of the measures to be taken to ensure that the measures taken are not distorted.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book The Currentness of Capital: "It Is Worth Getting to Know Marx"
The global economic crisis has brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his 1867-1894 masterpiece Capital to the surface, writes Yrjö Hakanen, former chairman of the SKP, in his book The Current of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He is taken more seriously now than he has been in a long time", Hakanen writes in his opening remarks.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and increasing penetration of all spheres of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The author's list of books based on the Capital seminars organised by Hake is also provided by Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected economist at Aalto University.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is timely "now and forever".
But the former director of the Institute for Life Research and the Commission for Life Research is not a Marxist, is he?
- No, not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a modern economist but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are diverse and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary scholar.
"The common perception is that the history of the religion tells us about the wrong opinions of the dead men", begins Korkman.
It is true that Marx's predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the Industrial Revolution, he drew conclusions that went too far from the beginnings of capitalism, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical stance.
"What was most relevant about Marx was that he asked good questions", he says.
Now we're going to discuss topics of interest to Marx, like wealth distribution.
"Marx may be an inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, a world that is changing as a result of a technological revolution", analyzed Korkman.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not a Marxist help.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
But Korkman thinks it's worth getting to know Marx.
"In the 1970s, Marx could not read", says Korkman.
"The Maoists, the Trotskyists and the other factions all hated capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and even Marx can be approached without the ideological and political pressure of the years ahead.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with the world of Marx's thought - like all other classics", says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan civil war, AFP news agency reports.
The UN report on the civil war of 1983-09 came out Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebel groups known as the Tamil militiamen of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died in the Sri Lankan civil war.
There's no exact number of victims.
The UN report calls for a thorough investigation into the major military offensive in the final months of the long war in 2009, in particular.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely to be men as women.
The rebels have been charged with the forced entry of children and young people into the fighting.
Both sides have been charged with murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself but will not allow the establishment of the UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo-test was a social media experiment.
In the fall school year, there was a long foreign language shift on Wednesday, mostly English.
He tested his English skills on over 16,000 students.
He could have written the test stuff on social media.
Based on personal experience, we had to consider whether social media made us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an article of 150 to 250 words in English could be pointed to the person holding the magazine's advisory board.
The title was "Dear Agony Aunt".
Agony Aunt is in charge of Lelia's Finnish restroom.
He had to ask for advice on how parents should view matters from the perspective of young ones.
There were four subjects in total, one of which was to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them all", Mia Lybeck, an English teacher at Porvoo Swedish High School, said of the third subject.
The third item was merely a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
And Lybeck said the fourth was a nice one.
It was supposed to be a fireworks discourse about why companies should hire young people.
"At least our school has been practicing speech writing", says Lybeck, and he considers the whole experiment "normal".
The Finnish - or Swedish - English test was able to answer questions about texts that could help, for example, adapting the summer campaign to climate change and processing large volumes of data.
On Wednesday, some long-form Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn workshops continue on Friday, when the second national, Swedish or Finnish, is in session.
The examination is normally held in high schools, so it's not affected by the employees' expressions of mind.
The Higher Education Statistics Board urges the students to find the right connections in time to qualify for the test.
Additional time may be granted if it can be shown that the delay was not due to negligence.
In Oulu, the gun trade was looted with the threat of
Oulu was robbed Wednesday morning of a store in the Cello neighborhood.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothes and a face-covering command post.
He's a normal-looking man, about 30.
Police said the man threatened the staff with a handgun and was able to seize a small amount of money.
We're investigating a robbery that's gross.
Police are preparing for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki with supporting parties from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's decision to cut the city will be blocked in the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary data, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK associations will meet at 11:00 a.m. at the Railway Centre.
Police are also believed to be involved in the protest.
On the other hand, the task of the police on duty is not only to carry out the alert and other police functions, but also to ensure the flow of the giant's message.
The roads leading to the railway station will be closed to motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9:30 to 14:00.
We're only gonna let emergency vehicles into the area.
Traffic in the direction of Hakaneem will be cut off at the Kaisaniem traffic circle, westward from Mannerheim Field.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Lieutenant Seppo Kujala?
At least for now, it seems like enough.
I'm not taking a stand on police work-related matters.
According to Kujalan, support groups from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki to protest.
The police are not giving us exact numbers.
"There is some progress coming, but we usually do it on our own", says Kujala.
Police are urging you to avoid private vehicles in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam will extend from the Hakaneem level to the core.
Traffic is expected to be stable from dawn to dusk.
Along with the other Finnish protesters, many buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed to go to the railway yard.
The buses are basically a long way off.
The final step is to walk to the protest site", Kujala says.
The airspace will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police standpoint, there's a positive side to this.
The problem of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large gatherings, is now partly solved.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policies may be arriving in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the protest to flow quietly.
The people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful people", Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also being held throughout Finland on Friday.
Friday's mental expression is exceptional in many ways. Remember those strikes and mental expressions?
The large demonstration organized by trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not much comparison in Finnish political history", says Martti Siiseninen, professor emeritus of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
No wonder the Ay movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, says Siysienne.
The far-right government has attacked the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's strict grip on contract law is lacking.
There are many features to the fact that the ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
And the ay movement has a mirror-watching spot.
For example, the need for mirrors is due to the fact that the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's expressions of mind.
What is new is the sharp division that the expression of opinion creates among the group that the Ay movement would like to participate in the protest.
The unemployed from all over Finland showed their support in the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If you look for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be the massive demonstration of unemployment, organized in 1993 by Murrostorstai, says Siiseninen.
The Murrostorst, organized in the middle of the deepest depression, gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The First Ahon (Central) Government is moving from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage-earners' organizations had never been worse than under the Ahon bourgeois government.
Now, the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than they were in Murrostorst.
Besides, there is now the most bourgeois government in Finland ever, Siysienne says.
The current coalition is still interesting in that it is so strictly right-wing, despite the comments of fundamentalists.
In the early days, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to arrive on Friday.
The expression of opinion will also stop public transport and possibly close day care homes and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive the undivided support of the employees, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been organized in Helsinki every year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Ay movement's protests in Finland have been relatively peaceful, although the practices have intensified in recent years.
Traditionally, in Finland, protests are avoided by conflict, and we obey the law.
The protesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Siisena says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs, and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The fire strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also apparent strikes by pilots and flight attendants.
Remember these strikes and protests?
1970s metal and electrical alloys
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the 1971 metal strike and the 1977 power and electricity strike.
The strike was attended by 70,000 metalworkers.
The strike was suspended on the recommendation of the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
The metal guys got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, a power outage lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
The first of these was the first of the three.
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom were unemployed, gathered in the House to express their views on work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998.
The fire strike was one of the shortest, if not the longest, national strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in the egg rain in 1994 when farmers protested against the EU.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops", was one of the slogans.
The farmers of Espalle were snowing tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also urged farmers to protest and burn flour pellets in front of the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marred by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and gang-rap the nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass exchanges has accelerated the negotiations to a final result.
Doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced to leave", was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The five-month strike by local health centres and hospital doctors sparked a lively debate about the risks to patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Some 5,000 students marched for scholarships from the Senate building in Helsinki to the House of Representatives in 2013.
Central Crime Police are investigating the background of a Finnish refugee camp for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in investigating the background of a refugee camp registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly en route to Finland.
Everyone on the cold-blooded ride was fine.
We've had a briefing with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main investigation are at the scene in Austria, says the Central Crime Police Chief Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, the fate of other refugees in Austria who travelled in lorries was more tragic.
All 71 passengers on board died of suffocation.
According to the first Austrian police officer, who reported the cooperation, the truck belongs to a Finnish joint stock company.
The company operates restaurants and its CEO is a foreigner, aged about 40.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
Captain, former drug lord, and rebellious businessman, who beat up refugees.
A drunken smuggler king, a violent Russian, a stylish missionary and a self-described good-natured cab driver.
For example, such people are trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, who work at Trenton University, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Agency is coming out in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the dangers of human trafficking, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of the business.
HS is introducing five of them.
I 'll beat their asses right off .
The Kerkenna Islands off the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians go there for summer vacations.
The islands are also well suited for smuggling, since the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometers away.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives the Emir, a chained burning captain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fisherman is more profitable at transporting people.
The Emir has done it hundreds of times with his blue, 10-meter wooden boat.
If the boat is fully enclosed, it can hold 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, things calmed down until the refugee crisis began again.
Customers arrive from the mainland in small groups on the Kerkenna Islands.
The Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is delivered in such a way that the customers are kept alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if the client runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight, the shortest we've ever been.
The first night we drive off the islands, then we stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves up to 20 meters high, the passengers cry and vomit.
The human nakedness at the destination has been stripped in half an hour and Emir is leaving for his return journey.
The Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least claims to be beating up the hangers to death.
He tells the book that when the police caught up with him once, he threw all his passengers over the deck and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one and threw them across the bar", Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers are coming from the southern Sahara.
He says his fellow citizens must be abusing him for this.
I'll just knock their heads off.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cabbie .
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogova, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter motor is dragging its last, and by the way, it's had its best days.
But what matters most to Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which mainly allows families to leave.
In the forests surrounding the city, men traveling without their families are housed in tents, huts, and abandoned cars, which everyone has now found or built.
The forest also includes families who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some of them are also housed in private residences, but it's a public secret.
Among the forest people, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and week-long walks in rough terrain, often mountainous and dark.
When they finally arrive in Bogova region, the hub of a major human trafficking, people are dying tired.
The Goran passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough", Goran compliments.
He says Africans are trying to get away with it.
That's not what Goran likes.
A foolish fool goes all the way.
First, they agree on a price of, say, 300 euros, then they cut it down to 200 and finally they offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice, good-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people", she says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a trip to the Hungarian border.
It's a three hundred kilometers, mostly comfortable highways.
I hear your colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran makes about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometers closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care. He knows the roads and the paths, and he takes his passengers a mile across the border.
Then he points his clients in the right direction and he's gonna throw it away.
The Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese is called Missionary, not just a nickname.
He does have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where many Congolese refugees attend, and a small center that helps Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business that transports people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a job of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the white-collared rubber band looks elegantly under the low waistline of her hips.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary is not preaching, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five telephone numbers of the Broadcasting Mission.
He advises that you arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money quietly, and mingle with traders crossing the border.
To obtain asylum seekers or refugees, the Ugandan authorities must inform them that they are from war zones, such as North Kivu, and that they have fled violence in their homes.
Often, that's true, but if it isn't, the Missionary will provide the client with a new identity.
The old ID will be destroyed and replaced with a new one.
That's where the contacts of the missionary in the Ugandan police will help.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum process, to NGOs, and finally to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy, having come to Uganda as a refugee himself.
He charges a fee of about EUR 100 for each step: submitting an application to the Ugandan police, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation, about EUR 150, and moving to a European country, for example, for EUR 4 500 to 7 000.
Folies and ice cream
Tom is a bootlegger, a former drug trafficker.
A 40-year-old Irishman lives on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks en route to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they're in the human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the cabbie picked up their customers, usually two or three people, from somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving down the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be jailed for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highways to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing down the canal to Brittany.
Tom chooses the right truck, makes sure it's heading to England, not Holland, and cuts through the safety barrier.
It's a quiet thing to do, or the driver wakes up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the deal is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom turns his client into an aluminum foil, the same one that is wrapped around a toast or a oven pan in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police from detecting the hologram of the hologram.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping he doesn't drive a sudden greasepaint, at least not until Britain.
The King of Secretaries
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human traffickers.
The talented Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, who rules the sea route from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands money when he gets there.
One new method is luxury boat fraud: Turkish ports are rented as a pleasure cruise to take American or European families on comfortable, few-day tourist trips.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported first from Istanbul to a port and then by sea to Europe for a fee of EUR 5,000 to 7,000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until they are ready to leave.
People are locked up in minibuses and driven to shore.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
Once we've given it, we'll have to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under the cover for the entire journey.
The Navy can only observe the depth of the ship, since no other signs of a crowd are visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the fewer passengers who vomit and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive about EUR 53,000 for one luxury boat trip after the costs.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other smaller agents to handle the work for him.
In the summer, at least hundreds of transportation are arranged and Küçük makes millions.
He estimates he's buying through undercover companies land, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he's apparently gone missing.
Amendment of 16 September 2015 at 3:10 pm: Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next week.
An American Olympic runner tells of his illness and prostitution in his book
A new book by three-time Olympic 1500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book, Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published snippets of the book Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in his best form and ran the race for second best time.
But in the final, she panicked.
He rushed to the top right away and defended his lead in the race.
But 150 meters before the painting, his powers were over.
He crashed onto the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
Her brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressures to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was attracted to the idea of making money by having sex with strangers.
She also over-talked her husband to accept her actions.
The Favor Hamilton fee was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he craved the same adrenaline rushes he had when competing in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton learned that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed at the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world record holder in the 1500 meters with a time of 3.57.40, but finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
World champion cheered when the League disciplined Norwegian skiers, "Right-tailed"
Norway's ski king, Petter Northug, has crossed the line of fitness, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been turning their sports contract down, as they did last summer and autumn.
While the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than any other athlete, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation has decided to withdraw from the World Cup next season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union had the ski club.
"Thank you for your support", Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsorship of the union", he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northugh is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be a part of the national team for the season so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that would also look after future generations and not allow one athlete to stand alone.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union had granted Northug economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he's the best.
Northug issued his own statement on Tuesday, saying he wanted to wear Norwegian at the next World Cup, as well as the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen has won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, including two golds.
He was on the team that won the gold medal last winter at Falun.
The Day of the Translators is also celebrated in the North
On 25 September, the festival will be held in restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Shrimp's Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of knowledge in the food industry and to lower the barrier to going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of shielding as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is worth recalling that not all high-end restaurants are concentrated in the capital, but that top restaurants, which are inspected and rated by an impartial operator, are found throughout Finland.
The international attention it receives is a testament to the importance of the event as part of raising awareness of the event's competitors and the organisation.
In the Nordic countries, the day is organized at the Vaasa restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarelliks.
The cooking is taking place at the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
The decision was made to make it one of the most important international events of the Organization, held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has decided to grant the Council a special opinion on the draft directive.
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the former Kauhava barracks now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a crisis-critical infrastructure which is permanently in use by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finnish Erillisnetkot Oy.
According to Kauhajoki, the private individual believes that the location of a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
The complainant said the defence forces may have interests in the former air force school and its airport, the impact of which has not yet been explored in the preparation of the reception centre.
The Commission notes that the airport operator's activities in the airport are not related to the airport's activities.
The matter was discussed with Minister of Defence, Mr Jussi Niinistö (PS) and Minister of Defence, Mr Arto Rady.
The individual states to the legal counsel that the complaint is not a matter of a principle opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former equipment area is wrong.
The terrible city council was dealing with the reception center issue last Monday.
True: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö said in a statement to reporters after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniem.
The President said that concern about the management of the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He believes that the political and political parties in Finland can discuss the most fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially at a time when we face great challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, could thus also have an impact on Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a new directive.
If that develops in a positive direction, i.e. if the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the continued tension in the Baltic Sea.
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the draft budget.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, and you'll be closed for a couple of hours.
One flight is already cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on the Finnair website.
Finavia reports that the aim is to operate airports with a commander-in-chief's force during the work stoppage.
However, traffic and delays are expected at security inspections and other service points.
The demonstration is closing down the streets of central Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say the road to the railway station will be closed to vehicles at approximately 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The Mannerheim mission will not allow cars to enter the mine, post and work bays towards the railway station.
From Union Road Hakaniem traffic shall be diverted to Union Road at the Kaisaniem traffic circle.
Police say the shutdown time depends on the number of protesters.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and railroad buses all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will participate in a demonstration on Friday morning from morning traffic to night traffic.
The union of radio and subway personnel told STT about this tonight.
Most of the Alkoho closes for two hours, including post offices closed.
Friday's mood swings are also causing disruption to Post's services.
Significant delays are expected, including for the distribution of daily mail.
Most of the mail service points are closed.
Blood shipments of the Finnish Red Cross are being handled despite the strike.
The aim is to handle food shipments, hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
The information on the services can be obtained from the Post's website.
Most Finnish Alkohouses close their doors for two hours on Fridays.
The service industry union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also called on day-to-day merchants to participate in the expression of opinion of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko inform Helsingin Sanom that the stores will be kept open by the superintendent if necessary.
Kesko said there was no information yet on the possible closure of individual stores.
The Helsinki daycare centre is partially closed
The Helsinki daycare centre is not fully functioning on Friday, the Helsinki Early Education Agency reports.
The main reasons for this are that the daycare is concentrated on certain day schools, and that club activities are not organised in day schools and playgrounds.
Day care centres and groups of children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities for children with developmental disabilities and autistic children are normally organised.
The Early Childhood Education Agency will be announcing further changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: The spider takes a big risk
According to Sibila, communication requires a variety of channels, and the prime minister's television and radio speeches are one of the channels.
This is the kind of direct communication we will need in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
Mr Sipil was not yet prepared to assess how often the prime minister's television and radio speeches are repeated.
According to Sipela, the speeches may not always be transmitted through the Yle channels in the future.
If any other channels sign up, we'll see.
Now, this channel is used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sibila, the Finnish economy is in such serious condition that it requires a television and radio address to the citizens.
This whole issue is quite complex and requires a longer reasoning.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipil said.
The talk will be broadcast at 9.05pm and 21.20pm on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at the Yle Arena.
The Apple is taking a big risk
A media analyst hopes that Sipila's television speech will not tell of a more general government inward turn.
Is there an attempt to take the right to define public debate more strictly into their own hands and to refuse to question the settings of public debate?
I am reminded of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of the democratic debate and the public, I hope these things are not connected.
I'm sorry to hear that the commercial media has been upset by Sipila's announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision makers are not a matter of communication in a democracy.
The role of the media is to make sure that politicians' agendas are not taken for granted.
Koivus says that the TV talk is a big risk for Sipila.
The speaker should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations.
Is there anything more to offer today than what we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in a different word, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only one more of the same old one in the permit, one must wonder why such a big move was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
One takes the risk in the sense that it is not a particular situation but a routine conversation among others.
The danger is that the YLE will be labeled as a message by politicians or parliament and the government, which is certainly not in YLE's interests or general line.
A smart bet from a peach
In the next speech, the prime minister's omission is also important, the media analyst stresses.
"Tonight, we need to look closely at what Sipila is missing and what he is not", says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jvaskyla.
I heard that the TV talk is a clever appeal from Sipila, because this is how he gets to present his own views without any noise.
This will give a broad audience a message without a journalist filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The spider is going to go beyond the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media may misinterpret the speech because it will not allow accurate questions to be asked.
I heard it was very important how Silvia was on TV, how she was sweating, how her hands were shaking.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can play it right, it can work.
It's different than when the government announces something, because here, it's like a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what (U.S. President Barack) Obama and his associates do regularly.
Very exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be very exceptional.
He said that the Prime Minister has not spoken directly to the people in decades.
"Exceptional times require exceptional means", says Railo.
The researcher estimates that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail ahead.
The payroll organizations are holding a protest and strike on Friday against the government's actions.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter that Sipila could make his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow for discussion.
The SDP chairman, Antti Rinne (S), announced his challenge to the dialogue with Mr Sipila.
This is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy who was on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Finnish police department also confirmed the incident to the Evening Post.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later that evening, he was never contacted again.
Dad's thanking everyone who helped me find him.
Thank you for all the ten contacts and observations you've made during these hours.
The update was split closer to 15,000 times , which is an incredible balance in such a short time .
Finnish UFC star disappointed in youth violence:
Kurdish-born freelancer Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook appealing especially to immigrant-born youth.
Makwan Amirkhani was making a powerful speech against the street fighting of young people.
Born in Iran and brought to Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC freestyle series so far.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
There's been a video uploaded to the account showing young people fighting in the most violent way.
My wife says she's disappointed in the youngsters' wildness.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You guys kick people down, sit on each other and hit them with your eyes open, without even thinking about the consequences of making these videos, Amirkhani said.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people in the videos are immigrant-oriented.
According to Jarmo Heinosen, police commissioner in Helsinki, the video of the fight has been uploaded to social media by immigrants and young people from Kantan Finland.
It's called fighting on the street.
You are making life more difficult than many other immigrants here in Finland, says the turquoise Amirkhani.
Amirkhani reminds you that there are websites in Finland that look for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite a lot of rough stuff.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any more.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be a long time guests here.
That's a little different way of saying thank you for being here, says Amirkhani.
My office urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get the target of some kind of racism, you might blame yourself.
Now, you guys think twice before you go into something like that.
My Amirkhani says that violent activity contributes to racism.
You're making a lot of hate in the dark, which I don't like.
You're going through a rough patch anyway, and that spending won't make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges to take its position in the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employer organisation was considering its position on the alternative savings scheme proposed by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The Centre for Personnel Management (STTK) said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity cut demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
The President of the ACA, Sture Fjäder, believes that the Board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind it.
However, this would require the largest employer organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented briefly on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK working committee will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is seeking solutions to 'open up the labour market' and that contracts signed by active parties are needed to replace mandatory laws.
Lyly points out that the proposal for a collective bargaining agreement by the government of Prime Minister Sipila was not appropriate for SAK.
Sibiu has previously suspended negotiations on the joint venture agreement when SAK failed to commit to the 5% productivity allocation target.
Comment: The big-minded demonstration threatens to go viral. "I feel a little weird about punching".
I feel a little weird about fighting a fight if you already have a paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies in the pay camps from the edge to the bottom.
Is it to call a government shutdown or do we have to agree?
On Monday, the SAK's leaders unleashed a holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The fear would spread to the wild.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or day care facilities will be closed completely.
On Wednesday, the President of the Centre for Personnel, STTK, Antti Palola (sd), made a pleasant appearance.
He said he had contacted the government and had prepared an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity rate, which Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) demanded.
The President of the ACA, Sture Fjäder (co-founder), hastened to announce immediately that his paperwork had been completed.
The SAK office didn't hear from the yard at first.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is having a hard time agreeing with the union leaders who just on Monday ordered a ceasefire on Friday.
However, Lyly finally stated that the SAK Working Committee will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to 'open up the labour market'.
In order to create a common employee picture, the SAK should be inclined to adopt a productivity target of 5%.
No wonder the Palladian STTK has good relations with the Sibilla government.
Palla's right-hand man, the STTK's social impact director, Jukka Ihanus, previously served as special assistant to the central government prime ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniem.
Mr Palola also described the government's ability to improve its skills as a whole.
It is a coincidence that the outcome of the Palola took a little cleaning away from the Finnish stand-up comedians, whose bowling figures are the AKT's Marko Piirainen (sd).
I feel a little weird about fighting a fight when you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m. Added information about Lyla's comments.
Russia accused Finland of being a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian Duma chairman Sergei Naryshkin has criticized the Helsinki Conference of the European Commission.
The Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is a better host of the EEC than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, the monthly session of the Etyji Parliamentary Assembly has begun, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebration.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians like Naryshkin who were on the EU's ban list to attend the meeting - a fact the President managed to remind reporters about.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin pressed, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin was criticized for his entry into the United States, where he was also banned.
Sanctions are political suicide in the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation to Mongolia was not successful, so Naryshkin continued to praise Finland and thank Mongolia for its "exceptional organization".
I am sure that the General Assembly will proceed with constructive and positive results, unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva (co) who is leading the meeting in Ulan Bator and has already discussed the matter with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
The lock is facing a real playoff kick: "Paints tight".
Tappara and Luke are going to continue the Bull Days in the Hakeam Forest today, with both on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicted that today in the Hakam Forest, there will be no real painting party.
Tappara was in Copiah yesterday, picking up a 3-to-2 win over Kalpa.
The rise was manly, because last season's silver team was at its worst of two points.
Tuesday was the closing day.
The Blues, who started the Rafale game with a sneak peek, had a round zero point, and a losing streak of 2-3.
A tough game, tight paints, if anyone plays the same game as last year, Lock Attacker Janne Lahti predicted settings on the sidelines.
The Matarras have become a playoff nightmare for the Rumaans.
Tappara has been in the middle of the final two seasons of the season.
Both times, the final seven games are required.
Last season, the Lock took the series to a close in the fourth game, but Tappara went up and past the next three.
The group composition has not changed significantly except for the goalkeepers.
The two cash registers who were rejected yesterday will be paid a cheat today.
With the Tappara goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Bear, and between the lock-up tiles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsky.
The scene: A terrible play in progress
Sports director Toivola wrote the script for the sequel, which is not compatible with the Iron Ball, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the script for Rocky, which he himself starred in.
The recorder made a sensational gesture to the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
Rocky was very well liked, even though he lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote the script for the restless ashtray story of Pori.
An unnamed and unstable stabbed man went to the 2006 SM finals to everyone's surprise.
The team was full of unnamed but stubborn underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Porin Matt and Pele from Peltos.
In the knockout games, players would color their heads red and cut their iroses.
I was hoping for a blonde.
The great TV reporter JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The donkey took the silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that the innovation of this season is working the same way it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a donkey sports manager has built a potato farm for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting guys in the backyard like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The credit of Masi Marjam, Mikko Viitas, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparise is somewhere other than in the game of hockey.
Hope has forgotten that Rocky VI is about the lead role of the Iron Curtain.
Carrie Stone has been crowned Iron Man Sean Connery.
Iron Curtain is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original 1976 production of Toivola's Rocky.
There's nothing in the train except Rocky's nickname.
The philosophy of the game is not to run and play.
He appreciates hardball, but it's different to play hardball than a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Eagles beat Tappara's River from the head to the head.
He got two minutes and 10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Curtain put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I don't approve of that game, and it's not part of the game of ace, because the hot-tempered Iron Man got angry after the game against the People of the Century.
The team this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops, and scouts.
There's practically no key players in the best gaming age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the talent.
How much influence have you been able to have on player acquisitions, Iron Curtain?
The recent events have affected purchases and unfortunately the market situation was rather tight, said Rautakallio diplomatically.
It's under the surface.
The 1953 model year, the Iron Curtain, is known to be interested in moving to Toivola for a sports holiday.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The score for the three league games of the season is equal to the number of losses by a score of 1-6.
I don't think it would have been worthwhile for Desola to write the sequel.
Olga Temonen is playing Sipe Santapuk's mother.
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka when he was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is performing for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yeah, I'm gonna be in the movie as the mother of my husband's friend.
It's kind of crazy, but the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to former Apuliana bassist and director Tuukka Temes since 2008.
The couple have worked together a lot in the past, but now Olga is acting for the first time under the direction of Tuuk.
The role of Olga in the movie You Made Us Beautiful, which tells the story of the early years of Apulan, is that of the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Circa.
The circus is thumping and supporting its son, even though his father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get acquainted with my real role of the circus, the easier it feels to play the part.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuck for trusting me to do the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have grown very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, and communicated.
The circus has been a big help.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
And fortunately, the circus also understands that drama is drama and that the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only band in Heinola who blindly believed that Aulanna would become Finland's biggest band.
The '90s were a lot of lazy, and it was really miserable.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirca had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard much about Tuuka's youth before the film was made.
But the stories of the parents have been a little different from time to time.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know what you're talking about?
Olga reveals that her own youth was quite different from that of the notorious skater, Tuuk, of Heinolan.
Olga was a simple, kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie "The Twilight".
At best, she could have secretly been in love.
According to Olga, he's worked so much with Tuuka in the last 10 years that he's not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always been super-good.
Now the entire production team is going to film for a month in Heinola.
Of course, the couple living in Istria often plans to drive home for their young children, often overnight, since the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole of Heinolan for a month.
They've been very warm to us, asking just which streets and when to clear.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive Finnish drama film ever made
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Moorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
The filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola is set to begin filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is set to become the most expensive Finnish drama film of all time with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive Finnish film was Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation is also set to rise above Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over €100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukoma, will begin filming in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and will run for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The budget's not scary.
I've been sick and tired!
I'm so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there's no fear in your ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to get this movie out there for the public to see", he tells Evening Post.
The original budget for the film was $8 million to $8 million, but as the script progressed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's also a big store.
But the film could get 100 million dollars because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything is so tightly twisted that there's not a single loose one.
Film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond loan on Wednesday, paying an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final rate shall be determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
The company will pay back the loan in two years' time.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
A bunch or a cool one?
Big logos are back on shirts.
The trendsetter's fronts have recently been decorated with large logos.
A while back, a fashion-savvy dresser avoided the big, clear logos like Crocs and Consanas.
Advertising a pair of shoes or a t-shirt was seen as a bit of a joke.
But times change.
Sport has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, well-known sports brands like Adidas and Nike, rising to the brink of coolness.
And as so often as ever, the funny and trendy boundary is a daunting one: if something is already a good thing, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, a trendsetter's surprise by choosing the most boring basic clothes as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Instead of the gray basic college, we're going to put on the webbed buried at the bottom of the cupboard, with the manufacturer's logo on it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' recognizable track and field teams, favorite team jerseys, and New York Yankees tickets have also made a comeback.
The Calvin Klein logo, the one with the first-hand look on the edge of the fork, is a cool detail.
It seems that the trend is shifting from sports to luxury brands.
For example, the Versace jacket brush is a clear indication of what a signature dress is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dressing?
The Russian politician published evidence that I was not trapped in a tank trap for hours!
The Commission also concluded that the Russian Arms Expo 2015 was a special event in Nizhni Tagil.
In recent days, Russian media have been making colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Affairs had to remove the large Zotov from the tank shell for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page showing him peering through the hull of an armored vehicle in a rather good mood and at least not from the pictures of any trapped or angry.
It's all bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the tank. It was a BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm a former soldier myself, a lieutenant colonel, I've served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around, and came out peacefully, Zotov told Komosomolska Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov told the Russian army's TV channel that he was fascinated by the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, and I loved our technology.
And I came out through the back of the car, he said.
I've been to every tank.
And at the next exhibition, I will definitely visit every tank and every tank, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One idiot wrote it, and everyone else did it.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall and short, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere happened", he told Russian sluzhba novotei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged trapped have been published, despite the fact that a total of 50,000 people attended the exhibition over the course of a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's trappedness was initially reported on a Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told by his rims of a tank shaft as he tried to get out and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he did not get off the surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organizers shared their own views on the event.
Everybody's just used to the fact that soldiers jump out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he never sat there for five hours", said Alexander Pisarevsky, the exhibition coordinator, to Bloknot.
Here's a favorite of the decorating bloggers.
The 1962 pencil by architects Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks as if it were designed today.
A lunar-colored steel shell is like a work of art, and that's what it was in the beginning.
Architects are known for their long-standing pencil shape and their mathematical precision.
It was initially only presented to the gentlemen's dignified dinner guests.
The cubes are made by the family-owned By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of the famous brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.
The cup is black and white, and nickel and copper are available.
The brush is up-to-date right now and is suitable for a wide variety of homes.
It's been a favorite of the decorating bloggers lately.

What about schools and day care?
Police and fire?
The food stalls, the Alkot and the mail car, not to mention the factories and the harbor?
The details of the strike information may be changed by Friday.
The Evening News website will keep you updated.
The fox is shooting at the Blues for the opening win of the season.
In the first two games, the Blues, who were outscored by their opponents, took their season opener by defeating the Lock.
The winner shot Ville Korhonen with only a minute left to play.

You know a lot about where you're going and who you want to spend your time with.
You don't want to stay in your seat. You want to move on.
You're putting so much emphasis on something about yourself that someone starts talking to you about it.
This conversation is not meant to end.
It shows how interesting you are.
A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine in Finland, owned by the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle.
The refined process water from the gold mine has leaked out of the so-called "rich-pools" into the well.
The company said that measures to rectify the leak have been initiated.
The pool has a neutral enrichment area and purified process water.
In general, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or is discharged into the environment through a surface treatment area as authorised.
The estimated flow was about 300 cubic metres per hour when detected.
The company said the quality of the leakage water meets the current licensing requirements.
Nothing else was leaking into the environment.
The leak was detected during a check-up on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the water supply structures has been observed.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and rectify the situation.
The mine employs about 600 permanent workers.
Danish banker: IMF warns against cutting too much
The IMF's report on the financial situation in Finland, published today by the International Monetary Fund, largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation encouraged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
The IMF believes that reducing overtime and paid vacations would support Finland's competitiveness.
The whole contract system and the unemployment insurance system would need to be reformed.
According to Danske Bank chief economist Pasi Kuoppamaen, the structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of message of sympathy for government action, but on the other hand there is also a warning about what should not be cut too much.
This is the case for infrastructure investments, Mr Kooppamäki told the Economic Report.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts that Finland will grow by 0.4% this year, and will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske predicted that growth would remain zero this year in its new relationship forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest observations.
This morning, the Statistical Office reported that the total production was at a low growth rate in the summer, says Kooppamäki.
The weakening of industry confidence or other so-called softer measures have received less attention.
However, the differences are only a few percentage decimal places.
Nintendo, recovering from death, has appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata was the head of Nintendo from 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching the successful Wii console.
The 65-year-old Kimishima's choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were being raised as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to bring Nintendo to mobile games in a big way, but not to eat the company's bread on traditional gaming consoles.
More and more asylum seekers are arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency admitted that up to hundreds of children who have arrived in Sweden disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year, according to the SVT and Dagens Nyheter websites.
The inspector general of the Immigration Agency, Juha Kannelmaa, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is Finland in the same situation?
How many asylum seekers disappear "underground" per year? - In Finland, a total of 156 asylum seekers who arrived alone in 2013 were made.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 such applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa said.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is established at the hearing that the applicant is already registered in another Dublin Regulation country and may have been declared an adult there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attracted to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
A similar proportion of the missing are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, out of which 134 applications were decided to be disqualified because the applicant had likely moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past year, he says.
Is the number growing?
By September 6, this year, we have received a total of 586 single-entry asylum applications from minors.
The overall statistics on missing asylum seekers are not yet available, but the number of asylum seekers is known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have been convicted?
Is it also going to "black labor markets"?
The Commission has not yet decided whether to approve the decision.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Soc) has expressed concern about the growing number of unregistered country seekers.
He's taken action on the case.
At the EU's interior ministers' meeting on refugee issues, Orpo spoke on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A. 's studio online . Watch the photos on the equipment .
The equipment used by media journalist Timo T.A. Mikko for his television and radio productions, who lost his job due to illness, is now on sale.
Mikkos's wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment on Huuto.net, which at one time was the most advanced professional equipment in her field.
The first online newsletter to report the online announcement was Nightcatcher.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind by technological advances.
In the digital media world, no more television shows are filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interested ones.
The hardware is not as modern as it is today, of course, but it is needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of fans, collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen, who thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is because the Mikkos are trying to move away from their current home in the Storm.
We can't take all the stuff we have with us.
I've been slowly inventing and looking at what stuff to give away.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
From the traces of recent strokes, it's clear that a man with a long career will never return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that we're only selling merchandise and equipment now.
In the summer, Timo T.A. Mikkos's real life work was archived at the National Audiovisual Institute, where representatives visited the box office to pick up films and other material from Myrsky.
Traffic is threatened with a worse-than-expected gridlock: Metro and tram could stop all Friday
The drivers of the subway and the tram will decide today whether to extend their efforts to demonstrate on Friday.
The original plan was to halt subway and tram traffic only for the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, we'll decide if traffic stops for the day.
Chief of the Trust, Pekka Hirvonen, says the threat is high on the ground.
Night and day operations are a major irritant to drivers, and the government's plans to cut the lice are facing opposition.
But the monster thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the capital area will be almost completely stopped.
According to the VR, trains do not run between the hours of morning and evening on Fridays.
Friday's free of near and far traffic.
Trains leaving before dawn will be taken to the station.
HSL says most of the buses are stuck in the parking lot.
The ACP members are absent from work on Friday mornings from 3am to 3am on Saturday mornings.
It is likely that a small number of buses will be able to be operated, they will be operated by commander-in-chief, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo estimates.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus routes will run on Friday.
The employers' organisations are organising a big protest at Helsinki Railway Centre on Friday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident happened on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, reports the AP news agency.
Sky News reports that the refugees have attempted to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would have also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas . A teacher thought his watch was a bomb .
In Texas, U.S.A., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after a teacher held a homemade watch he had brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his income from his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended when the boy was taken in handcuffs to the youth's detention cell.
Muhammad has never been found to have claimed anything other than to have made a watch.
Still, it's possible that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said the watch looked like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The case happened last Monday and Mohamed was sentenced to three days of forced schooling.
Her father is furious about the case, and the country's American Muslim Council is considering whether the case is yet another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is on the verge of a breakdown . Labour leader refuses to sing the national anthem .
The song asks God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been echoed by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, Labour's representative Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial service honored the battle of the British Air Force against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Mr Corbyn in its official statement and stresses that he showed respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in immense debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement noted.
The election of Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party has divided the ranks of the Labour Party.
Members of Parliament in particular are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, the end of austerity and increased public spending.
Mr Corbyn is due to make his first appearance as leader of the party in Parliament today at the prime minister's prime time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should be asked.
Cameron tweeted this week about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is a threat to our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the prime minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family death remains unclear. The family's father was awaiting trial.
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family homicide in Greenwood, Minnesota, for the past week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with his first shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of his house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house to inspect it and found the Shorts dead in a huge house all over the place.
According to Star Tribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Millionaire and a Successful Business
The case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood work remains unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur who had created his fortune on a social media site dedicated to nurses, AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors a week.
I've been asked about 50 offers for the company over the last 10 years.
I've given up all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe I'll sell the company sometime, but not yet.
Among other things, Short's family bought a vacant house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the Zillowice real estate website as a collector's dream: not only do the house have 12 rooms, but it also has a garage for eight cars.
The case is pending .
But according to the Star Tribune, the family's father was awaiting trial.
Achieve Test Prep, which offered various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, the Short website did not remove comments that were offensive to the Prep courses and, as a result, they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial had had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered us some cupcakes.
In addition, the owner's third was awarded the Finnish Hippo of the Month Horse Owner Award for feeding.
This is great. Loiri commented on her honorary table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September and earned a prize of €100,000.
The artist legend Loiri was still baffled by the success of Fabrice Duo in the Grand Prix.
I still don't think it happened.
The winning horse trainer Korpi is accompanied by Loir, who enjoys complete peace of mind when working with the horse.
The horse is the one who decides where to race.
And I'm going to hold my ass, Loiri bitch.
The most amazing gesture of an NHL star, "the greatest gift of any athlete ever".
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's press release, this is the largest single donation to charity by an athlete in Canada.
Subban, 26, has also pledged to help the hospital with other fundraising efforts over the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens a year ago.
So Subban's donation is significantly higher than his annual share of $9 million.
As a reward for his contributions, Subban will receive a hall named after him from the hospital.
Canadiens players have already made significant contributions to local hospitals.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised money for another major hospital in the city to get the PET scan needed for cancer research.
You can order a Japanese coffee for your wife 's dinner . They only serve food in bikinis and a donkey on top .
I mean, tea cabbage is a tough thing in Japan.
There's a goat shop, a chicken shop, a vampire shop, a hawk shop, and now a bridal shop.
It hits lonely, uncomfortable, hungry people.
The Metro reported it.

Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the grid: Arming for attacks on car security
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the industry, according to a press release from Intel.
The board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
The ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing security tests and reviews to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of its cybersecurity best practices.
The company will update the report in the future on the basis of the results of the ASRB investigation.
The Commission has also examined the potential for the use of the new technologies in the field of transport and the use of the new technologies.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate shows that 60 to 75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
We can and must improve car cybersecurity, says Intel Security CEO Chris Young.
The ASRB enables Intel to consolidate best security practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of any connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been expected for years like the moon rises.
Finally, the car is starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the automotive world is watching the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-cylinder RS is powered by a 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine that accelerates from zero to 100 mph in 4.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 266 km/h.
The price is also interesting in Finland, with a preliminary estimate of EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for purchase, although Ford will not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
At the Frankfurt Motor Show , the popular Kia brand introduced two new features - the new Sportage and the Optima .
Of the two Finnish innovations, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important, with which Kia intends to take a bigger lead in the ever-growing street-to-door market.
The new Sportage, designed by European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more round.
The axis and the outer edges have moved one inch from here to here, and the car is breaking through the air more efficiently.
The engine range remains largely the same, but it has been supplemented by a 1.6-litre turbocharged V8 engine with 177 horsepower.
More on Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption is reported as sales revenue.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we're getting a new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Before the turn of the year, we'd have the new Kia Optimas.
At first glance, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia plans to win the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-end equipment.
The Optimus will be equipped with a 1.7-litre turbocharged diesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when the Optima GT comes alongside them, equipped with a 2.0-liter turbo engine.
At the same time as it comes, the Optima Farmer goes on sale.
Chisu returned to the lagoon, and exploded in a brave, unarmed gallows.
Singer Chisu is in the Life for a Child concert with other local stars.
The electric blue pants have a nice, open neck hole.
The costume is a beautiful representation of the singer's belt of a scissor.
The crown of the whole is a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has been able to curb her pregnant bodies with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter's about to turn one.
The singer released her first single from her new album in August.
I'm not really excited about going back to the lawns and standing up to a big audience after a long break.
"I've missed everything about music", says the singer.
Chisu is releasing a new album in a couple of weeks and her fourth album, Polaris.
Your new state of life has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people will find my new record, Chisu is wondering.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood style is stunning again. Now you can see her breasts.
The reality show beauty Kim Kardashian is giving one conversation after another.
She's presenting her pregnancy and breastfeeding in a sexy dress, last night at 1:00 a.m. American time, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It exposes the skinny breastplate underneath the dress in flash of lightning.
The last time Kardashian wore a professional maternity suit was when she went to a friend's house for dinner in New York just a few days ago.
The black super-generation shoes were the highlight of the outfit.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last Friday when the show was about to begin.
The strict rules of the fashion world: No home, lonely, competition terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted a short-term idea that the modeling world would be pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths out about pure fashion.
Harpeer's Bazaar has put together six hard truths from Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you'd been posing in the costumes of some of the top designers last season, the new season will start again with casting.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces coming into the industry competing for jobs with conquerors.
I mean, models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is a constant journey, and it can take years for a hotel room or apartment to accommodate models.
If you are too young and your mother cannot accompany you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most desirable jobs, but they're the most stressful of them all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risk.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and they act as a support network.
When fashion week ends, the difference is blurred.
Models want to go into this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they're annoyed that everyone thinks the job is just a showcase for clothes.
Models want to be their own people.
The work makes models feel like they're actors with roles.
But the model's job can also express itself.
You were a model at Tory Burch's show last night.
New York City is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers unveil their next year's models.
Roope Salminen , who changed his style , plays the most unknown piece of music in the movie
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in the film based on the early years of the Apuliana group.
Lautala founded Apuliana in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but left the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a rapper about to turn 26, and in this movie, I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen, laughing.
I've never wanted to meet the real Ant before the shoot, because I want to make my own interpretation of her.
And Antti is obviously unfamiliar to those people, so I think it's a good idea that I learn her playing style from the video.
I don't want to do a human imitation.
A man who trusts the Roope Salmen and the Dogs union for nothing is not the source of the role.
Punk manners are a man's nature.
I'm sure many of you who've ever been to our shows in the punk era of "Stars, Stars" will have seen the premiere.
Our performance has never been anything small-time, but we always go full-time.
The cast of the film You Made Us Beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temes, who played bass as an assistant from 1993 to 2004, was announced today.
The core of the band, familiar to the public, is a group of young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukkia is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Blue House and bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about her upcoming wedding as early as last night when she revealed on Snapchat that she was mysteriously preparing for the biggest day of her career.
Roope posted a photo of her new look on Instagram yesterday that she had to make for a movie.
Roope, who was previously seen with a mustache and a leather beard, has been wearing eyelashes and has dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to wonder how to tell their child about the situation of refugees seeking to Europe.
Or is it worth telling me about it?
There is no need to force the issue, advises SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
Younger children should be protected, not allowed to watch the news alone, for example.
Little children may not always understand what they see, and it can be distracting and distressing, she says.
However, if a child has seen or heard news on television about refugees, it is worth talking about.
It is good to start the conversation with the child's point of view and to listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You can't scare a child for nothing, even if it's a pain in the ass and a scare.
A younger child closely follows his parents' behavior.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child feels safe.
Older children are likely to encounter discussion about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
Parents should discuss matters with them if the child is thinking about them.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents and children can discuss how our family is responding to this.
But do we think the world is a safe place after all?
Parents may also have different educational views - some of whom may want to protect their children from stress as much as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also discusses difficult matters, the child will be given an example of how to deal with the challenges of life ahead.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
Your own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
The Vermont strikes the ball field hard to control
The North Pole was hit by a car in the middle of the autumn.
It only fed on the profits and the second-place finishers until the end of July, when the Tampere rave collapsed.
Because the animal had slipped to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protection from a veterinarian.
The explanation for the blackout came out in the blink of an eye.
The horse had a sore throat.
The disease was not the mildest, but it required two doses of medicine to suppress it.
Since the Apilla Ballosalama had to be lightly trained, Pohjola says he was positively surprised by the horse's final run.
It was the second SE-dams in the market at its peak after Tartuul.
The Apella Ball Slam was under great pressure at the break, having been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
The slight tendency to take these things into account at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the Orioles sharp.
The horse's turn must have gone on from there, and I hope it was even.
The Appalachian Trail has been called the "Humor Horse".
If it's not fun, it could have gotten fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, slaves have been freed from such a slave trade that their opponents have been amazed.
At high speed, competitors cannot handle the Ballroom, which even warm-blooded rides take off.
The wishes of the North are a steak race in Vermo.
But the difference is how the Apple Ballroom will agree.
It's kind of hard to get out of here, and you can even put a knife under the top of the van and stuff like that.
I hope the slave is calmer now than when Turu leaves.
The Apella Ballgame can come out of the cage in good shape, and we're gonna go for a win, Coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone apps.
Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple's iPhone may be removed in the future, but not all.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its own software from iPhone phones in the future, CEO Tim Cook told Buzzfeed.
There are a number of apps on Apple's iPhone that relatively few people use, such as FaceTime calls, News Feed, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tink.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a compulsory update to iPhone phones, although it is only needed by Apple Watch owners.
Cook says removing Apple's software is a lot more complicated than it looks.
Some of the apps are linked to something on another iPhone.
If they're removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps worked well with the other apps.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company doesn't want to waste memory on users' iPhones.
Euro area inflation fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by the decline in energy prices.
Eurostat revised its 0.2% forecast slightly downwards a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
The Eurostat forecast for underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
Average inflation in the EU was zero in August across the 28 countries.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
The highest level of consumer prices in the euro area, or 1.4%, rose in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was at its lowest, with prices falling by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's harmonised price index.
The euro area's inflation rate remains firmly far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a 2% price rise in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
The growth rate will increase to 1.1% next year, as the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
The Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy next .
The next US recession will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years of the Fed's long-term interest rate hikes.
And the financial markets are going to be down before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may start interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next recession could hit its fastest by next autumn and the financial market will be heading in the direction of that.
Or at least that's what's going to happen if the world's biggest economies and financial markets are functioning as they have always been and if they're responding to the Fed's tightening of the money supply as they've done before.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action to address the situation in the Union.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who wrote the study and report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will raise interest rates or what will happen to the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations of financial statements to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they examine what key economic and financial market variables are now in the same or different pattern as at the time of previous interest rates - and what the potential consequences are.
Clearly, both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better position to withstand interest rate increases than at any time since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession , maybe not a year .
The leaders of the Fed's monetary policy and its costly reform have been hinting since last summer and early in the year that the time has come for a ripe rate hike.
The first surge in more than nine years could happen this week.
The matter will be resolved within the next Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed's Executive Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds rate was in June 2006.
The Fed's two-year series of relatively regular but low interest rates of 0.25 percentage points ended with a rate increase from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market began to sink in 2007 with the difficulties of the most high-risk housing finance in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the severe reversals in the financial markets and the real economy started slower than they have typically been since the previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were more severe and harsh than ever before the 1930's depression.
Deutschen strategists have been scanning the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the financial market since 1950 and at various points since the early 19th century.
They've been making sense of the Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial implications since the 1950s.
The first round of the Census has been the fastest since the start of the recession, with less than a year, usually less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The financial market price rise has ended within a year or two of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
The Fed has raised and lowered its interest rates in turn since the early 1950s, at the rate of a dozen different cycles.
Each time has diverged from the others in some respects and the times are relatively small, so that it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions on the effects of subsequent interest increases.
The strategies remind us that this time, a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
You 're taking too much interest .
The decisive causes of the financial crisis may not be undeniably revealed even after decades of investigation.
But three things about the crisis and the reasons for its devastating effects are probably somewhat indisputable:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and the other world's largest central banks kept their central rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They were repairing the traces of the tech couple while growing the next one.
2) The debt accumulated over decades in various sectors of the financial and real economy, and which has already been too large, has been exacerbated by the influence of monetary policy over-investment by central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history since then.
3) In particular, the debt financing crisis, which was almost a long-term one for the financial economy, has inflated the largest price pairs in the financial history of most financial markets, from stocks to real estate, debts and commodities.
It is hardly a hard question to argue that the financial markets, which have risen to higher levels under increasingly complex debt conditions, were rarely in a dangerous and unstable position when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures adjusted for debt relief did not last until after interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realized in the form of a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
The Deutschen strategists do not predict what will happen next, but they give a point of reference by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy reforms even lighter, even longer, than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have been even lower for even longer.
(2) Borrowing has long been less expensive than ten years ago, but now debt is literally cheaper than free.
So the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now in different parts of the economy there is a more severe debt burden than before or half of the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity released from the formerly more borrowing and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has slowed down key securities and asset classes to their most expensive levels, whether at pre-crisis peak or ever.
And not only do the strategists not only tone down the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the most severe recession in decades to the model it has ever seen before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the financial market pressures and risks are unparalleledly higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed is next tightening its monetary policy.
Perhaps the vision of the future of Albert Edwards, strategist of the French bank Societe General, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has been training the bank's international investment clients for a long time to make the following full changes to the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to shut down the financial markets with even bigger QE financial scandals.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The company said that most of the reductions will be in HP's corporate services sector.
HP will be split in November between Hewlett Packard Enterprises, which focuses on sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP's peak was in 2011, when it employed 350000 people.
In October last year, the number of staff was reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off expenditure of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) on the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is cutting 25 to 30 thousand employees.
The reduction in the consumer benefit will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees are in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are now responsible for more than 10% of its business income.
In the second year, its three largest customers accounted for 65% of its turnover.

Minister: Berner has served on the board of the tax havens company
The Minister for Transport and Communications, Anne Berner (Central), has served as a member of the Board of the Tax havens company.
According to Yle, the company's activities were related to the so-called tax planning.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he left the membership notice in May of this year.
I checked the case, and I've left a notice of termination.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains are done on the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the Swedish company Kährs' assets.
Kährs is a parquet dancer who merged with Finnish parquet dancer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor between 2010 and 2013 and, following the merger, on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, the assets of Kährs are held in Luxembourg through a multi-storey ownership structure.
Berner tells Yelle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia Upfloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to ensure the capital interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yelle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure in the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of the capital fund in Kährs, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo is opening a reception centre run by the company
Espoo Otaniem is the first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception desk is ready to take in the first 100 residents as of this evening.
The number of places can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people in a week.
The Immigration Office is setting up a reception centre on the former Salvation College property.
The operation is operated by Luona Oy, which is principally engaged in the production of healthcare and nursing services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Office and Luona Oy agreed on, inter alia, the security arrangements for the centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative work life extortion package
STTK is preparing an alternative package for government workplace challenges.
The organisation also wishes to involve other wage-earners' centre organisations.
President Antti Palola said that the focus was on Friday's rally.
We will then return to alternative means of reducing the price of labour.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola told reporters during a meeting of the organization's board.
Palola considers that the Central League for Living and Working Life (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the changeover insurance included in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package will be EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if the parties are very keen to have a conversation if they have a hundred people on the side.
Palola: The negotiations were constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, when the government is due to deliver a notice of its own package to Parliament and begin preparing for reforms.
Palola was not sure if the timetable was realistic.
The negotiating relationship with the government, according to Palla, exists, and it has been constructive to him all along.
The staff center's organization at the STTK airport, especially the Sunday morning surgery, is a painful place, according to Palo.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation that would implement some of the blackmail.
According to Palla, the STTK does not welcome the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP that brought the matter before it.
Employers will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest the government's last week's work-life tightening package.
The package includes, for example, reductions in wages for the first days of sickness, halving overtime, reducing Sunday allowances to 75% and shortening holidays.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to express their views and that the strike was not intended.
AKAVA Fjäder thanks you
The President of the ACA, Sture Fjäder, welcomes the announcement by STTK that an alternative package has been prepared.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now coming to the same lines as Akava, as Akava has already long been designed as an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, since without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Sture Fjäder, President of the ACA, wishes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lylly, will join us in preparing the presentation as an alternative to surgery.
The STTK of Antti Palola said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want a safe transfer and a working time ban.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it had been preparing its own proposal for a long time, in which it was ready to negotiate the government's goal of a 5% competitiveness deficit as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long written alternative models for government proposals.
We're prepared to consider the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want security of movement and working time", says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join the Akava lines, as STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to develop a model that will go to the government and employers, says Fjäder.
The Akwa Working Committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the same wreckage" - playing bingo while Silvia talks in the evening
Green left at the University of Tampere
The Green Left of the University of Tampere's Vivan bingo club for the evening.
Prime Ministers have previously delivered exceptional speeches during the Beltway riots and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation on the economic situation in Finland on Yle Channel on Wednesday night at 9.05pm.
The time for the request for such a speech by the Prime Minister is 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister, giving a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Rebellion in the Land.
After that, the president and the ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter War and the subsequent war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave the New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the railroad strike in a televised speech.
The one-man show, the monarchist meanness.
The speech by the spider has been a source of criticism and speculation all day about what's to come.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, tweeted that "Sipila could make his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "the one-on-one conversation has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Judge condemned on Facebook that "monarchist manners: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
The SDP chairman, Antti Rinne, challenged the Sibilla dialogue: "More than six months after the elections.
Not even a prime minister's appearance in the media with the opposition.
I tried.
What's the feast boy afraid of?
Public service
According to the State Council Office, Sipila's speech was pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not yet received any information on the situation in the Member States.
The audience has been critical of Sipila's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was the public service's task to promote comprehensive publicity throughout Finland, as Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle Publications, told the news.
Like we were in the days of the Tammel
The speech has also sparked outrage.
When the evening comes, dinner is served in good time, the children are frightened and dressed to their best.
Mom puts a more beautiful strap on her and Dad ties the tie around her neck.
At nine o'clock, the silence is on the television as it was in the days of Me Tammeloides", writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government has billionaires hiding in tax havens, writing amnesty laws for their fellow taxpayers and telling the people that they must cut when the state runs out of money?" asks Pia Piaikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Leftist Viva of Tampere University.
It's posted a side-by-side bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, the same debt, the same team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, 9:05 p.m. and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
The Guardian: Western countries reject Russian proposal to expel Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rejected a Russian offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Akhtar, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan to remove Assad from power in a stylish fashion after a while.
However, the West did not accept the proposal, believing that al-Assad would fall in a matter of weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Mr Ahtisaar said that during the bilateral talks, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tsurkin had listed three points of the plan: the opposition should not be armed, dialogue between the opposition and al-Assad should be established immediately and the abdication of al-Assad should be done with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can have an open discussion.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Marty, and I'll tell you what we need to do, Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting .
Ahtisaari says he sent Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Mr. Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Mr. Ahtisaar said there were no words.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaar's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups had refused any agreements that would have allowed him to remain in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Office, is hesitant to accept Mr Ahtisaar's remarks because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Mr Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaar's claim is that Tshurkin spoke on behalf of Moscow.
If he had told me about Tsurkin's speech, I would have said I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was Putin's spark to take power from some al-Assad supporter.
The flow of refugees from our own actions
During the negotiations that took place in Ahtisaar, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been displaced by war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own act.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We're now paying the bill we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari told the paper.
The asylum seeker's centre in Turku, Turku
The planned centre for asylum seekers in Northern Finland, planned by the Government, is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tower community building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki newspaper reported on Tuesday that the municipality had already decided to submit the school building to the Ministry for a public offering.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, Deputy Mayor of the Borough of Tornion (left), this is not true.
When the whole council was not in session and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he told STT.
There were 36 delegates at the debate, out of 43.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
On the basis of this, we can expect the decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen said the city received a call on Monday and responded quickly.
The community would have an estimated capacity of 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking whether it could be used for this purpose.
The site is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
The Owl still wants the labour market to offer an alternative to blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), the public halving of holiday funds would only cover part of the government's aim of lowering the price of work.
The Government, however, agrees that it will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners can agree on it.
Mr Sipilä told reporters in the parliament that he had not been in contact with the trade unions.
He also had no idea how seriously organizations were looking for alternatives to government-announced workplace harassment.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the whole package.
In the opinion of Mr Sipila, a halving of holiday funds would be a viable option, as it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's Sunday morning cut.
The social partners could agree to cut the holiday allowance between themselves because it is recorded in the labour contracts rather than in the law.
The Government will present its views to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the work life tightening in a Council communication.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the European Union is a very important one.
That's not the final limit.
The legislative work then starts, which means the train is moving and it gets harder and harder.
It's time to go.
It's not long in a thing like this, if you will, said Sipilä.
The list published last week by the government includes the transition of the working hours and the holiday to unpaid days without reducing the number of working hours.
In addition, the first sick days' wages will be cut, overtime payments halved, Sunday payments reduced to 75% and holidays shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as compulsory legislation beyond trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
The workers' union organises a general strike on Friday, and several unions have declared political strikes.
The Lake Tohma Board approved the extension of the storage facility
The Lake Toh Board unanimously but slightly approved the extension of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy, the manure house.
The reason for the review was that the project was larger and more expensive than originally envisaged.
I'm also busy with the schedule.
It was a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, an extension of the 400-450 square metres of the stock was approved for the investment programme, but the funds will be decided on in the context of the quarterly report.
The list of proposals still included a EUR 150 000-200 000 investment, but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings jobs and tax revenue to the local community.
The company does not have any risk as it pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Västost (ps.) argued.
The cattle tongue has a place in the river
The city has eased its previously strong stance to bring cattle-speaking street names to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the traditional cattle elections throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared as the capital of the Cattle Language because it has no historical basis and the Cattle Language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joseon area is more of an Eastern Savoy dialect.
After the new decision, there will be no cattle-speaking street rides in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is also, on a case-by-case basis, well prepared to use the cattle language, for example in information tables and in tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the cattle language should also be taken with a grain of salt now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Carolina.
The language of Karjala is still a distinctive feature of the province, as is the image of Joensu as a forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used well in the county's many marketing activities.
The disconnection of the railway lines is cutting off the province's vitality.
The train cuts are hitting the county's vitality with a hard hand.
The transport links directly affect the business life and competitiveness of the province.
And that will affect whether it is even possible to live and work here, as the mayor of Jensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which he has also covered on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that we do not reduce our chances of success with state measures, as we are doing now.
The impact of the closure of these transport links on employment, for example, should be considered.
The deterioration of road connections is causing further challenge to the attractiveness of the University of Eastern Finland.
Of course, the better the services available, such as transport and housing, the easier it will be to get students and workers, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He notes that poor transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment Director Marko Junkkarinen says that even at the moment, marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult because of the poor traffic links.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland are currently from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, partly because of direct train connections.
From the river came one of my sorrows to the battle of the Beatitudes
The views of the Joseun City Council on the Siun Sotse project are apparently unanimous, but one vote is also among them.
City councillor Pentti Keskisalo (pictured) presented his resignation from the project at the board meeting on Monday, but his proposal was rejected.
The Council approved the proposal of Mayor Kari Karjalaine, which will be reviewed in early October before the City Council meeting, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train ride from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year.
Passenger train traffic from Eagle to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one train is less common.
Passenger train services between Eagle and Kouvola will be changed in March.
One couple of trainers gets away, but still five times a day they get from Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government savings.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications's train purchases will be reduced by EUR 12,3 million over the next four years.
The quietest routes will be completely closed.
VR will be setting new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one didn't get down, the guys slipped.
The rescue team let a 12-year-old climb up the roof from a ladder, but he couldn't get off the roof.
The situation was born in the Tower of Ketosis at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday night.
There's an old two-story wooden house on the site, with no stairs to the roof at all.
It did not stop a group of boys from climbing to the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next door.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped off the scene, and passersby alerted the rescue unit to help the last person safely returned to the surface with a tow truck.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet established the existence of a significant increase in the Union industry's turnover.
FedEx has released its weakest quarterly results, with the transport industry leaving its year-round earnings forecast weak due to declining demand for freight services and rising costs of overland transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell by about 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the actual trading opened on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast for the fiscal year ending May is $10.40 to $10.90, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
According to FactSet, the analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened despite price increases of 4.9% on average, with increases coming into force on 4 January, and additional charges for heavy or large shipments coming into force in November.
The company still expects revenue growth from the previous year, thanks to cost cuts, increased turnover and increased online sales.
Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO, said that the company had performed well in the face of a much weaker economic situation, which has particularly challenged production and global trade.
The seasonal employee compensation plans were announced the day after competitor UPS announced its plans to hire almost the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90 000-95 000 people.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, up six percent.
The earnings per share were $2.42, which means that 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research were left with a $2.44 forecast.
The revenue increased five percent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
FedEx has experienced a decline in international first-class shipments in recent years, which has led to a downturn in the operations of its Express unit.
The strong growth in online commerce has been confirmed by the results of FedEx Ground.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor in the Union.
The Express unit was more productive due to higher basic charges, while the freight business' revenue decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trade opening, the FedEx stock price had dropped $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share fell 11% from the year-on-year average and 17% below the highest level recorded on 11 June.
This week, Fed leaders will meet for the most anticipated meeting in years, with a crowd sitting at a 12-foot-wide Honduran tree stand to decide if it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The central bank's decorative, two-story meeting room is decorated with a mural depicting the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the financial interests of the State ahead of all other interests.
The central bank has a double mandate from Congress: maximum hours of employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, after the Great Depression, the central bank's management has noted a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
The mandate may be missing in the face of a sharp decision, and the central bank is due to announce on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to begin a recovery from the unforeseen stimulus of short interest rates that remained close to zero at the end of 2008.
While most data indicate a steady growth of the economy, the recent financial market slump may already lead prudent central bank officials to fear increasing volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate by at least a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are naturally the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Banking.
"However, I believe that if the central bank seeks an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in global markets should give enough time to wait", Piegza continues.
The central bank's intentions are not agreed by the reviewers, which is itself a source of anxiety.
About half of the economists in a study by Bloomberg complained about interest rate hikes this week.
However, the financial market is estimated to be expected by the central bank, and according to the key indicator, only 30% of the potential for a drawdown.
If the central bank raises its benchmark rate, the stock prices may fall unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising a second raise.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday dropped 228.89 points, or 1.4 percentage points, to 16,599.85.
"The backdrop for the recovery was expectations that the central bank would keep the benchmark rate stable this week", said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raises interest rates at this stage", he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about keeping the hands of the financial market unshaken".
The experts, on the other hand, argued that raising interest rates could calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank appeared to be inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in tightening financing conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said that he expected interest rates to rise this year throughout the spring and early autumn, despite the fact that the liberals believe economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, and is now at its lowest level in seven years, close to what the Central Bank calls full employment.
The payroll seems to be rising .
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual 2% target, central bank policy makers stated that the main reason for this was the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can and will need higher interest rates, provided that they take into account the tight labour market situation", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the global financial markets were not shocked last month when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by up to 16 percentage points from its record high in May and investors feared that the Chinese recession would also affect global growth.
The market has been up and down this month, and the Dow Jones has now fallen almost 10 percent from its May peak.
The weakening of the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank will find it even more difficult to consider raising the central rate.
"The central bank's work is complicated despite what has happened in the financial markets and the news of China's economic downturn in recent weeks", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
He now believes the central bank will wait at least a month before it can deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about the impact on the U.S. economy, and there is little reliable information on the post-recent development situation in China", Oliner said.
The recovery of the world economy is not a central bank's main concern and should therefore in principle not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential entity in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, the mere suggestion by then-President Ben S. Bernanke that the Central Bank could reduce its scope of operations led to revolutions around the world.
In the modern world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring global trends, the central bank is required to engage with other central banks and experts to gain a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, global strategy director at Envestnet Inc.
The Chairman of the Regional Bank of Richmond, Jeffrey Lacker, said this month that the central bank had previously overreacted to financial market movements that did not appear to be linked to the core of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for the increase of the threshold, citing the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian financial crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to lower the benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points, despite only limited identified sanctions for U.S. economic growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank reversed the decision.
"The central bank should only put monetary stability first in a major crisis, such as the 2008 financial collapse", said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The last deafness is not even close to that", he said.
"There is no reason to fear interest rate hikes because of market shocks", added Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it doesn't mention monetary stability, and until that changes, I shouldn't go ahead".

The Brazilian Association of Paediatricians of the Rio Grande promotes healthy diets for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Association of Pediatricians of Rio Grande has developed a blind way to teach breastfeeding women the importance of a healthy diet by showing them pictures of babies being breastfed with pictures of unhealthy foods painted on them.
Human breast milk is made up of protein, fat, vitamins, and carbohydrates, so that the baby gets all the nutrition he needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 kilocalories.
In addition to increasing calories, a new study suggests that other dietary changes should be made.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet in a pregnant woman can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on a child's immune system.
Seven Sunrises has the most viewers, even though Nine is trying to take over the top spot on their Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson challenged Canberra to make a morning show about the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership election, but this did not improve Today's viewership.
The morning show on Nine was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull's ouster of Tony Abbott.
The morning program, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytagen, was broadcast from London, with weekly specials also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance was apparently not significant to Australian television viewers, with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers in the five provincial capitals and Today 339,000.
The number of viewers increased slightly from last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000), but last Thursday's figure was still low (343 000).
Today has been closing its distance to Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 viewers, while Sunris had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The changes in the winds will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and with the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
A significant novelty for Seven was the 800 Words news series, which features former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson would be enough to star in the hit series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's viewership figures show that the answer is clearly yes.
Seven's The X Factor retained its strong position with 1,136,000 viewers, and the series decisively defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL's Families (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers on a variety of occasions.
The first half hour of Andrew O'Keeffe's new series of videos (17.00-17:30 p.m.) averaged 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (17:30-18:00), viewership increased to 623,000, as if more than on Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half garnered a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat was watched by 620,000.
The second night of The Chase Australia, the viewership figures showed Nine that Hot Seat will be over by 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final three think Sam Wood is indeed the son of Dreams, but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly exposed the choice of the boy of dreams.
The final choice of Sam Wood, the boy of dreams, has been a closely guarded secret.
The three remaining women don't say a word about who got the last rose from the boy.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markos and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about their mood before one of the three was dropped, and the women could have inadvertently hinted at who would be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women were flattered that Wood was the perfect man, and they praised his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity, and they considered him a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who would be Wood's best mate if the last rose didn't hit their own spot, their answers might suggest who would take a boy's heart.
The Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the most suitable partner for Wood after himself.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been a little bit of a walk in the park since the beginning.
"On arriving at the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were very close, and that feeling has remained throughout the program", said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarahil has her feet on the ground, and she's a really fun companion", Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit, there's a chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay said he realized last week at his hometown convention that Wood might be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a race, but I am now fully committed to our relationship", Mackay said.
When asked who Wood would choose if he didn't choose her, she answered mysteriously,
"I can't tell", he said.
"I like the other girls just as much, Snezana and Lana are equal".
The boy of dreams on the Ten Channel Wednesday at 7:30.

Jarryd Hayne has several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after he moved to the United States, and several other clubs were also interested in him after his impressive open practice day last year.
Hayne picked the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have put Hayne on the bench, as the man did in the ranks of the Australian rugby union team, when Hayne was watching the team take a return victory on Tuesday from Minnesota on a 20-3 run.
However, Tomsula showed his confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the plane, and the coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula continued his line in the dressing room after the game.
He didn't just cheat the incoming in front of the rest of the team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers special correspondent Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is watching the capture, the game against the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
Hayne and his Australian fan base had been expecting a different man from his NFL debut.
Hayne retired from the field after a fall for a hundred and later told 2DayFM 104.1 to Hamish and Andy that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"These things hurt, and we have to move on", Hayne said.
Hayne made a mistake when he made his debut in the 2007 series of State of Origin when his entry into his own territory opened a place for Queensland.
Yet, the experience as a whole was incredible for a 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo on Instagram posing with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun at a Syrian airport.
President Vladimir Putin's openly challenged Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Jukos was liquidated and his pro-democracy work was restricted.
Four dead police officers shot dead in rubber bands in Nepal
Four people died in southern Nepal, an official source said on Wednesday, when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd at a rally allegedly against the country's new constitution, including a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, less than 300 kilometers from the capital Kathmandu.
According to district chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before the rubber bullets were fired.
He said 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber rodents, which can kill but are generally considered less destructive, suddenly became so lethal.
This was the latest clash in weeks of protests in the southern provinces of Nepal, where the Madhesi tribe said the new provinces based on the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have died in violent clashes since August 10,
The first is that the new constitution is a major step towards a new constitution, but the issue is very sensitive in Nepal, where the government has been centralised for centuries.
A new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but legislators have been speeding up the process after thousands of people died in the devastating earthquake in April.
Legislators have voted on the constitutional text in Kathmandu this week, and officials say the new constitution could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC hurricane center: 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde
A tropical cyclone is likely to develop within the next 48 hours, some 200 miles (560 km) of the wide low-pressure area south of Cape Verde, the National Hurricane Center reported Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, a clear low pressure centre is also located in the middle of Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles, which could also develop into a tropical cyclone with a 60% chance of developing over the next two days.
Google is planning to raise $11 million for the refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations helping thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in a very personal way on its blog.
Instead of being the CEO, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud, who shared her own experiences when she was just seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear", Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has been exacerbated, many families in a similar situation are in dire need of help.
The donations are directed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations Refugee Agency.
After the donations have been collected through google.com/refugeerelief for $5.5 million, Google promises to donate the same amount, bringing the total to over 11 million.
The refugee crisis in Europe is at its worst since the Second World War, exacerbated in particular by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also force people to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

A slightly overweight diabetic may benefit from obesity surgery
A new study suggests that mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"It takes time to get death data", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who covered a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the opening by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food by the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have involved patients with a disease-causing obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index shall be expressed as a weight to length ratio with a normal value of 18,524,9.
When the body weight index is over 25, a person is overweight, and a body weight index over 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two obesity surgeries, a hip-hop surgical procedure and a hip-hop surgical procedure, to treat mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes.
After the operation, the mean weight index dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth study year.
The weight index of those who received non-surgical treatment remained at 29.
The total improvement in diabetes among those treated with surgery was 36 percent and partial 28 percent.
In the group treated with medication, diabetes improved completely by only 1 percent and partially by only about 2 percent.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides, and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical group.
The researchers also monitored patients' hemoglobin A1c levels, which describe blood sugar development.
The researchers recommend that the recommended level of hemoglobin A1c is less than 7%.
After the surgery, the hemoglobin A1c decreased on average from 9% to 6%.
In the group receiving treatment, the value remained at about 8%.
However, the study team led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study team also compared the results of two different surgical procedures.
For the fifth year, the weight loss in the bypass group was greater than in the muscle-cutting group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight loss index was greater (7.4 and 5.1), and the hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent), and the diabetes in the interstitial surgery group also improved significantly (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
The new study failed to show a lower mortality rate after five years, but according to a Swedish study by Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgical treatment brings years of life to obese people.
In a Swedish study, the likelihood of death in obese people who had a vaginal bypass surgery decreased by 29 percent over 15 years compared to the group receiving traditional treatment.
Although the new study did not detect any lower mortality, according to Blackstone, it was confirmed that people with a weight index of less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding in the study, as it shows that surgery is safe for the lower-weight group and does not increase the risk of dying or kidney disease", Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take their weight seriously when the weight index is 2730.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously", the researcher said.
"When the human body has accumulated genetic changes that are susceptible to obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation".
"Not everyone can come to Europe"
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, and that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during his visit to the United Kingdom, and the Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
The Dalai Lama says that in the current situation, humanity must be put before individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible to imagine that everyone could come to Europe", the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"It is a wonderful thing to take care of thousands of refugees, but at the same time it is important to consider long-term solutions and how to achieve true peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education", the Dalai Lama stressed.
"We have to think about how we can reduce murder in these countries.
We need to reduce the power consumption.
The problem has never been solved by force", he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the context of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the United States, by resorting to force in response to the terrorist attack, created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the September 11 attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force, with unpredictable consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
In children, the number of cases of hand swallowing quadrupled in four years.
According to the Georgia Toxicology Center, poisoning centers across the United States report that alcohol-related cases of severe hand swallowing have nearly quadrupled in children under 12 since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Toxicity Centre, reported hand swallowing in children under 12 years of age to poisoning centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are becoming more and more available to children, and unfortunately some of them are going to first aid", Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink their hands on purpose, partly to impress their friends and partly to be encouraged by social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking a disinfectant for a cheap beer.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcohol-containing oral water with a disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Younger children may be attracted to the smell of handkerchiefs.
"The child doesn't think the substance is evil", Lopez said.
"Many of the most attractive handmade products are just scented.
There are tasty handmade items of peanut, grapefruit, and orange that appeal to children".
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is 45 to 95 per cent.
Even small amounts can cause alcohol poisoning in young children.
"The alcohol content in the container is very high", Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital Toxicology Center, told Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whisky hat for children, but if hand sanitizers are often left for children, they quickly become high in alcohol".
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four lorax of sweet-smelling strawberries at school, and the girl was taken to the ER for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, double the level of an adult's", says Chris Ritchey, a doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was soaked up and couldn't walk when he was brought to the ER.
Doctors monitored her condition overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking", said Ritchey.
"The situation was really frightening", Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products and disinfectant towels, in addition to putting their hands out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a hand containing an unreportedly toxic substance.
The health authorities considered that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is indicated in the product description as an active substance.
According to a police report, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to kill a "fierce" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handcuffs and forbade them to be brought into the classroom.
The police considered the mythical plan to be meaningless and urged the school to take disciplinary action.
Rummy: not a bad boy in the Celtic 's ranks
Griffith underestimates the lack of consistency in the Celtic team, while Deila admits that not everything is going well in the team but believes he can make things right.
Hearts clashed with the SFA over Neilson's punishment, and Warburton is looking to save the January transfer window so the team's unity doesn't suffer.
Aberdeen 's neck to the Celtics . Five points .
The first half penalty brought Aberdeen a slight victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium, which lifted Aberdeen's five points away from Celtic.
Griffiths is downplaying the disrespectful talk.
Griffiths has ignored rumors of a lack of support in Celtic's ranks, saying Griffiths and his team are not being watched as they prepare to face the head of the Dutch team.
"I don't think we're under any pressure, and I think the players are looking forward to meeting.
The Dutch are longing for an old Scottish fighter.
Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has confirmed that Dutch football fans have stopped being interested in Celtic as they no longer have access to the Celtic-Rangers double.
Ajax's manager De Boer said: "The Hall no longer presents the highlights of Celtic's games.
Because the Rangers are gone".
"This isn't just about the Rangers coming back.
This is the Old Firm.
The Dutch want a double-elimination tournament.
There is a tremendous amount of excitement in the Old Firm games, and they are also interesting outside of Scotland".
I'll turn the tide for the better, Deila assures me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic are having a hard time, but the Norwegian's shot assures us that the situation will change.
The team that lost to Malmö dropped out of the Champions League and lost 10 to Aberdeen, who now have a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic have had some tough times before, and we're going to get back up", Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it arouses anger or sorrow.
We do, too, but we have to move on.
We need the support of Celtic fans, because it will give players a lot of strength.
The spirit of community is very important now".
Warburton's careful with the January player transfers.
Even though only a few weeks ago Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at January transfer terms, he's been cautious about the transfer window and says he wants to jeopardize the team's integrity.
"The January transfer window is significantly different from the summer transfer window", said Brentford's former coach.
"The players who join the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful in our lineup this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can cause more harm than good for the team".
A retirement-minded Michu in the Celtic's sights
Swansea forward Michu has joined the Celtics in a player transfer talks, and Michu has hinted at retiring after the Swans deal is over.
Michu, 29, has been tempted by an angry ankle for years, and she has not been able to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA strike for Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was taken off the field, and the team lost 3-2 after the defender's red card was later revoked, the third Collum red card in eight months to be revoked.
But Neilson is not saying that. "I didn't question honesty.
Griffiths swore he would avoid Tyne Castle.
Griffiths was reprimanded for admitting to slandering former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh local match at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming up, and the atmosphere was hot", said the attacker. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except for the Celtic lines".
Tannadick 's management believes in the leadership of Dundee United 's coaching staff .
Simon Donnelly has assured us that the Dundee United management team can make things better, and that surrendering on the pitch is no longer permitted.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for the battle", Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy with Hamilton 's win in a dirty game .
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to struggle desperately to win their seventh straight league title against Hamilton, with Aberdeen clinching the top spot for five points in the Celtics' first half, thanks to a penalty kick from Adam Rooney.
"There is no cup or league winning team that would not have won games like this", McInnes said.
Unemployment remains high in Scotland, rising in the British Isles
The number of unemployed in Scotland remained unchanged in July, with 164,000 unemployed, while the UK as a whole rose by 10,000.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom as a whole.
In Scotland, there are 12 000 fewer people in work than three months ago, and now there are 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the first quarter, while the average in the United Kingdom was 73.5%.
Commenting on the recent figures, Scottish Minister of State David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a strong economy".
Almost exactly one year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The situation on the Scottish labour market has improved over the past year and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for the revocation, I will be executed.
If the execution is carried out, which I don't expect, I'm sitting in the execution chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary while Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January from a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I accepted the invitation.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you the true story of the death penalty.
It would be a unique view.
Journalists can watch executions in the United States, and because there are more applications than places, participants are chosen with a macabre rating.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reporters from 12 to five.
The elected will follow the execution with moderation.
I can't do that.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with the man, because we've been on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison staff say that I cannot be present as both a witness and a reporter, so I cannot bring a notebook and a pen to take notes.
I just need to try and get the details in my head.
A reporter in Oklahoma accused me of compromising neutrality on Twitter.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell the condemned story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him".
I told the reporter I had a difference of opinion.
The clerk admitted that he could have spoken more carefully, but he still felt that my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't dictate what I write, and even if he tried to dictate, I wouldn't obey.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international reporter to report on what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will promote the death penalty movement.
I'm having a meeting with Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I'm not going to go into detail about this.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would make him guilty of aiding and abetting a crime.
However, I believe it is highly likely that Mr. Glossip was not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence was insufficient to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his execution.
I can't say I'm completely impartial.
The neutral description can be read in other news stories.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die for nothing.
A man was lured to the Canning River after a water police chase.
The Canning Valley field officer was kept dry when he pulled a man up the Canning River.
A Perth man's escape attempt plunged him into a low, muddy water, and a few feet away a police officer brought the man back to dry land.
Canning Vale police received a call Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they spotted a suspect who was trying to punish the police by directing Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"A man standing in the water announced that he was not coming out of the water and urged the police to get him in the water", said senior Lt. Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia was not attracted to the wetsuit, so he chose a safer tactic than negotiation.
"Sometimes an escape attempt makes a person resort to amusing means", said Lieutenant Castledine.
The case of football manager Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid police blowout and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the plot inspired the locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says the reporters tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to stop the competition.
Peter Moody is accusing Racing Victoria's editors of spying on their tailings last year, and the man threatened to stop racing immediately.
Moody claims that the editors and Racing Victoria's non-compliance department have attacked him personally, and that the recent rejection of Lady Tata for racing day treatment was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always been committed to racing, and that Moody's been in a difficult situation when a cobalt was found in Lidar's sample, and he couldn't explain the finding.
Moody's been keeping his tongue shut about the spy charges for a year and a half and didn't want the charges to seem like a bitter man's act.
"I didn't mean to bring it up, I've been thinking about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration just comes out of the gutter", Moody said.
"They know what really happened".
"Sometimes you have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the situation after I open my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk upright, and I want the horse owners to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe that, I don't think I should continue as a horse trainer.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach".
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told the nonprofit about the espionage efforts at his barn.
"Two and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart were sitting in the same room and offered a job to a man in my barn to spy on my actions.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present evidence, because I've never been caught without permission.
Former President Robert Roulston of the RVL, current President David Moodie of the RVL and current CEO Bernard Saundry of the RVL were aware of the activities then and now.
Should I take this as a personal drive?
Should the RVL take real action and hold the industry accountable to anyone other than the coaches?
Am I a threat to the industry?
Am I really a threat to the industry?
Maybe that's what many people think.
I'm sure I'll get a license to coach and be pushed out of my job, and I'm sure I'll get a lot of people to think that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pressuring them to make their decision.
My family is with me, and I can retire".
Lidar's long-standing investigation into his cobalt values and his recent rejection caused the coach to become so frustrated that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the undefeated Black Caviar, a man who made fun of the race day after a steering wheel was placed against the rules on the horse's legs.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that", Moody said.
"A person on my staff mistakenly put mud on the horse's leg.
We could have done the savi treatment last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and it was.
But it was on race day".
Moodya can expect a three-month ban on illegal clay treatment, which the organizers have begun to address.
"This is a joke.
The rules were made by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone knows that rules are needed, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
Arrested fugitive from the Cobram crash site
Police have arrested a man who ran away from the crash site after a weekend collision with a cyclist.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he was seriously injured when he was hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the man who drove the car escaped the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to Shepparton police.
He is likely to face charges of failure to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is referring to the opponents' speeches.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has said that criticism of the team's away game is a deliberate act on both sides of the NRL.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave the Storm a pair of scissors in a win-loss match against the hosts of Melbourne on Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett has been trying to cover up a reference to the Storm after the Broncos defeated the Queensland Cowboys in the quarterfinals on Saturday night, calling the game a modeling game, saying that Queensland doesn't care about pressure in particular.
Bellamy defended his own team's cover game and said they were just focused on contact when they were tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was enhanced by the fact that the two top-ranked coaches criticized his team, which Bellamy sees as a sign that the coaches are worried about losing to the Storm.
"This is always coming up, and as far as I can remember Trent Robinson didn't say anything about pressure when his team beat us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or our technology in the whole year, but for the past six weeks, we've just been investing in contact games and suppressors, which has turned us upside down.
Trent's been on the job for three years, and losing might have been a shock to him because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny how the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett about what was interesting about football, and he reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne is talking about an interesting football game.
He compared his team's game on Saturday to our game on Friday and found their game interesting", Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George received a lot of criticism for his boring game, and Wayne said that the criticism didn't bother him for a moment.
Now he has a team that can play what's called football, especially his young, fast-paced center-forward.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you have a player's arsenal like this.
He stressed this in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play his style, and not all teams have center-forwards like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence from this when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they're going to resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us at the big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the Storm and Rooster games were more painted than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos were probably a good game, but I haven't seen it, but what was the score?
We had a lot more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are gambling and small business football interesting?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably come to them".
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will have a chance to visit either the North Queensland Cowboys Cronus or the Sharks next Saturday at AAMI Park.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for the possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a 100-pound cocaine ship, the Solay, that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived in Coomera harbor in August.
Police observed Maximovic and his partner meeting at the ferry terminal in the morning and surprised the two later at the Coomera Roadhouse coffee shop.
While Maksimović is expected to face life imprisonment for possession of the drug for commercial purposes, according to the man's lawyer, there is no evidence that his agent attempted to take possession of the entire batch, but the man may have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to flee the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived".
Maximovic's mother and stepfather paid a combined $200,000 bail, which was later released.
"After reading the probate papers of both individuals, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
"But that alone is not enough to stop the man from escaping", the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on the condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and stay home from evening till morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl 's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures .
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get hold of pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was asleep and signed up for an online messaging service where he had another user send him inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, when she woke up, she found the phone missing, and she found it asleep in Hogg's hand.
While browsing the contents of her phone, she found disturbing messages and immediately told her mother.
After investigating the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches that used search terms to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he had tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and to present the police in order to scare pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidation.
He admitted to having made the computer burial, but claimed to have done so to present the police and thus to intimidate pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent him the pictures and who Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his intention was to mislead pedophiles.
She said that she had troubled thoughts while drinking and that she wanted to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "After receiving the messages from the phone, the girl shouted at her mother, trembling and crying".
She saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the defendant used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked significantly younger than her.
Hogg, 23, of Dundee Ward Road, pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography offences on June 14 last year, violated his probation on January 25 this year and was disqualified from appearing for an arraignment hearing on March 24 this year.
Attorney Gregor Sim asked Hoggia not to be placed on the sex offender registry, as it could be seen that the crime did not contain any significant sexual traits.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentencing to October due to reports of background work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was detained under investigation on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offender registry before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe is giving a false speech in parliament
Africa's oldest head of state, Mugabe, fell down the stairs leading to a speech disorder earlier this year.
Mugabe was not hurt, but the video of what happened quickly spread on social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also overshadowed by the opposition lawmakers' claims that they had received unnamed death threats warning them not to bow to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the parliamentarians interrupted the President's State of the Union address in Parliament with a loud voice, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a bishop in the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message was sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer in the immunity zone.
The party's bishop said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is concerned about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings operations.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and separate the computer and printing business from the fastest growing enterprise hardware and services business.
According to HP, the company will record one-time expenses of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter onwards.
"The restructuring will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP's CEO, who will lead the company after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller, more focused company than HP today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies move to a new business model", Whitman said.
"As a company, we are better than ever and better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world".
Hewlett Packard Enterprises has annual sales of over $50 billion and is focused on providing unique integrated technology solutions to businesses.
The company, founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s, who raised Stanford University, is now divided into two companies, the twin founding an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, now considered the birthplace of Hidden Valley.
HP has undergone massive restructuring as it moves from traditional desktop to mobile.
The changes at HP, the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest shift in the industry where focus is believed to bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before they face Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also insisted on Wilsher that it's not until September, and if everything goes well with the recovery plan, there's no reason why he can't return to the field by December.
The best possible scenario is that Wilshere will be forced to miss at least the next four games for England, and his involvement in European competitions is clearly unclear.
The biggest disgrace of the last problem is that Wilshere ended last season strongly after a knee injury and seemed to be back to his old steel in the new season.
"This kind of injury is not a career threat", Wenger said.
"The leather did not heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries".
Well, it may be medical, but as Wenger said, more injuries can occur when a player tries to get back on the field in the middle of the season.
There is also a noticeable unpleasantness in this.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different cases since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in only 65 league games for Arsenal in total over the last five seasons.
The bigger picture for Arsenal is that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been the second most injured team to lose money.
Wenger accepts a possible spell, but Arsenal believes the improvement in injury statistics over the past season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes, a vulnerable period of recovery after injury can involve strengthening the body and seeking competitive advantage", Wenger said.
"Jack is young, so he's gonna get through this.
I hope he gets his body back on track, and I believe in that, and that will continue his career as he deserves".
Arsenal will begin their Champions League career on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be starters.
Wenger may also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the starting line-up with Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the team balanced and give rest to those who need it", Wenger said.
While Arsenal is clearly the favourite to follow up F, Maxim Zagreb is one of the most feared stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated in 41 games for the team.
The stadium was hit Tuesday night when the earth was waving at a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This is the tenth earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's falling into the hands of Monaco and is still motivated by a long-standing desire to rely on the team for a European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge", Wenger said.
"Arsenal have yet to win this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realistic with my experience.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers".
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about male friendship
This is a similar description that is reflected in the absence of other series, and it is worth noting, especially considering that men are more open than ever and that the suicide rate among young men is at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, with suicide three times more common in men than women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 the Year of Men, challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed, and the study found that those with depression have a better chance of recovery when they are surrounded by healthy people.
Also, the likelihood of illness in the symptomless population was halved if they were surrounded by people who did not have mental health problems.
But the foundation of all this is friendship.
Today's communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content, and quick feedback is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitisation of life, the need to seem strong, fun and successful has doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The outward values associated with material success, money, image, and social standing, all of which draw attention to inner values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship, inner values that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A video game billionaire recently stated that money cannot really buy happiness.
The great thing about Frendi was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession, but by personality, and that was evident in friendships.
And the show was humorously about Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs, and we also saw Ross often missing Rachel, and it was obvious that men were able to identify with this, even though they didn't stop knowing it completely.
One volunteer explained to me: "Listening to depressed and suicidal people has made me realize how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
The men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be successful is strong, and it's easy to think of a man as weak when he talks about his problems".
"Frendit is one of those series that shows long-term survival mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
I can offer help by telephone from outside in times of despair, but long-term support comes from friends and family in the local area".
Comedy Central's FriendsFest has brought the series to life, so if you're attending this weekend, you might want to take your friends to Central Perth for a coffee.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central is broadcasting the entire Frendit series  all 236 episodes  in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's shot helped PSG defeat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan for the goal against Malmö.
Di Maria made his Champions League debut in a friendly match and helped PSG beat Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and the rating.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the spotlight when Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League career by beating Malmö's Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal after less than four minutes of the first leg, and he secured the French championship position with a quick handshake, but PSG scored several goals before they were finally able to increase their lead: Cavani scored after 60 minutes.
The A-League also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the champion of Sweden.
Although SPG scored, the match was not a complete performance for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place of goalkeeper and the man was replaced when he faced his former home team, where he started his career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win and good grades provide a good basis, even though we still have a disappointing season to go", Blanc said.
"This is good.
We were thirsty for the win and we were able to do it, but it's a shame we couldn't do one or two more".
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after an injury, and the team had to settle for a 2-2 draw in Ligue 1 against Bordeaux on the weekend.
The Argentine forward, who joined PSG from Manchester United last month, was named PSG's referee to take the team to a new level in Europe, proving himself worthy of the title by throwing the ball over Malmö's defence after Marco Verratt's delivery and then finishing the shot at the back of the net, passing Johan Wiland.
However, those who had been waiting for PSG's breakthrough were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the losing games, marched nine international players to the field from the start.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot passed Kevin Trapp's goal from the back of the net in the 34th minute of the game, and the team didn't attack very actively.
Instead, PSG rushed to a pointless pitch and a weak finish, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his lead in the penalty shoot-out, with Di Maria shooting the spinster past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal came in the county due to Cavan, who was playing through the sixth, and the Uruguayan shot a full-back when Ibrahimovic kicked him out of the left-sided forward Maxwell.
The ball ended in the second goal, and only Wiland's top line from near David Luiz's range to shoot the shot kept the readings in check, and Ezequiel Lavezz's goal from the bench was abandoned in the final meters.
The club's founder Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in a class of its own. "We played the previous Champions League game last December.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
The punches aren't enough.
A hat for the Parisians.
They thought it was a great game".
Glencore is raising $2.5 billion in equity loans.
The Swiss mining company Glencore, which is undergoing a price drops in raw materials, raised $2.5 billion in equity on Wednesday as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth around £1.6 billion to reduce debt.
The company's market value declined by 57% this year, and it has been hit hard by the drop in raw material prices as the Chinese economic downturn hampers demand and weighs on the market.
With the share price, Glencore's stock price hit the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share increased by 2,77% to 131,60 pence in the FTSE 100 Index, opening up to a rise of 0,69%.
Glencore announced last week that it plans to raise $2.5 billion in equity loans as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders for 125 pence, a decrease of 2.4% on Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares, totalling up to 9,99% of the total group.
Concern over the continuation of the Chinese recession has caused the price of iron ore to fall by half, while the price of coal, copper and other commodities has fallen by 2040%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
A White House statement on Tuesday confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping will be on a state visit to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will arrive in Washington on September 25 for his first official visit, a counter-visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
After bilateral talks between the heads of state, the President of the United States and the wife of the President, Michelle Obama, will host a dinner in honor of a state visit to Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues of disagreement", the White House said in a statement.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February and he is expected to make a visit to Seattle to meet several US tech leaders.
Obama and Xin are expected to address a number of controversial topics, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased efforts in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon is downplaying the diversity of filmmaking.
Matt Damon had a very intense conversation with African-American Effie Brown and concluded that diversity is not needed behind the camera.
In an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight on Sunday night, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he explained the importance of taking into account the different views of the dark protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"Multi-talent is considered in the film, not the show", Damon claimed.
Brown nodded shocked and hurt at the allegation. "Wow, that's clear", said the woman after Damon, who starred in the film Alone on Mars, made a comment.
Damon and Brown had met with the brothers of other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly, to discuss the finalists.
"Whoever's the director, I'd like to encourage you to think about how to play the character of Harmon", Brown said at the beginning.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with a white partner".
The producer of Dear White People backed Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors, and Damon responded with a bit of a sneer that choosing a pair could lead to an unintended outcome.
When the conversation was televised, social media exploded with Damon's nasty comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in the following words: "The fact that Matt Damon is talking to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white that it hurts".
The tweet was shared over 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the media's fair representation of the human race is the main topic.
After teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by white police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national support as it seeks to end discrimination against black lawmakers and officials.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the release of the Grammy Award nominees for Album of the Year.
"Albums still matter", he said.
"Like books and the lives of the dark, albums still matter".
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fow News' Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be classified as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love-based group", said the movement's leader.
Damon is one of the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to the pope's office to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if Damon answered yes to the invitation.
The first winner of the American Ninja Warrior series
Professional mirror and dish collector Isaac Caldiero took home his first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and was awarded a million dollars in prize money.
In the seventh season of the TV series, all the assignments were clarified for the first time.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
The last task was for men to pull a 20-foot rope up in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task in the time allotted to him, and he was the first competitor to complete the fourth round of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero did it three seconds faster and emerged as the winner.
Caldiero told E!News that after a hard-fought battle, he was still in shock after catching a million-dollar pot.
"The amount of winnings is incredible because I've never made more than $10,000 a year", he told E! in an interview about his jackpot.
"All of a sudden, I can't even imagine what the future holds".
The corresponding producer, Kent Weed, told The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britain won't be awarded, even though he was the first contestant to have solved all the missions.
"The rules say the fastest winner is the prize money.
If more than one competitor gets all the tasks done, the fastest winner", Weed explained.
"A cash prize is a wonderful and life-changing experience, but Britten also gets satisfaction from her performance.
I don't think he'll be here to bury the matter any longer.
He's just happy with what he's done.
He's been praised by fans for his part.
Britten is a great guy who cares about family.
His children and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win himself, he preferred to call Isaac the winner.
She also believes that Isaac would have thought the same of her if the situation had been different".
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have squeezed a win over the Minnesota Twins .
The Detroit Tigers have not had a particularly pleasant experience in the second half of the season.
The Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, are now in last place in the American League Central.
However, the team did manage to beat the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to get up to the Houston Astros to feel like they're fighting another wild card drop-off.
Detroit returned, even for one night, to a taste of victory that has been beyond stone in the second half of the season.
"Any win is nice, no matter how it's achieved", said Tigers pitcher Brad Ausmus.
Tigers catcher Alfredo Simon held his own as Detroit made it three times in the first two rounds, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three earned runs.
He's only gotten three good starts in nine innings.
"I just want to end the season strong this year", Simon said.
"It's hard to throw a substitute every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth".
Tigers quarterback Victor Martinez had three hits and two runs, his first since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since hitting four home runs against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well", Ausmus said.
"He looks good in punching practice and kept his pace in the game".
In the bottom of the seventh, the Twins had the best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started the turn by hitting two nests near the left sidebar with a punch.
Right-handed pitcher Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice run, and Simon took second place to Brian Dozier, who took three straight innings before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy was given a free pass to Mauer, and the next-to-last pitcher, Miguel Sano, hit two home runs, and right-hander Drew Verhagen followed.
When there were two runners on the field, VerHagen had Trevor Plouffen, the third, burn two players.
Major League team led for the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit had hit the nine-run margin in the first inning, Tigers quarterback Bruce Rondon hit two runs, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight innings and was able to keep his team in position.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes being a little rusty.
The Tigers had three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed hitter who had just returned from the injured list, a man who had been sidelined for a month with a back infection.
"Of course, the start was not what I had hoped for, but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable, and I was able to perform well and make a few good shots in the third inning", Hughes said.
After taking the lead, Hughes gave a one-run home run to second baseman Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The right-hander, J.D. Martinez, the free kick, brought Victor Martinez to the first inning of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 pipe broke when the team had players on the bench.
Nick Castellanos, third, got one hit in the nest, one run, but Victor Martinez burned trying to get to third.
The Tigers increased their lead in the second inning, with James McCann surviving the second and Anthony Gose the first, with a score of 3-0.
"It was a big hit", said Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit very well, but the punch hit the right spot".
Hughes was in the lineup, feeding a scoreless third round, then being traded to right-handed replacement A.J. Achter.
Hughes's best result came with three runs, six hits, a free throw and four straight innings.
Note: Tigers right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not in the lineup due to a torn ACL.
The shoulder is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list for a shoulder injury since mid-August, and he was scheduled to join Wednesday.
When Sanchez is not playing, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris will be removed from the injured list and will be in the starting lineup against the Twins.
Norris has scored 1 1 in four games since being traded to left-handed hitter David Price on July 30.
He's been out of the lineup since August 20th because of a ruptured abdominal cavity.
The Tigers and Twins are wrapping up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average of 4.43) is being replied by right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana of Minnesota (5-4, running average of 4.73).
Xi urges the economy to open up to the rest of the world
"The economic system must open up to the rest of the world to promote growth", President Xi Jinping said Tuesday at the Steering Committee for Economic Reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and develop an economic opening policy", the President said at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee set up to deepen comprehensive reform.
"By promoting an open policy and deepening reforms, a new leap forward and a new vitality for economic growth will be restored", Xi said.
The Governing Body adopted guidelines including a negative list setting out market access, easing border control policies, promoting the convergence of private capital into state-owned enterprises and revising the citizens' registration system.
The Communication states that a negative list of sectors and companies in which investments are prohibited is to be drawn up.
The system will be tested in stages and developed using test programmes.
The Communication states that this is a significant change, as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, in the legal business environment and in the opening up of the market.
The government is also relaxing the supervision of companies and thus wants to ensure that companies have the right to decide on their own business.
The Communication states that China will allow the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border areas and the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
The opening up of the public sector opens up many sectors to private investment.
'The Government will not change its foreign investment policy, it will support the legitimate interests of foreign-funded enterprises and provide them with better services,' the statement said.
In addition, the application for a permanent residence permit shall be made by optimising the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the right of lawyers to practise and the support of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
