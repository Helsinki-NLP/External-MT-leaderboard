below them are more medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to squirrels and canids.
Finally, there are many small-sized cats (including feral cats) that eat more small prey such as insects, mice, sparrows and birds.
The secret to their successwas the concept of a niche, a specific task for each cat that prevents it from competing with other cats.
Leos are the most social of cats, and they live in large groups called "lion packs".
The lion's den is made up of one to three adult males, along with 30 females and their young.
Women are always close to each other, because they're a big family of sisters and daughters.
Prides Lion behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, the predatory animal behaves like a lion (but not a big cat) and is also extremely dangerous to its prey.
Ready to attack, tigers can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the star tiger, and the jaguar. Only these four cats can bark.
tiger's scent is not like a lion's roar, more like a string of crooked words, a scream of words.
The oselot tiger is a predator of small animals. It will catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if it can. Most of the animals it preys on are much smaller than its size.
The Oselot tiger is thought to track and hunt prey by sniffing the ground it has passed.
Ocelot uses night vision to see well, and also moves slowly. Ocelot hunts its prey by hiding in environments that resemble its own body color and then stalking its prey.
When a small group of organisms (small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g. if they migrate across mountains or rivers, or if they migrate to new islands so that they cannot relocate easily) they often end up in a different environment than before.
This new environment has diverse resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The natives have not changed at all, they still need adaptation as before.
n ae n ae time, as new inhabitants begin to adjust to their new surroundings, they begin to look less and less like other inhabitants.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they are no longer of the same species.
we call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. speciation is an inevitable consequence and an essential part of evolution.

Although most of their food is familiar, the Romans also had a strange or bizarre diet, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rat called a dormouse.
Another difference is that whereas poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men preferred to make a meal together where they would relax by their side while they ate their food.

THE CULTURES
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congressional power does not apply to taxes and, since there is no national judicial executive, it relies on state power, which is often non-cooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also has no right to veto interstate tax and tariff laws.
The article required the consent of all districts before they could amend and districts took the central government as light as their representatives were often absent.

For example, the most common image in the fortographic format in the world is 35mm, which was equivalent to the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
still being produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the digital camera image detection format.
35mm is actually a bit confusing, 36mm wide times 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. formats from the APS family) are equal to or nearly equal to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and misunderstood rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining orderly dimensions in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between lines that divide the image into three vertically and transversely (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very rich and powerful, began to be questioned.

The power of absolute power affects everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and misery and the church's financial endowment is specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and the power and money have caused many to question whether this belief has been fulfilled.
n shortly after the battle, the British began a blockade of the German navy.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although these restrictions did not comply with the generally accepted international law enshrined in several international treaties two centuries ago.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean, causing danger to even ordinary ships.

The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad SAW was very interested in this thing beyond ordinary life. He often visited a cave later known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) to think.
he's self-deprecating, persistent all the time, giving a very clear image of the spiritual tendencies of Muhammad.
Situated on top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.

Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to several pyramids (among them the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wife and family members of Khufu.

Up means you should start at the end and push the bow, and down means, you should start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up usually produces a softer sound whereas a down-bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You are free to write your own notes, but please remember that the printed notes are there for musical purposes, so they should always be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Empress Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a group of women in the market.
On horseback, they returned to Paris and were surrounded by a mob who were screaming and shouting threatening the King and Queen.
The mob has forced the King and Queen to open wide their windows.

To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that has triggered the formation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred is generally known as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).


THE DETERMINISM OF TECHNOLOGY
For example, one might say that motorized vehicles led to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country was not viable for just a few cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The high level of car ownership has also led to an increase in road accidents which has led to the creation of new techniques in health care to restore injured body parts.
Romantism has a large element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.

Self-farming is farming that is done to produce food for the needs of the farmer and their outgoings.
Self-fertilizer is a simple system, often organic, that uses stored seeds that come from a single ecological area and combines with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in agriculture as a means of livelihood, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel they are being ignored by society's standards and allows them to develop their identity.
Subculture can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that define different cultural branches may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual politics, geography or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular cultural branch often display their membership through certain styles symbolically, whether in the form of fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to describe the importance of socialization is to take into account some unfortunate cases of children being neglected, miserable, or intentionally abused, not socializing with adults when they are older.
feral or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases this neglect of the child is due to the parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
The feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or on the run.
Other children are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to live alone in the woods.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child will exhibit behaviour (in physical terms) almost entirely like the animal that cares for it, such as a fearful or indifferent nature towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, the framework provides more than that.
Scale is not a means to learning but rather an aid which supports individuals in experiencing new learning experiences such as using new computer programs or starting new projects.
Scaffolding can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a scaffolding and so is a little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
The Maya Sketchboard is integrated into the software and acts to question, assist, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to handle on his or her own.
children are placed with foster families for various reasons including neglect, abuse and also for the purpose of blackmail.
No child should be raised in a carefree, careless, educated environment, but they do.
We see the Maintenance System as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The childcare system should provide for all the needs that cannot be provided in the home where the child is taken.
Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to an additional dimension in terms of approach to consumption and satisfaction.
learning andsocial have been proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al, 1995).
Personal engagement andsustained relationship have been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President Speaks, shows how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess honesty.
He suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century studies have shown that there are two types of groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Genetic mutation additions and selection remove from the set of prominent changes.
Isolation and re-merger reshaped the variation between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human to meet the amino acid requirements from the existing plant sources.

The easiest plant source is protein found in leaves and nuts, but these are hard to digest by primates like us unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (anthills, ants, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but it provides high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep for a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a silent alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.

Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, an unknown diuretic) before bed, forcing a person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of calmness a person has has an opposite correlation to the amount of tension a person has in his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the spirit of life. Everyone has the potential to find true peace and contentment.
nse pode alcançar a consciencia, e a única coisa que impede esta metaé o nosso próprio stress e negatividade.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddhism, but has been extended by the Mahayana love path and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Buddhism has a very simple principle. consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love.
Kundalini (awareness energy) is triggered by Kundalini Yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. It depicts various gods clearing the energy channels, activating the chakras and creating inner awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during WWII which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures had divided the two countries.
2 years after the war ended, the former allies are now enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It will last for the next 40 years and be fought in the flesh by proxy armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
n 17hb September, 1939, Polish defenses had been destroyed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
The plans were obsolete in the process, however, after 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the lines of Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aligned Movement, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.

Traditionally, the Navy's job was to make sure your country maintained its ability to move people and goods, while disrupting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
one of the most famous recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.

Domestic goats were generally kept in herds grazing on hills or other pastures, often guarded by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherds today.

Though the chariot's track was made up of only parallel wooden boards, it allowed the horse to pull it to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than the rougher roads of the time.
The cross-linking was introduced rather early to hold the local track. However, it was realized that the track would be more efficient if it had an iron strip on top.

The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
It is not a stand-alone, experimentation and experimentation are tests used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on the classical text and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotelis's commentaries have been accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the Western world found themselves stopped from learning the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are usually highly dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Physical pulse, which is not just a response to periodic external signals, has been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clock is a self-swinging oscillator that will continue to cycle freely even without any external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used faj, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two tests that marked whether DNA was in phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
mutations have a wide range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.

Everyone participates in the association and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In the developed world, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why is the transport system causing such complaints, why is it failing every day? Is it because of inefficient transport engineers? Or is there something wrong at the basic level?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is difficult because driver behavior is not predictable 100%
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner; thus, traffic flows are also fairly consistent and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be taken into the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back to the side of the body.
This gives them a wide area small places to hide from predators.

Aristóteles, philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is made of a mixture of four or more elements. earth, water, wind and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it's also theorized that they change into new material to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.

The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to combine the nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
like pulling a heavyweight to the top of a hill, splitting the nucleus once more and then releasing a little bit of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei which means they can be separated with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the Earth's crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the high ground.

Content theory is about finding out what makes people tick or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are confirmed when they reach maturity as adults.
These theories look at what's inside a person that makes them want the things they want and the things in their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
On the one hand, there are two behaviors that can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues. On the other hand, there are two behaviors that arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues. On the other hand, there are two behaviors that arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues. On the other hand, there are two behaviors that arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues. On the other hand, there are two behaviors that arise when managers try to stay in the old gang of friends.
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, implementing organized actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one will turn into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything the team has done and give his personal touch.
After all, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This behavior often causes conflict between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but the differences are negligible.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for physical groups in close proximity.
They typically have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of an unseen team is also a unique component of virtual teams (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
Team invisible
Why would an organisation want to engage in the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One goal for implementing the concept of organisational learning is innovation.
n when all resources are effectively utilized across every functional part of an organization, creativity and intelligence can occur.
As a result, the processes of organizations working together to overcome barriers can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and the sharing of knowledge and learning within the organisation.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognition research. It thus refines the field of research making it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior has helped scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury and tumor affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The existence of new technologies has allowed us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer answers and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like this have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields, as they have been built into some home computer and video game software applications.
Tours are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take his students to places that cannot be visited by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual tours where students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums or admire beautiful art from the classroom.
