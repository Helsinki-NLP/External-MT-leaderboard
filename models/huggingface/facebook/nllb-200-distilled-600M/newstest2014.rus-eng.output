Two men committed suicide in Kineshme and the district
One of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, around 1 a.m., a 1947 man committed suicide by hanging himself in the village of Lugovoye.
It is known that he has attempted suicide before.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man from Kineshma committed suicide by hanging himself.
No signs of violent death have been found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kinechemsky" reports.
You got a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to raise money to repair a decaying highway system, many begin to see the solution in a small black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile a driver travels and transmit this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial effort to modernize America's outdated highway financing system, undertaken by Washington and state planning authorities.
The often boring arena of highway planning has unexpectedly spawned intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small boxes to track how many miles you travel and maybe even where you travel -- and then use that information to make tax returns.
The tea movement in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to continue or not, several states aren't going to wait.
They're thinking about how, over the next decade, we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have satellite tracking capabilities.
It's really necessary for our country.
"This is not a question we can have a choice about", said Hassan Ihrat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is planning to begin monitoring the miles driven by every California driver by 2025.
There will be changes in the way we pay these taxes.
We already have the technology.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funding from the Government Highway Fund, which is funded by taxes Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars go more than a mile a gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't been raised in 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise taxes even by a penny with high gas prices.
"It's just impossible to save a gas tax", said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 tracking devices on cars to test the default payment system.
"It's going to be the best alternative in the long run", he said.
The Zanudians call it a pardoned user fee.
It's no wonder this idea is attracting urban liberals, because with taxes, you can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planning agencies in California are assigned to this system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set by the state's ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, House member Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market advocates at the Reason Foundation are also excited about driving for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go to a black hole", said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transportation ministers who in 2011 called on Congress to move toward a pardon.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot last year that would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who often have to travel many miles to get to work or the city in their daily lives.
Several states and cities, however, are going this route on their own.
The state of Oregon is the most enthusiastic, with 5,000 drivers being drawn to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for miles of running instead of gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot is already complete.
He's being considered in New York.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with truckers.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transportation departments in 17 states along the east coast, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida, is looking at how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government might be monitoring their every move.
"Fear about big brother and stuff like that is a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, chief strategy and efficiency officer at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were in full swing, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website that it would be easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of everyday movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states where the search for cheap technology is hard to do, which would allow the state to keep track of miles driven, but without any information about the time and place.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not involved in assisting the state in tax collection.
It sought to enter the emerging market for a type of auto insurance where drivers pay based on the race.
But the devices she's testing are attracting road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that's periodically uploaded by modem.
"People will be more likely to do that if you don't track their speed and location", said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There were a few big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.
There are far less expensive and less compulsive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing different options to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can just drop the device altogether and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage that all residents of the state travel.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a vigilant public by making devices do more, not less.
In New York, transportation officials are working on a tax system that will also accept parking meter payments, provide insurance-like payments, and collect real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
Automobile drivers will be attracted to the benefits they will be offered,  says the city planning document.
Some transportation system designers, however, wonder if all talk of a default payment is just a huge distraction.
Officials at the San Francisco Bay Area Transportation Commission say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for Highway Construction by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax would be charged to drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use much gasoline to pay their fair share.
"There's no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin", said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares support measures for Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan to supply Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on emergency credit, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official, directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to reach an agreement soon.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome longstanding differences over financing conditions.
Not believing in the possibility of reforms needed to get help, and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step - to "B-" with "B".
However, EU officials say the IMF can show flexibility in lending conditions, taking into account the circumstances in Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to supply Ukraine with gas, most of which now comes from Russia.
It could be gas from the North Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, officials say, is the most likely and acceptable way in case Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this way of reversing supplies to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"Through EU countries and Ukrainians, negotiations are underway on how to create favorable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on different routes", the source added.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transportation problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the 20th century.
The main concerns were either the re-development and expansion of motorways or the attempts to reduce demand for motor vehicles, the number of cars and the time spent driving them.
Singapore is a well-known example, where private cars are subject to strict quotas, and the right to buy them is bought at auctions.
It can cost two or three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only vehicles with a certain eco-class, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles) are allowed to enter.
Beijing's Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" in 2012 worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As reported by "Ъ" Director of Transport Pollution Control of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Li Kunsheng, the five-year goal is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase fuel consumption by no more than 5% per vehicle.
According to the agency, now, Beijing's transportation is responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
The program's main measures include limiting the use of automobile transport, as well as introducing additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year plan" include accelerated transition to the eurofuel standards compared to the rest of the country, introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuel, restriction of the entry of cars into the central part of the city, prohibition on the use of obsolete transportation (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs to replace old cars with hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars moving within the fifth transport ring (there are six in the capital of China) one day a week (appropriate information is contained in the vehicle number sign), as well as the issuance of registration marks for cars based on lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for private cars in Beijing was only one-third of the number of 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011, "moving sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than those from industry, and in St. Petersburg, nine times higher.
In Russia, the possibility of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities is only beginning to be considered.
The director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at VSE, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel are not popular, and can only be accepted by society if they are universally accepted.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem arises with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of vulnerable to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as "privileged" users' cars, whose total number is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of fleet in Moscow).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM Center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, road coverage and the number of cars.
The main findings of the researchers are that the city center is twice as well-paved as the city center, and most of the drivers living in the city center don't use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the passage (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the historic center's protection zone (a total area of about 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for street trafficking in Vologda will increase
According to the city authorities, increasing the fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and locks.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell often go unchecked.
That means the health of the people of the region is at risk.
The lower limit of fines for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Volodymyr Administration reports.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the main driver of Russia's fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of unsecured consumer credit default swaps and massive cuts in staff.
Our main concern now is not that growth is slowing, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is completely driven by consumption, which almost does not reduce turnover", said Clemens Graf, Goldman Sachs' chief economist for Russia, presenting the investment bank's quarterly report on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
At 6% inflation, it will be able to meet future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they will most likely be looking to optimize their personnel spending.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, Mr Graf explained.
Companies have been facing a decline in profitability.
If it doesn't grow, it could lead to job losses and higher unemployment.
Russian businesses cannot not raise wages, commented Barclays Capital's chief economist for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment is near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
To attract employees from outside or keep current ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by a very rapid growth in consumer lending.
Mr Graf believes that because of the extremely high consumer loan rates, this type of lending has no multiplier effect on the country's economy.
"We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, money is not spent on the economy, but is returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments", said the economist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs expects to see a surge in default loans.
They're mostly taken by the poor, who have nothing to provide.
The interest rates on these loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often", Mr Graf said.
Therefore, the second threat to Russia's economic growth is the possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured loans.
The director of the Banking Institute of the HSE, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, without access to cheap resources such as those of state banks, were forced to attract the population at high interest rates.
In response, state banks have been on the warpath and have been lowering credit rates, the economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not refuse to dump, Russia is in danger of a full-fledged banking crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
The banking license loss of a number of banks in recent weeks is seen by economists as a sign of a mass collapse.
"The state banks themselves cannot cope with this situation: the system of insurance of deposits was not originally designed for a systemic crisis", warns the head of the institute.
But the growth of consumption will slow down even without a default crisis, the investment bank believes, because of the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and military personnel, as laid down in the current version of the budget.
The impact on consumption will be partially mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by lowering inflation).
But only partially: if investment doesn't grow (and there's no basis for that yet - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital doesn't see the preconditions for the realization of pessimistic scenarios yet.
"The main risk is the continued drop in oil prices", he says.
He estimates that Russia's economy will begin to shrink when oil prices fall below $90 a barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank has not yet been able to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is that inflation has fallen, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This could mean that they didn't believe the central bank that announced the move to target inflation", Clemens Graf said.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank, it's a breakdown of all hope", Clemens said.
The money raised at the central bank's auctions is not used by banks to lend the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate falls, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later the Central Bank will realize that this strategy does not work", Mr Graf said, reminding that the state plans to release the ruble into "free circulation" by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to be done sooner or the central bank will have to raise the key rate (5.5%), he says.
According to his estimate, the ruble is now artificially over 10%.
I only cut one path - to weaken", concludes the expert.
But if the Central Bank casts a shadow of a doubt on the financials that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the ruble's weakening policy, it could bring the ruble down much more.
The Second Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Ural was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of People's Unity, 400 years of the restoration of Russian statehood and 20 years of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive authorities took part in the congress - a total of about 350 people.
The forum's aim is to strengthen the interethnic harmony.
We can set an example not only for other regions, but for other countries.
We have no differences.
We live in complete understanding", says the Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoustsky.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including patriotism, cultural cooperation.
The resolution was adopted at the end of the congress.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
The exhibition of the national cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany on a matter related to U.S. intelligence.
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence informant, has said he is ready to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to answer questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, it said: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that provide no defence".
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the international community's support could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peters Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible".
Relations between the United States and Germany have become strained after allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Operman, the deputy who heads the parliamentary group overseeing intelligence, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness without endangering him or completely destroying relations with the United States, it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Green Party MP, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strobel said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there safely, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a fierce and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was inspired by the global response to his political statements.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials  including in the United States  have found exposing the uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance to be beneficial to society.
The letter contains an offer to cooperate with the German authorities when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said passengers will be able to keep the entire bank.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25, if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers only pay when they get to the exit.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers take care of paying in advance.
"We don't want to charge for this", she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags handed over to the luggage in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges load as much as they can into the hand luggage that is placed in the upper luggage compartments, which often makes the compartments empty.
Charges are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new fee isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say it's getting harder to find a place in the upper luggage compartments.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the exit of the Frontier flight can take the bag for free, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change in procedures on the Frontier website and registration booths is designed to ensure that passengers will know about the charge before they get to the boarding gate.
The new Frontier hand-held goods charge won't start until summer, although the date hasn't been set yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They say that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the increased baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of flights after years of losses.
However, most of them were not related to the collection of hand-held goods.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand luggage charge three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discount later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
According to his December 2011 report, the collection of hand-held treasure brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was curious what he would find at the exit when passengers encountered an unusual charge of Spirit for hand luggage.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've seen in my career in airlines", he said.
I expected to see a toothbrush and a fight on the way out.
The plane was full, he said, and the landing was quick.
Frontier also follows Spirit in terms of a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive a soda or juice can keep the entire can and that a portion of the coffee will be provided free of charge.
She'll still be giving out free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused seven months later after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
The Frontier initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest step in attracting customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to go to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone beyond all else in this area.
In September, it began giving twice as many bonus miles of frequent flyer to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the mile premium to 25 percent of the mile.
So a 1,000-mile journey from Frontier, bought from an online travel agency, would get you 250 miles.
Passengers can also choose seats in advance only if they purchase tickets directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming disadvantaged.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight opportunities fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline sale.
The NSA blames internal error, not hackers for the website shutdown.
The National Security Agency said on Friday night that the shutdown of their website for several hours was caused by a technical failure, not by hackers, as the network claimed.
NSA.gov was inaccessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update, the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
An NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network was not compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the representative said.
At least one online hacker group of activists claimed responsibility for disabling the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site goes down.
The hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly top-secret NSA, once nicknamed "No Such Agency", has been the focus of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months after a string of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and domestically, all in response to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by disappointed former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has prompted speculation that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier 's profits are falling with the drop in deliveries and orders for aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by declining aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any data on flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial service by next September would be met.
After the first test flight of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions about whether the test phase is progressing on schedule.
The results didn't live up to the expectations and led to a fall of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from above the mid-market level on Thursday to mid-market level because he believed stock growth was limited to the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transportation sector's profits", Doerxen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to gain a foothold in the lower-priced segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominant.
The first experimental aircraft was introduced in March and made its first flight in September after several months of delay.
However, the firm orders for CSeries are not too many yet, as potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to test the company's claims about the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media outlets that the program is moving ahead as planned.
The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected, Boduan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans tests differently.
We decided to make the first flight and take a break for the updates, and we did.
This is what's going to happen throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all the others will follow shortly, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the commissioning date and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow flight test pace - although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015", said Doerxen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income declined to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted earnings per share remained the same as the previous  9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from a previous year's 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The Aerospace Department's order portfolio was $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our objectives, but the small number of orders and overall market conditions were a disadvantage", said Bodoan.
Gross revenue in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross revenue in the sector grew almost 11 percent  to $2.1 billion.
The transportation department's order portfolio was $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly higher than the December 31 figure.
The revenue of the transport unit was negatively affected by the problems with the execution of several major contracts.
The management said that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, which also announced that Google chief financial officer Patrick Peachett will join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in mid-Thursday's auctions.
Embraer SA, Brazil's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent quarterly revenue decline on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual earnings
Japanese electronics maker Sony, after closing the quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, driven by a decline in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company its first operating profit in three years of 5.2 billion yen, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in operating losses in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through a difficult time, especially because of the decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of this difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main competitors, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial parts: sales are growing at a rapid pace, especially with automotive systems and clean technology.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to generate 179 billion yen in operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
According to Thomson Reuters, analysts predicted that the figure would be much higher, at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to recover from the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In mid-June, a Japanese company announced the launch of a smartwatch with a range of fashion features that will eliminate the need to pull a smartphone out of your pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11 percent this morning at the opening of the Tokyo stock market, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
Speech gene has been a stimulant for synapses
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein that allows the Foxp2 speech gene to function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and you can read a brief summary on the magazine's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 when a family of several people was discovered who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes even themselves could not understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have impaired the function of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least some of Foxp2's functions are as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with speech formation.
It does this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by looking for factors that stimulate synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 claiming to be active.
That SRPX2 actually affects vocalization, scientists have confirmed in a mouse experiment.
When the animals' genes were artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sounds would be restored.
Earlier, mice were also shown to be associated with the vocalisation of Foxp2.
Animals that were injected with a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
However, scientists still do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 it controls is related to purely "mechanical" sound-forming properties or to more subtle processes.
A cocaine addict lawyer who warned a criminal group leader about a police investigation is jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditta was handing information to criminal authority Neal Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
Sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prominent lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared exposure to his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was handing over secret information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough about his drug trafficking investigation after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and called among criminals the "Crazy Lawyer", was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to track down Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditt was regularly using class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrests of two people on Scarborough's orders, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organisation selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized a series of raids on heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and over £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Ditt was passing information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, at the Liverpool Crown Court, Ditta, who works for the Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, was shamed after pleading guilty to two counts of deliberately obstructing justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer's disclosure came after police investigating Scarborough's activities found he had been regularly talking to Ditt on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him approaching Ditt's home in Blackburn and putting 60-percent clean drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's trash can.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditt, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home to pick up the drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court found out that Ditt was a regular cocaine user after tests found traces of class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer as he was his client, and insisted that their communication constituted a "lawyer's secret".
During his detention, Ditt took his wallet and tried to get out a few credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample taken.
When he was questioned by the police, he said that in addition to his job, he had a home office, and clients came to his house for legal business.
However, it became known that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in the illegal drug trade, a number of which he had previously presented to the court to tell what detectives knew about them.
In her arraignment speech, Anne White said, "If anyone knows that you shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal defense lawyer".
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney because he has become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has far exceeded the boundaries of the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He has obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta disrespected his profession and embarrassed it.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his lack of interest to be questioned.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough information, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately".
But after the hearing, senior Lancashire Police Officer Lee Holstead said: "Mr. Ditto has gone from a criminal lawyer to a criminal once he started buying drugs from organized crime".
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targets of the main gangs who had entrusted him with the task of obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditte's case was led by Lancashire's Special Offences Unit, which has already obtained a conviction for three counts of cocaine possession and now for obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to a fair punishment for perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the scheme were sentenced to 153 years in prison for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta has organized a Q&A conversation in which he says that his dream job is to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his ideal dinner companion is Muhammad Ali, and the motivation in the job is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22 thousand spectators, police officials who were present at the meeting of the Russian Federation's KDK said.
The ticketing program is, they say, about doubled.
During the match of 1/16 of the Russian Cup final with "Spartak" were only a thousand stewards with a regulation norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were expected to have 2200 seats, or 10 percent of the stadium's capacity, but, according to an agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
This information was announced by the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoriantz.
The Americans listened to the Japanese officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the U.S. intelligence officials, who chose not to be named, said the United States had been wiretapping Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several listening points in the land of the rising sun.
He also noted that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand are not engaged in intelligence activities against each other.
He said that was the case during World War II, when these countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, despite its postwar alliances with the Americans, is a target for intelligence, NHK reported.
No official comment has been made on the information.
We'll recall that the news about the surveillance of the German Chancellor by the US intelligence services came out last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have been wiretapping Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some reports, was very hurt when she heard about her wiretapping.
She said that Germany and the United States, which she believes have been allies for decades, would not allow such an observation of the head of government.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden has said he's ready to share details of Angela Merkel's phone conversations with German prosecutors.
The German flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA employee.
The country may put grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014
During the state procurement interventions, the country can put the grain on the market not earlier than the beginning of 2014, says the minister of agriculture of the republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
Currently, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, there's demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year", he said at a press conference yesterday.
The minister recalled that this year the crop yields for the 2013 crop were 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
The 2014 crop is 550 thousand hectares (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area for winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the rye has remained at the same level.
There's no Brotherhood Circle in the home base, which Leps was assigned to in the US.
The Russian security forces' database does not include the "Brother Circle" group, to which Washington has listed singer Grigory Leps.
As reported by Interfax in the Russian law enforcement agencies, after reports emerged in the media about the US finance ministry's entry of Gregory Leps into the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother's Circle", all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The spread of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which is supposedly operating abroad, according to the force structures.
"Even the name itself, the 'Brotherhood Circle', has a certain element of mystery, a hint of a secret lodge.
"It's all very much like a publicity stunt", said the agency's interviewer.
The U.S. Treasury Department on October 31 announced that it had included Arthur Badalan, Grigory Lepswriдзе, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Shlykov in its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother Circle".
The individuals on the list are suspected of being connected to some of the most influential members of the criminal groups, including Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who have been on the U.S. sanctions list since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
The Gregory Leps Production Center declined to comment on the US charges against the singer, calling them a "fraud".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama listed the Brotherhood as one of the "significant transnational organized crime groups" and instructed the U.S. Treasury Department to "undermine and ban their global criminal operations".
The US Treasury blacklisting of a person means blocking his assets in the US and prohibiting business contact with individuals residing in the States.
Scandalous video got into the police.
Toronto chief Rob Ford, known for his outrageous and frankly reckless behavior, got caught smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they had the video and were ready to investigate the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reports.
Information that authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use has been published on the Toronto Police Department's website.
Local law enforcement chief Bill Blair held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he wasn't authorized to share the footage with the public, but he's committed to it.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during a drug raid by law enforcement in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously reported on the video, but until recently, there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself has no comment on this.
He's just saying he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to resign.
The video was discovered by police and is one of the pieces of evidence in the case of Ford's 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisey, who is accused of drug trafficking, extortion, illegal income and conspiracy.
At times, Lisi performed the functions of a Rob Ford driver.
The townspeople have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He has fought with journalists repeatedly, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself to make racist and sexist remarks.
Rostovaeroinvest has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the general designer of the project.
The amount of the contract is not disclosed by Rostovaeroinvest.
According to the press service of the OAO, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent for state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner will design the airport's new passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and airport complex improvement elements.
In the first phase of construction, the terminal's internal area will be 50 thousand square meters, and it is possible to increase it further.
According to Rostovaerinvest, the project documentation will take into account the development prospects of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
At the time of the tender's conclusion, the architectural concept of the airport complex "Southern" was defined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal building embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in the implementation of large projects, the company designed the C and E terminals of the Sheremetyevo International Airport and the new airport terminal complex at the Knevichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex "South" will be built in the Aksai district of Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the urban development.
Construction of the airport complex is scheduled to begin in 2014, and all facilities will be commissioned in 2017.
Turkish politician declared a hunger strike against wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a dividing wall in the area of Nusain, in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the Prokurdy party of the PYD were strongly opposed to the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin Ayşe Gechan, which is on the border with Syria, has declared a hunger strike, protesting the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
Turkey's Foreign Minister Muammer Güller first denied the construction, then said the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Major Nusaybin Aishe Geekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the wall into a deadly struggle", the party's press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds have crossed this border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never accept", party officials quoted Ayşe Geekhan as saying.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the dividing wall is planned for November 7 in Nusaibin.
Venezuela will set a currency rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the bolivar, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1 with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of US dollars in one year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the Bolivar they buy in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devaluate the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for Economics Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela had no plans to devaluate the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of price control over products and goods of wide consumption, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a number of goods shortages and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Yugra's director Andrey Belmach said it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after Sergei Shepelev resigned.
The resignation was only a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I'm not ready", Belmach said.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all the options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don't want to just find a coach, I want to find someone who's gonna work for our club for a few years and get some results.
Kenya press outraged by provocative law on media
"This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
This law is very strict and punitive, and we reject it said Cyrus Camaou, managing director of Capital Group parent company CapitalFM, which is one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media judiciary would always be biased, as it is an extension of the government, and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs, he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to "take the media by the dead" and The Standard reported that democracy and free speech in Kenya had "been hit hard" and criticized the bill as "Draconian".
The bill's passage is part of a national security effort following the September Muslim terrorist attack on the Westgate shopping center.
Kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras showing troops sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbing an expensive shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaio reacted by calling two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was canceled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with the added risk of being "excluded from the lists", i.e. banned from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations.
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called "living blogosphere" of Kenya.
Politicians understand that by keeping the media silent, they can do whatever they want, with impunity.
"Nobody ever knows", wrote Nation journalist Matthew Mutuma, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of restraining and balancing forces in public life.
"The politicians who are left to themselves will destroy the country and turn us back to hunting and gathering", he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel the national payroll cuts and restore their huge tax-free salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, one of the highest in the world.
The townsfolk will be paid a new line of expenses - a capital repair.
According to the most approximate calculations, a standard two-room apartment will have to be paid from 100 to 400 rubles per month from the new year.
The exact regulations will be determined by the regional government.
But when you paint the hallway, fix the stairs, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the residents.
The law was approved by the members of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyutnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, we must set the order - to set the order of house repairs, to accumulate funds not in the managing companies - which we often register in Moscow, in Orenburg, or elsewhere, this will be the establishment of state control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for repairs of apartment buildings".
The state controls the building industry.
The law protecting against fraud is approved by the legislature at the last reading.
The document was not born in a vacuum.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems were solved.
By the way, the new law sets out the rights and obligations for all participants in the joint construction.
Vladimir Klyutnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this sphere there have also been abuses related to the fact that in 98 the same shareholders got the same, and in the 2000s the same shareholders".
People started making money from it to cover the gap, including passing these two laws.
A temporary residence centre for foreigners to be deported is being built in Voronezh.
The provincial parliament passed this law not only under pressure from the federation.
At least get rid of the problems with illegal immigrants in the region.
Last year, just over 100,000 foreigners were registered.
But only one in five has a work permit.
Where the rest of us work and whether we pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klutchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, said: "They violated the law, but they are not criminals".
There's no court, and they need to be deported.
The federation decided to equip such places with regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, this place is called Old Olshanka of the Semiluk district.
And finally, the regional parliament has given new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with five or more children are exempt from transportation tax.
The budget is 3.5 million dollars in this case, but parents with many children can save just as much.
Secondly, and most importantly, those who adopt three or more children will receive housing subsidies from the new year.
The new law provides for 18 square meters for each family member, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
A family, for example, consists of six people - a father, a mother, a child and a third - an adopted child.
For them, according to the regulations, the state purchases a housing area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the Southwest neighborhood, it's a good option.
Well, that's a lot of money to buy a cottage in the county.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkalia
The current board of directors of OJSC "Uralkali" has proposed the candidacy of the arrested in Minsk general director Vladislav Baumgertner to the new board, the website of the Russian company reports.
Bamugertner is one of 11 people nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on November 29, at which a new board of directors will be determined by vote.
At the moment Baumgertner is under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was arrested in August of this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
However, later, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that the charges against Baumgertner were re-qualified as "theft".
Matt Dalton, the spokesman for the "Neftechemical", declined to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of a trainer for the Nizhnekamsk people.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin has a lot of authority with the players and will handle his responsibilities.
Let's recall, today, Neftekimik has resigned Krikunov.
I don't want to comment on the firing of Vladimir Krikunov, "Dalton quotes RIA Novosti.
All I can say is that Dmitry Balmin will handle the obligations he has been entrusted with, and I have no doubt about that.
He's a great authority on the team, and there's a great future for this young specialist.

US Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes "go too far" in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when gathering data and wiretapping, U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes "go too far", but the politician noted that the media coverage of the 70 million wiretapping was not true.
I assure you, innocent people were not harmed in this process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I acknowledge this, as does the president... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future", the foreign secretary quoted AFP as saying.
Italian workers with experience are giving way to younger workers
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
The data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country's population is now unemployed.
Things haven't been this bad since World War II.
Among young people, this is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the eyes of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
The experiment is already being conducted by the country's largest energy company, and the laws passed allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement for employees with experience.
Italy, on the other hand, faces a common problem for Europe: the aging population.
And economists aren't sure that the premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
What the construction of the TPU in Moscow will bring
Every year , the capital authorities promise to equip more transportation hubs .
It is planned to put into operation 255 TPUs by 2020.
Our correspondent knew what the project was about.
A couple of months ago, the Arbat-Pokrov metro was built.
The sign said the transportation and transiting hub was being repaired.
This was very strange, since no land transport stops near Smolensk and therefore cannot be transferred.
To get to the nearest trolley bus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to cross about 130 meters, including a land crossing through the Karmanitz Pass.
Smolenskaya's almost finished.
The flower bed is gone, the newspaper stand is dismantled, and the asphalt is replaced with a brick.
That's the whole transportation hub.
Transportation and transportation hubs are flat and large, the press service of the capital's transport department explains.
There's no capital gains yet.
The flat ones involve parking lots, removing commercial facilities that hinder passenger movement, creating small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, the flat-topped TPUs are not even handled by transport workers, but by professional planners from the Moscow City Department of Repair.
Transportation is not necessarily a complex design, explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes you can have a roof over your head and a sign to let you know when the transport is coming.
For example, the Yasenovo metro recently opened a fully-fledged flat transition hub.
No curtains, but with intercept parking and a sign indicating when the bus is coming.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials record everything they get in the TPU.
In 2011, the city planned to build 151 nodes, 59 of which were capital construction.
Now, there are 255 TPUs in the plans for 2020.
One and a half hundred of them are promised this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of the TPU, there are no quality criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and transport".
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often deteriorates.
The expert believes that there should be two criteria: first, reducing the time of transplantation, and second, convenience.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transportation without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, the TPU is sometimes reversed.
A vivid example of the VDNX subway.
Previously, suburban buses from Yaroslavl highway came to the square before the main entrance to the VWC.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavl on Cosmonaut Street.
Farther from the subway, farther from the monorail, but closer to the houses.
The residents didn't want the bus station under the windows and complained to all the authorities.
Capital flows in Moscow were not immediately a problem.
The first one was built five years ago by the Plannerny subway.
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And there's a real example of how a recycling hub that's been given back to investors is turning into a banal mall.
No, there's bus sheds, a rain-tight curtain and three floors of parking.
True, the chimney trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow TPU did not have a place in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
But there's more room left for trade.
There's only one clothing store, 32 stores, and there's almost everything from animal products to car dealerships.
Actually, who's gonna need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital market, for some reason, we always get a mall.
The situation recently reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot was decided to be put on the market.
Now on the third floor of the Plannerny TPU, there is a lively traffic among the parking spaces on the floor.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian language and guards staring at our photographer.
The transplantation node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, the plane station used to have a market, but it was torn down.
And in the prefecture, the merchants felt sorry for themselves and let the transplantation hub into the intercepting parking lot.
Still, because of the high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was torn down to make way for a new flat-bed trucking plant.
It's like a rock.
At the "Kaluzhskaya" metro, the distance from the metro vestibule to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 10pm, when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the designs on the "Planerny" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon be shown with flowers.
In mid-September, the city's land commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital trucks.
Four of them will be 25 stories, not counting two or three underground yards.
The main monster will grow near the "Tushino" metro, which will have 418,7 thousand square meters of space.
Representatives of the railway station directorate of the railway station of the Russian Federation, which is responsible for the construction of the train station near the metro, have already told journalists that the future multi-storey buildings will include shops, hotels and apartments.
Officials say multi-storey car parks will cover between a third and half of the area.
Take the "folk" garages for example.
Let's say a 258-seat garage recently built on International Street has an area of 8,015 square meters.
So, for parking 2,600 cars at Petrovsko-Razumovskaya, we'll need about 80,000 square feet.
That's less than a third of the machine they're gonna build there.
Have one or two floors of the bus sheds.
There's at least 150,000 square feet of commercial real estate left.
And that's, for one minute, almost two GUMs.
If the railway stations and stations are built by railway companies, the rest of the metro will be built by the metro.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow City Property Department recently told reporters that they were working on a draft resolution that would allow investors to directly contact officials to obtain a plot for the landfill.
No competition.
Because they say transportation is a priority for the city.
The perfect TPU is, for example, Harvard in Boston or Spadina in Toronto, says Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the level of the metro and the approach distance from the metro wagon to the tram is only 50 meters without going out.
There's no trade around.
But Moscow officials are getting too far away.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna tear down 25 stories of office and apartment buildings.
Esser proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremism
To protect citizens' patriotic feelings against provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Justice Russia" proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and punish it with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma energy committee Oleg Miheev have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the government for a decision.
Under the patriotic sentiments of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, a responsible attitude to its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
As Miheev points out, the national legislation has sanctions for abusing the official symbols of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt and insulted by state symbols, and other disrespectful manifestations of our country, in Russian legislation is not sufficiently worked out.
As an example, he cites the annual Victory Day discussions, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday - Victory Day, May 9 - a real vacanalia is held every year.
In their use of wit and "alternative views" of history, some journalists come to the conclusion that it is a pity that cultural Germans did not conquer the savage Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual scratch" of the nation", - Oleg Miheev indigns.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are more patriots in Russia than there are religious ones, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriot feelings can be practically unpunished.
According to the elected official, it is necessary to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to prescribe the appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for penalties for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000 fine to 5 years in prison.
A magnitude 6.6 earthquake struck on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters reports.
The epicenter of the quake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and 54 kilometers southwest of the city, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
There have been no reports of casualties or destruction caused by the earthquake.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismically active regions on earth, so earthquakes of varying intensity are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
At that time, an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami that it caused killed more than 550 people in Chile and destroyed 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: a magnitude of 9.5 was recorded there in 1960.
More than five thousand people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the Greenpeace activists' case will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be heard in accordance with the law, we hear all concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the law", said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Erot.
Among the Greenpeace activists arrested is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanou, like the other activists, is accused of hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen", Mr. Erro is quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can cause harm to the environment, no one has the right to violate laws", said Dmitry Medvedev.
He said any structure that tries to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, is dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "like a powder keg", and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN announces new goals for poverty alleviation
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in pushing forward the Sustainable Development Goals to replace the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals, which are due to expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document that world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, will sign during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told summit participants the night before that it was time to "stand above national interests".
I am pleased that UN member states have agreed to launch and take over the process of creating the SDGs, he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will use the powers vested in me by the Member States to implement our vision of the SDGs, which are based on the successful implementation of the SDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict between powerful people
Under the statue of Samora Mashel, the founding president of Mozambique, facing them from top to bottom, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability", said Vanessa de Souza, chief executive of the investment firm.
Fearing for her country's future, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital's Independence Square.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo came in, some of the most brutal since the armistice was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to escalate to full-scale conflict again, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge gas and coal shelf stocks in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale in Brazil, Eni in Italy and Anadarko in the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has been behind the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels were intensified when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlacamu, the group's leader, according to Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armand Gebuza tried to dispel fears about instability.
Gebusa told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlacame felt a failure, wishing to use whatever was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after Mazinga announced that Renamo had withdrawn from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant the Frelimo party was not following the agreement.
"Our goal is to get back to negotiations, but with all seriousness", Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has been heightened by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two influential people (Gebusa and Dhlacame) who have come face to face", said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators, and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weakened movement to seek concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of the vote for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new  Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) party, which was founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga says Mr. Gebusa, who is due to step down next year at the end of his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency", Mazinga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key motorway leading from north to south.
Most of the encounters took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes the port of Beirut, which mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended use of the railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazinga was hesitant when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to warn the international community that things were not going very well in Mozambique, Mazanga said.
The instability has increased government discontent, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that they should find a solution to these problems", he says.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said the people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want free access to the roads", he said.
The Art-Mainstream series of premiere films will be held in Moscow
The Art-Mainstream series of films, where viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they go on sale, will be held at the Roland cinema from November 1 to 5, according to the project's organizers.
The Art Mainstream program is opened by French comedy filmmaker and actress Reim Kerrichi's Paris at any cost.
This is the story of Maya (Mrs. Kerrichi) who works in the French capital and is deported to her homeland, Morocco, because of her visa issues.
In addition to the Kerrichi film, the audience will also be shown the new film by the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk "Mebius", Oliver Hirschbiegels melodramatic biography "Diana: A Love Story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Adel's Life" by Abdelatif Keshis.
The only Russian participant in the Art-Mainstream will be the winner of the film "Kinotavr" by Alexander Veledinsky "Geograph Globe Propiled" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Viktor Служкина - was played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotavra".
Children should learn myths and legends as lifestyle models, says the author.
Torah stories could show that the Rough Force can't beat subtle cunning, and legends about King Arthur show the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would prove too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too indecent to teach in schools, Crosley-Holland advocates careful selection of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating for them to be included in the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the over-moralizing behavior of authors and teachers is repulsive to children, and the basic ideas are sublimated into fascinating stories.
Crosley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote a collection of Norwegian myths for Penguin and British folktales, said: "You may have intentions, but you'd better keep them to yourself".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
It is not that everything should be simplified or that it should lead to a happy ending, but that there should be an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it has to be sublimated; exposed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old saying is show, not tell.
In Voronezh region, a football fan was arrested for breaking a window in the waiting room of the train station
At nine o'clock on October 29, at the Gryzi-Voronegsk station, transport police officers pulled two football fans from the passenger train.
On their way to the game, the guys got drunk and got into a train fight.
The young men were taken to the police station in Gryzi to write a report on the administrative offence.
Fans were sorry for their anti-social behavior.
The police filed administrative documents and released them.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and waited for him at the station.
At midnight, the fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, came back and broke the entrance window in the waiting room.
A transport police officer and a guard at the "RJD" police station were knocked over by a broken glass.
They've managed to arrest a criminal trying to flee the scene.
The staff of the South-Eastern Unit of the Russian Interior Ministry are conducting a check.
The issue of criminal case is being raised, the senior referent of the information and public relations department of the Southeast Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the transportation Sergei Olkhovik said.
What about watermelons?
I think we're back 15 years.
Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the unrest on the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I'm for the organizers of sports events, clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they've taken a different position.
They're waiting for someone from the outside to come and clean up.
It's a very good position, but not quite right.
We need to organize the fans, the clubs should invite their stewards, not let the business get to the bottom of it.
We've just developed a special government decree on rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it's passed, we'll take a closer look at this problem.
But I'm still going to invite all the football organizers to my house.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, please, make the law quick.
It feels like it was the Bavarian fans who came to Yaroslavl and arranged it.
We're outside observers.
And it's really awful to see the stage being sprayed with fireworks.
And this is a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back to 10-15 years ago", Mutko said.
Snowden could be questioned in Russia
Former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify in cases involving German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone conversations.
As a source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday, the American can answer questions from the German prosecutor general's office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's exit from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In that case, he will lose his refugee status and could be extradited to Washington by US allies", the agency said.
"At the same time, in principle, the Federal Prosecutor General's Office could send its representatives to Russia or send written questions to Snowden", the source added, adding that the issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Schrebelle said that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in a case about the American intelligence services' wiretapping of the German chancellor's negotiations.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement either in Moscow or on German soil.
The former CIA employee made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined", - told the Euronews channel.
Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the Interfax statement, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how would be his decision.
Edward Snowden, a U.S. citizen who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, and later released information about secret surveillance operations by U.S. intelligence agencies on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow by transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was canceled by the US authorities, who had made serious accusations against him on the fly and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left "Sheremetyevo" the same day.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoliy Kucherena said that his client had taken a job with a "large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported last week by German media.
According to the journalists, the chancellor's phone conversations were first heard by the Americans in 2002.
The surveillance station was supposedly at the US Embassy in Berlin.
German authorities, after publishing this information, said that monitoring Merkel violated German laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev has left "Fair Russia"
Deputy of the State Duma from the party "Justice Russia", a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev submitted an application to leave the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he filed the application in the party's regional branch in Novosibirsk.
According to her charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "Stras".
We're sitting here drinking tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the painting "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal about it", the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the "esers".
Meanwhile, the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma Ilya Ponomarev is not intended to be abandoned.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot leave it by law.
The news of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the party "Justice Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that along with him from the "SR" would come out Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov, however, the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Russia
Fumio Kissida, head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the issues of further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty", Kisid said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the two countries became warmer and became bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that Russia will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the settlement of the disputed Northern territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today to demand the return of the land lost to the country after World War II.
The Japanese capital is being driven by cars that are being called "Return the Northern Territories!"
The police do not stop the protesters, they are watching to ensure that the noise level does not exceed.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: The New Yorker
It's safe to say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, stage performer Frank Faye, who was a conference speaker at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in a conversational manner.
Fae's innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Carolyn Hersch, founder of the Carolines Standup Club, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
"Most of these headliners started in the Carolines, and then they got more success, to a point where they're too famous to be in a club", Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Katy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the annual musical comedy charity concert for veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity through non-traditional channels, such as shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained fame for his role in the little-known comedy series on the cable television channel (the famous FXX fantasy-football-themed FXX League), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast on Saturday nights in both the live stream and the theme parks and recreation areas, although she is best known for the viral series Marcel - the shell in the shoes.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with a unique style (surrealistly pessimistic Anthony Jasselnik, cunningly focused on the racial themes of Camaou Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a standup comedian, but later became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
This city is definitely the centerpiece of Larry's work, Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down a street between two houses and thinks, 'If I run out of money, maybe I'll live here.'
Pakistani authorities start talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the UK, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, is on a visit.
The head of the Pakistani government made a statement about negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister has announced that dialogue with the Taliban movement has begun", the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
- He said he hopes and prays for dialogue to work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan", the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the northwestern areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking to create an Islamic state.
Earlier, the government of Islamabad had attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only enter into negotiations if the authorities moved troops to permanent locations in areas where the Taliban were active and released the arrested Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif has arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil has dropped to $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, when alarms over the buildup of large reserves overshadowed a message that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The U.S. oil benchmark in December's supply was down 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 a barrel late in the morning European time at the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was down 39 cents, which in total was a 5.8 percent drop in October.
The rich oil reserves have affected its price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. reserves have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves have been filled up by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was a hint of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after the third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent from a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, the benchmark international oil used by U.S. refineries, has fallen 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Colorado's head coach Patrick Roach, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes of Friday's game with Dallas, expressed confidence that his recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas "SE" owner Natalia Shmelev.
"What are we waiting for?" said Roa after the morning's "Lavin' swing".
Of course, we're all concerned about what happened, but we believe in him and feel it's good for him to get on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely certain that the situation didn't affect the goalkeeper's condition?
We'll see about that today.
I'm sure our players will support Varley by helping him guard the gate like they did in the previous games of the season.
The point is, no one on the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court has a handle on this.
In Siberia, you shouldn't be vegan: greenhouse tomatoes won't replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, RIA Novosti's correspondent found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
They cannot survive the winter without losing their health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, say dietitians and doctors in New Siberia surveyed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drinking oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, which refuses not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietitians believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, adhering to such strict dietary norms is at least not good for health.
A complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for by plant proteins.
You must include at least milk or eggs in your diet", says dietician Marina Bogaj.
She cites a fish that contains the essential omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink in liters!" says a nutritionist.
Doctors believe that Siberian people should pay special attention to their diet in winter.
Vegetarianism is especially questioned this season.
In our present situation, food is highly demanded.
You need a lot of calories to keep from freezing.
"If you restrict yourself to animal foods, you're not getting enough calories", says the expert.
This is what the dietician Olga Poznyak agrees with.
She adds that importing fruit and vegetables is not the way out.
It is best to eat mainly foods grown in the region where you live or where you were born.
The genetic code is designed to better digest and digest these products.
In winter, people want to eat hot soup or something more satisfying than pickles", the doctor explains.
She says that vegan foods are really good for grains, legumes, beans, local vegetables, apples left over in the winter, frozen berries.
But that is clearly not enough to feed a full diet.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifuulina, Siberians have sufficient vitamin levels only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when temperatures can change by 30 degrees in a day and snow is falling in May, is not a good idea.
The body needs energy to live, and this is primarily fat", says the doctor.
Doctors say that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Kids grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by being vegetarian, we give them to the underdogs.
Pregnant women also need a higher protein, vitamin, and micronutrient intake.
"Vegans don't get them", God knows.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "play whatever toys he wants".
He's got a body, a skeleton, organs.
And yet, children should eat well.
If parents deprive him of some micro-elements or amino acids by choosing what he eats, it's just a violation of the child's rights.
"You can't recover from a lack of brain, vision, and bone growth tomorrow", she says.
All the medical experts surveyed agree on the low quality of winter vegetables and fruits grown in greenhouses and imported.
What we get and grow in greenhouses contains fewer of the micronutrients we need than what we grow in open ground.
"The quality of the food is not the same", says Bogai.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse fruits and vegetables are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the producers' desire to harvest more harvests is detrimental to the quality.
"Apples don't turn brown when cut, cucumbers turn yellow and mould quickly, tomatoes are tasteless and flavorless", the doctor says, adding that they are likely to be soaked in excess fertilizer.
And they're not suppliers of vitamins, they're suppliers of fiber.
I don't agree with this from the head of the Siberian Institute of Agrarian Physics and Technology, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that if all the greenhouse regulations and requirements are followed and followed properly, it is possible to grow whole vegetables.
If they try to get more out of the square meter, they will of course water more often and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there is too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large but watery and unsweetened", she explains, adding that the quality issue is primarily a matter for the producer's conscience.
The court suspended the execution of the arrest and search order in the New York Police Department .
On Thursday, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals suspended a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's "suspend-and-search" program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has said that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin's decisions will be suspended until the city receives the outcome of the appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in its implementation of the street detention and interrogation program.
The city appealed her decision and the order for corrective action, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police department change its work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the appeals court heard the parties' petitions to stay the case.
The Court of Appeals stated that the judge had to be removed because she violated the US judges' code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably targeting black and Latino people under the "stop-and-search" program.
She appointed an external controller to oversee the large-scale changes that include policy, education and control reforms, and also decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted cameras at police stations where most arrests occur.
In August, New York City decided to stop keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were closed after a police investigation.
The appeals are due to be heard after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of arrest and search has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The search-and-rescue operation has been going on for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under independent mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all  representatives of national minorities, filed a class action suit in court.
Supporters of the New York Police Department's Stop and Search program say the changes will put an end to unethical practices, create a more reliable and efficient police service, and could affect how other police departments implement these practices.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the fighting spirit of police officers, not the crime rate, lead to unnecessary waste of money and will not solve the more global problem of the complex conditions in police due to the decline in the number of officers by several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the constitutional practice of "stop-and-go", but changed the way the NYPD stops people.
Pedestrian zone opened in the area of the Tretyakov gallery
A new pedestrian zone has been established in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a two-kilometer site from the "Novokuznetska" metro station to the Balot Square.
Throughout the street, flowerbeds, benches, urns and toilets were installed, deaf fences and illegal advertising removed.
Besides the Klimentov and Lavrushkin alleys, five streets - the Ordinal dead end, the Large and Small Tolmachev alleys, the Kadashev coast and the Bolt Square - were closed to cars.
The traffic on the streets of Marošej and Petrovka is not restricted.
On the Friday street from the vestibule of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to the Klimentovo alley, pedestrians were allowed to walk without cutting the traffic, reports newsmsk.com.
The walking area includes the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the Holy Martyr Clement of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
The Tver Pass, Stoлешnikov Avenue and Kuznetskiy Bridge were previously fully pedestrianised.
The Great Dmtrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, was closed to cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hacking to check a confidential message .
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used a phone grab, surveillance and confrontation to try to prove false information about the novel by Charles Clark, then Home Secretary.
Prosecutor, Royal Counsel Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the News of the World newspaper received false news that Clark was meeting his attractive special adviser, Hannah Polby.
The paper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcair to hack into Polby's voicemail and stalked her at home to interview, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, the court heard.
The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor, is not the kind of person who would stand by someone's house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he's the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they'll say, Mr. Edith said.
He said News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second one, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yeah!"
The rumors of Clark's novel first came to the attention of News of the World when a source with a sexual interest in Mrs. Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
A tape of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer that featured Miss Polby and her sister as "Projects".
During the period she was under surveillance, Mrs. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edith said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weserap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow and I would very much like to discuss it with Charles".
Mr. Edith said Coulson's involvement in this story was based on the same scenario as other influential people, like former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blanket over an affair with a married woman while he was himself dating his maternal girlfriend Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny any collusion with other people to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Turlbeck and Weserap have confessed to hacking phones.
Snowden says he is ready to talk to the authorities of Germany about the case of wiretapping
Former CIA employee Edward Snowden is ready to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to meet with the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
A former CIA employee's letter to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Strebel, through whom Snowden forwarded the message to the German authorities.
The day before, Schrebel met with Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured in a fire on Tverskaya street
As a result of a fire in a collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya street, four passersby were injured.
According to the Interfax, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby who were in the smoke underground passage were injured.
According to RIA Novosti, with reference to the head of the capital's fuel-energy department, Pavel Livinski, electricity supply is now fully restored in all houses on Tverskaya street.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya street occurred on the evening of October 31.
Heavy smoke came from the storm drain, and smoke came from the underground passage near the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya street were destroyed.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
The U.S. cut food aid to the poor
The food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 a month
From Friday, the financial support for food stamps, known as "food stamps", is being cut in the United States as the current state program ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be $36 less a month than before, officials say.
It will affect 47 million of America's poorest people.
According to Reuters, in fiscal 2012, the average monthly benefit per person was $133.
Food aid spending in the United States has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 percent of Americans rely on free food assistance, provided through food stamps, which have been so called since the days when they had paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to boost economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts in funding for the program, stating that it should be directed toward those who need it most.
Grocery store owners across America are concerned that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how to further cut government funding.
Blizzard has released a 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard released its 1994 platform Blackthorne for free on PC.
This is what WoW Insider is reporting.
According to him, the game is available on Battle.net in the classic games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that currently only users whose accounts are part of the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is not yet available.
According to media reports, the PC version that Blizzard has released is not different from the original version.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES.
It was set on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and a light kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight Sarlak's henchmen and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its name change to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was called Silicon & Synapse before.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
New machines will be built in the Moscow metro.
But they're not going to sell tickets to passengers for money, they're going to sell tickets for seating.
One trip of 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated by a special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS, citing the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be installed at the Exhibition Station on November 8, 2013.
The new sportsmen will be presented by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamoladchikova.
The National Security Agency 's recognition reinforces corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's internal intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the US embassy building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect antennas of wiretapping devices, and this action led to negotiations between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the United States is not using foreign intelligence to steal foreign companies' trade secrets for the benefit of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, the contract clerk who became the disclosor, started releasing his treasure trove of US intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was tracking Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia over state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been tapped for, perhaps, about a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are, of course, potential targets.
Snowden made it clear that there is an intense cooperation between the U.S. intelligence community and the companies.
I think it's quite likely that this data is being used to mutual benefit.
Germany needs to wake up says Oliver Grun, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consulting agency EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there is no evidence yet that the United States has passed on foreign trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain capabilities in information technology and the Internet and said it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical of this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not an option", says Gassso Platner, president of German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it shouldn't have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everyone but the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical development of the U.S. spy agencies that have become known through Snowden's revelations has come as a shock to some companies that once thought China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is coming in cloud technology, where European company executives are more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants have given up on plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. data intelligence software Prism.
Jim Sneab, one of SAP's executive directors, said, "We're seeing consumers asking a new question that didn't come up a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that it will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports  are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets, and therefore, these data must be protected at all costs.
What's happening with economic espionage is not surprising.
He always had a place.
"It's been a topic of discussion for years and hasn't changed much in the current controversy", says Kurt Bock, chief executive of BASF Chemical.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually don't like to brag about the retaliatory measures they've taken, because it can give an advantage to the opponent.
Large companies have long been fond of the idea of taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of Audi, says that for many years it has been standard practice  to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The Federal Constitution Protection Service of Germany recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid cell phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders in their niche in the global market.
Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,  warns the BfV report.
The United States is warning its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Community in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, second only to China in breaches of economic intelligence, The Washington Post reports.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Scarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies".
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a ridiculous accident believe their son was killed.
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a folded sports mat in his high school gym believe their son was killed, family attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdost, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertical mattress lying behind the stands in his high school gym.
The Lounders County Sheriff's Office has concluded that Johnson died tragically, but the 17-year-old's family disputes this.
"They're absolutely certain their son was killed", said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
They think it's against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense, Crump said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they returned him to them in a body bag, he said.
U.S. attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the statement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
"I believe there is sufficient ground for an official investigation", he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed Johnson had died of asphyxiation.
But the second autopsy, Moore said, revealed a different cause of death.
There are a few questions that need to be addressed or clarified, he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to call for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he'll ask the FBI to bring him in.
A representative from the Lounders County Sheriff's Department was unavailable for comment when he was contacted Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video footage that investigators were viewing.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video would hold the key to how he died.
"Spartak": For information about the people who hung the fascist symbol
The official website of Spartacus has a statement from the Moscow club regarding the appearance of a fascist flag on the podium in Yaroslavl.
"At the cup match between Shinnik and Spartacus on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We ask anyone with reliable information about the perpetrators of this crime to provide it.
"The reward is guaranteed", the statement said.
We're looking for fans who have hung the fascist flag in Yaroslavl.
We will remind you that in the match of 1/16 of the final of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak" was interrupted several times due to unrest on the stands.
Also in the Spartacus fan sector, fascist symbolism was demonstrated.
In the form of a penalty, Spartacus can play about three matches without spectators.
There's a committee meeting on Friday.
If you have any information about who passed through and hung this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for controlling food allergies in school children.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies increases.
Now, one in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to help if an allergic reaction occurs.
It also recommends schools keep a supply of adrenaline  Most commonly used for injections is the EpiPen  automatic medical syringe to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently changed regulations to allow schools to stockpile adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notice also lists typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Kids can say, "I feel like something's touching my tongue, I feel like I have hair on my tongue, or a tongue of sticks on my tongue".
Intersex parents can choose an unknown gender.
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with an external sex organ of the intermediate type.
The newborn will no longer be assigned male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as "uncertain" or "uncertain" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to reduce pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man or a woman".
I'll be a doctor-made shrunken product with bruises and scars.
About one in 2,000 babies born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexity, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction, a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovariates or sperm) or unusually developed external sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law would sound like a good idea.
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don't", he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then watch the personality develop.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, and typically both at the same time or not characteristic of either.
These characteristics may be expressed in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body composition; primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudiced crime.
Boys with gender differences now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to place a male, female or third gender in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie Mae-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as "sexual" after defending the right to a life-long "non-sexual status" in court.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the third designation in German passports will be used in addition to the M and F  X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a highly Catholic country, signed a petition to remove gender theory from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is entering a new state where gender is a matter of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization".
A newborn mother in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would prefer to have their babies have sex assigned at birth.
Raising a child is quite difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child she told a parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia were called hermaphroditic after the beautiful Greek god who had both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community saw gender as a sheet where you can erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many are questioning the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive their assigned gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called an emergency psychiatric case", Dresser said.
When you had children like this, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily modified.
He introduced the term gender identity and argued that environmental signals, including social signals, about how parents raise a child, interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person will consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during a careless circumcision to completely castrate the child, removing his testicles as well, and raise him as a girl.
Manny presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn't, Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dr. Drescher said that some doctors are still using this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who had survived these sex reassignment operations declared themselves unhappy with the results.
And so was Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but with mid-range genitalia.
Doctors could not determine for sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he could never live a full man's life.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genital organs and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He started getting female hormones at age 12.
I knew I wasn't a girl, he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he was given vaginal surgery.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a developmental disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he found out the truth, he became a man again, taking testosterone shots and removing his breast.
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, he is a spokesperson for the Interface Project, an organization that seeks to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law encourages the labeling and stigma.
"Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an 'uncertain gender,'" she said.
We're afraid he's going to facilitate the intervention.
We think it's best to have a male or female gender and then wait.
But we haven't seen how this law will work yet, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it allows adults to make choices in favor of the third gender.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender identity", she says.
German law implies that it is given at birth.
It's a battle that little kids shouldn't be involved in at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Barats, a Pittsburgh mammologist and radiologist who has a daughter with a developmental disability and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would support both parents and children.
Barratt's daughter, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual developmental disorder called androgen-resistant syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie has developed female features.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at 29, Katie is married and is pursuing a residency in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves", Barratt said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and figure out the situation, and also the time before they write the male or female.
Then you're fine. Raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful baby, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in decision-making and eliminates the anxiety that drives parents because they don't feel they're doing the right thing", she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which sex is more comfortable for him or her, and that's great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin said he knows he has to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two games of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six saves from Tampa Bay, then four from Ottawa, and in the second game, he was replaced after the fourth saves.
We have to play well, and I haven't been able to do that in the last two games", Habibulin said.
- I need to find confidence in training, maybe I should approach it like a game, and try to get the best results.
You need to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were there.
There are a few small components I need to improve, but I feel pretty decent in training.
But somehow, after a few heads, it all turns into some kind of snowflake.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to make the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens outside my door.
I'm still working on myself to keep my sails at bay.
It's great that my teammates are supporting me, but the bottom line is simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to do a lot better.
But it happened, what happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next game better.
A bus has been diverted in Altai.
In the Rubtsov district of Altai Territory, the PAZ bus turned.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were injured, the regional headquarters of the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
Earlier, the region's law enforcement authorities reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at about 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaiyevka - Vishnevka highway, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaiyevka.
The bus, which was travelling from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, had 12 passengers and a driver, all of whom suffered injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven of the victims were taken to the No. 1 Rubtsovsk City Hospital, two people were hospitalized in the Central Reserve Bank of Rubtsovsk.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will get more than 170 such aircraft", Interfax quotes Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev as saying at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The Russian government chief noted that serious cooperation with French colleagues has been established, as it is a joint project.
We've been discussing some financial issues today that are related to insurance, but we hope that once this aircraft is stronger in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will be delivered to France", the Russian prime minister stressed.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the Civil Aircraft Dry Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Dnipropetrovsk Energy Department has launched a unique program to save... the nest of the Aist.
In the old days, peasants would set up a wheel from a wagon on a high pole to attract the Aist to the yard, and the heavy nest would hold well on it.
Since no such support has been established for a long time, the Aists have been fascinated by the pillars of the electricity transmission lines - the interwoven branches are supported by wires, which makes the Aist house stand firmly.
Anya's grandmother, whose family has been living in Petrikovsk village for twenty years, began to notice that the nest is settling down despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are putting new branches on top, and the bottom layer is already torn between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for the family of Aistists who nested in the yard every year, bringing out and feeding three or four chicks in the summer, but you do not want to be without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm regions, Anya's grandmother called the Tsarichansk RES, which owns the support.
And I didn't even expect to see a reaction that fast.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still standing, - said the technical director of DTEC "Dneprooblanergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
The wires, which were actually inside the 150-200-pound nest, began to corrode.
Birds could die from an electrical discharge at any moment.
And the locals risked being left without power because of the wires.
So the linear mounters started a nest rescue operation, which is not the first time in our practice.
The scientists-ornitologists from the Dnepropetrovsk National University helped develop the nesting scheme.
They've been doing training for the district network.
The famous Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised the energy workers at all stages of the nest reconstruction.
First, we estimated that there were more than 50 "apartments" in the area in a state of emergency.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were welded, resembling a funnel.
The foundation was laid with rope branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as a foundation for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
And then the A'is will build their own dwelling.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka in the Novosibirsk district.
A new concrete pillar was placed next to the power station and a platform with an old, already occupied nest was placed on it.
The whole operation cost the energy workers 9,000 UAH.
And the other day, a similar settlement took place in the village of Ivanovka in Petrikov district in the yard of my grandmother Ani.
The platform here was fixed in the same place, just lifted over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds won't even notice that their "apartment" has been renovated in the spring.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected to take place in four more nests in Pokrovsk and Tsarichansk districts of Dnepropetrovsk.
By the way, while some rescue rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
The day before, the whole region was struck by a sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka in the Apostolic district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers shot a family of swans living on the local pond for fun.
The noble birds were not afraid of humans at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and four beautiful swan children were already dead on the water.
Now the police are investigating who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular
On November 4, the Day of People's Unity, a "Russian March" will be held in Moscow.
According to a survey by the Levada Center, support for the Russian marches is growing - already 40% of citizens approve of the idea of holding them in various degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens approve of the Russian March in various ways: 11% of them are definitely positive and 29% are "quickly positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is growing gradually - in 2006 only 14% of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010 the holding of such events was supported by twice as many citizens (28%).
"Certainly negative" to the "Russian marches" is only 7% of Russians, "quickly negative" - 19%.
Another 35% have not been able to articulate their attitude to the action.
This year, the Moscow city hall agreed to hold a "Russian march" of up to 15 thousand people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital Alexei Mayorov said today.
This nationalist action has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
To the question of sociologists "Have you heard that on November 4th in Russia "Russian marches" are held under the slogan of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of citizens answered in the negative.
Now only one in five Russians (20%) knows about this campaign .
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 about the "Russian marches" were heard by almost a third of citizens (31%).
Recall that three years ago, on December 11, a natural nationalist rally took place in the Manege Square, which turned into a mass riot.
The Levada Center also asked Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (the Day of National Unity) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of the population is going to celebrate this holiday.
About the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the October Revolution Day on November 7.
Most citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow's mayor coordinated the Russian March in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was reported by the leader of the "Russian" association, the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march to Lublin on the Day of Popular Unity, a rally and rock concert of the band "Colorate" will be held, also agreed with the authorities.
How was the Russian March 2012?
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, nationalists marched from the Yakima Riverfront to the Central Artist's House, where a rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the number 6 thousand.
Message: Obama 's pre-election staff was considering excluding Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton .
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton's candidacy in the 2012 election.
This discovery is the most exciting of all of Mark Galperin and John Heilman's highly anticipated book on the 2012 campaign, "The Bets Are Doubled: The Game Is Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book, and reported Thursday evening that the president's closest aides conducted "large-scale focus group research and public opinion polls in late 2011" to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help lift Obama's faded hopes of re-election.
According to The Times political commentator Jonathan Martin, the book details the attempts of senior White House and pre-election staff officials, including former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to assess the effect of appointing former Secretary of State Clinton as vice president on the vote.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago pre-election headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, former Obama campaign chief of staff Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book "Dubbed Bets" claims that Daly was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their close personal relationship, but ultimately refused to take the step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the ballot would not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been an active advocate for a lot of things, and this was one of them", he told the Daily.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what are we going to do?"
While Daley described the study as a "necessary verification", Martin told CNN rep Anderson Cooper that the campaign staff had invested heavily in whether the move would bring a vote dividend.
"Pre-election staff don't spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they're serious about something", Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN he asked Daily if his then-boss knew about the possible move.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that Obama might have known.
Martin added that "The Double-Table" does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political scanning reached the Obama desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed Obama was unaware of the possibility of expelling Biden from the ballot.
"Maybe", Martin said.
You want some ice cream lit in the dark?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first ice cream lightened in the dark with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific paper on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate a glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person eating it, increasing the pH of the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that because ice cream shines when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Eat Me, I'm Good, says, "It's an amazing thing, but it's still in the very early stages of production, so for £200 you get about two grams of the substance".
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it raises the pH and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it to Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
It's pretty good to taste.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of gold.
But his next work must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream".
It's not possible by definition because of the breakage caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
"Avangard" coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about preparing his team for the regular season championship match against "Salavat", noted that the omics had thoroughly analyzed the defeat from Magnitogor "Metallurg".
The specialist stressed that the "Avanquard" should pay more attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Magnitogor's Metalurg, "the official website of the "Avantgard" quotes Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of spikes, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of their game failure.
We knew the rival had performers.
Statistics show they had five strikes on the move, three holes.
It's a very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparing for today's game?
The guys and I are going through every game, talking after the game, getting ready for the new opponent.
The key is to get the installation working.
Everybody saw the first half of the game against Metalurg.
The game was played, and the score was 2:0.
They missed the goal in the locker room and started to make mistakes in the third period.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in putting the defenders in.
We have to defend the whole team.
Now, the Avengers have a long home series, the game's in a day, and the team's tired?
All teams are in the same situation.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and complete the game.
Hockey is an emotional game, and if you do the setup, it's not that difficult to solve.
Because of the new rules imposed by Russian customs, hundreds of fur have been in line for almost a week at the border with Russia.
Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install biotwells
Hundreds of fur were piled up at border posts when entering Russia.
This situation arose because of changes in customs clearance rules.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is creating a queue, which has not warned of the innovations in advance.
From October 28, Russian customs authorities began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the deputy head of the Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
The checkpoints are on a powered-up mode.
A FACT correspondent visited the border and spoke to the truckers who were hostages.
Prices at the coffee shop at the Novoazovsk pass are rising every day, like the vans.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The customs terminal Novoazovsk - Velo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transportation routes from the south of Ukraine on the international motorway.
From here, the cargo is sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, the rules were introduced, and they were still in place until midnight, complains the truck driver Alexey Golovanov (pictured), who is transporting goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan via transit through Russia and has been staying in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, I need an extra set of documents and a payday loan to cross the border.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance it is being transported.
The minimum insurance is 4,5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who travel to nearby (say, Georgia, Armenia) with cargoes worth up to 50 thousand dollars pay about 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and travel.
And the rest are stuck, because nobody has that much money with them!
Imagine if a driver was carrying a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but he had to pay 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) for the transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - no - are being complained about by truckers who have settled down to eat near their cars.
Border stores and cafes are always expensive, but we've never seen prices like this!
The sellers were quick to cheer up: 15 hryvnias for a can, seven hryvnias for a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias for a plate of soup.
And the coffee shop is alone.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, go to the bathroom.
Not washing, not shaving...
I can't get out of my car for a week, my wife's been all over the road.
For a week, another truck driver, Viktor Skotarenko, is comforting himself.
Will my car be in line in a week?
Why do you have a gallon of water? We're interested in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnia.
What, a crystal bottle or silver-pressed water?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while you have more, the seller bets.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the attention of the authorities of the region was drawn to the disaster situation of Ukrainian drivers.
The administration of Amvrosiyev and Novoazovsk district state administrations has been instructed to provide drinking water to all those standing in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration Sergei Dergunov.
Now, the emergency services are on duty at the checkpoints.
Biotvales will also be installed for people's convenience.
According to the official, the problem of queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk regional government, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were parked at the international "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk" passports.
The FACTS will be watching the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanian and Eastern partnership countries - such a statement to the BNS agency made in the department of state security of the republic (DGB).
This information is published on DELFI.
According to the report, Moscow is going to "talk" with Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to facts from the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the intelligence service, the department of analysis of public processes of the administration of the president of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries is preparing the information attack.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania several times and participated in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also a participant in the operation is a department employee V. Smirnov.
According to the special service, Smirnov regularly visited Lithuania under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smyrna is banned from the country.
The day before, Lithuanian President Grybauskaitė said she knew about an information attack.
According to her, the main reasons are Lithuania's successful presidency in the Council of the European Union and "the country's aspiration for energy independence".
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She said that the Kremlin was "not respectful enough" of Lithuania.
In addition, Grybauskaitė accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of making "one demand only" on Lithuania.
Recall that in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk to Russia.
The quality of the products is not in line with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Lithuania's leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country's government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, a school principal shot teenagers.
The principal of one of the American high schools literally got the teenagers down.
The man, he said, was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident happened in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw toilet paper at the man's house.
The school principal opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and hand of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the thugs were not on the director's property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on $125,000 bail.
Shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible thing.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in downtown Ridgecrest, California, right across the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of a car and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting occurred at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
Shooting at an American school: 14-year-old girl wounded
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlont, Georgia.
Two people were injured, a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and make a masquerade for our neighborhood.
I look more like a squirrel now.
I haven't been called up to hand out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won't be this year.
But the statistics show I'm a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Retail, most Americans, or 158 million, will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent on costumes will go to the costumes.
This year, the top of the fashion is sexual non-animated items.
Women no longer have to be representatives of sex professions; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies through Walking Dead, and I'm sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will be on our Instagram this year.
According to Google, the costumes they're most searching for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we're not small.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, ice cream, milk duds, chewing gum Twizzlers and Clark Bar candy.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-craving kids who are preparing to take over our neighborhoods.
Besides, we're gonna buy and we're not gonna fool ourselves, we're gonna eat 90 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat is corn-grain candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, nearly 35 million pounds of candy is sold on Halloween.
That's about nine billion individual corn kernels.
It's a mystery I've yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween more than a haunted house.
They have amazing names, like "Fear Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is a real prison), "Woe and Scream" and "House of Shock".
And, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, and those amazing photos where you almost described yourself, which your friend posted on Facebook and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees that photo and leaves a comment like a "class face" expression.
And finally, let's talk about the carrots.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Oak when we were kids, and carving Jack's candle is like decorating a Christmas tree, which is something we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the baby carrot fashion only started last year with Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting those carots, not sitting on them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lightning flashing slowly on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want to do more difficult tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting something out of their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
Estonian Defense Ministry website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The Estonian Ministry of Defense website has been restored after the morning cyberattack, the ministry's press service reports.
According to Timar Peterkop, the vice chancellor for information and administrative affairs at the Ministry of Defense, this was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our specialists quickly set things right, and the site is back up.
"The damage done to the ministry is minimal", Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it's too early to tell who orchestrated the attacks.
"We will certainly analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents altogether", he admitted.
On November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted a message confirming the hacking attack on the Estonian Defense Ministry website and opposing the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO members.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are for an independent Ukraine.
"Keep your hands off Ukraine", Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the Marine Corps of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps will participate in the NATO Response Force Command and Staff exercises Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Because of the violence , several schools and hospitals have been closed .
Four schools in Zimbabwe's southern province of Matabeleland were forced to close because of student attacks by... Goblins.
According to a local elder, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue the study.
The story of the goblins may sound like a child's fiction to the European, but in Africa it's a pretty serious argument for closing schools.
Adults are afraid of the unclean forces, too.
For example, in the summer, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because of the fact that the medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
Land Rover series is announced
Inside are race seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and car storage between events.
Drew Bowler, the CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally participants who are appearing at Bowler have changed.
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try out different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, and to prepare participants for the harsh conditions and realities of rally racing.
We've been delighted to develop the Defender Challenge car. It's going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces know nothing about the "Brotherhood Circle" group
This is what INTERFAX.RU writes with reference to an informed source in the Russian law enforcement bodies.
"After media reports emerged that the US Treasury Department had placed Leps on the watch lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brother Circle', we reviewed all databases, but no such group was found", the agency said.
He believes that the spread of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which is supposedly operating abroad.
As reported earlier by NI, yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department published a list of alleged members of the Brotherhood criminal group on its website.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He's listed as "Grisha", posted the day before.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name - Grigory Lepsseвридзе, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth are given.
Besides Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another ex-USSR citizen whose nationality is not indicated.
The US believe that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was transporting money for the bandits on their orders.
The message is accompanied by a photograph of the singer and all his data that correspond to the truth.
Besides, Lepps actually bought a house in Phuket recently.
The agency said it intends to impose sanctions on Leps.
The US Treasury's blacklisting of a person means blocking his assets in the US and prohibiting business contact with individuals residing in the United States.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications were received from the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the Grigory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States".
All Lepps knows is the media.
He hasn't been notified in person, although I don't know if he's been notified in such cases.
"And of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other hand, surprising and unexpected", she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps doesn't live in Phuket, but, as the US Treasury Department claims, he does have a house on a Thai island.
She said that Leps was on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news caught him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Running out on the field in a "Shinnik" match
Some details about the identity of the fan who ran out on the field during the match of 1/16 of the final of the Russian Cup between Yaroslavl's "Shinnik" and Moscow's "Spartak" have become known.
According to the head of the Russian Federation's KDP, Arthur Grigoryanz, citing the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Moskovite.
He's under arrest at the moment.
"In addition, Grigoriantz told how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this one, let's call him the spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He went to the ambulance, the ambulance doctor confirmed.
And then he pushed two escorts away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South stands to the corner of the East and North stands.
He ran through the whole field.
The stewards are responsible for that.
Before the sports law came into force, this was the steward's zone - the police couldn't interfere with what was on the field.
He ran to the podium, climbed through the East podium.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern tribune and on the runways", the head of the KDC said.
Recall that the decision of the Moscow "Spartak" will host the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit" without spectators, and will also pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire crews were called in to rescue a stray puppy who was trapped 50 feet above ground in a dangerous career retreat.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after being in a minor accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in a quarry, and a man noticed her walking a dog.
Firefighters have come down a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky enough to be rescued after firefighters were called to pick him up and take him to a safe place after he somehow got stuck at 50 feet on a dangerous slope of a steep slope.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being in a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from a career on Wednesday.
Her owner, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were desperate to find their missing dog and posted a social media post after she ran away to a career after a minor accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog owner spotted Ruby stuck at 50 feet in a career slump.
A technical rescue team from Clekhiton Fire Station rushed to the scene, went down on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a transfer to lift her up the slope.
Rescue Specialist Officer Andy Clayton said she was in a dangerous position.
It was right in the middle of a steep slope, 50 feet up to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during the rescue, she froze completely.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that they noticed the dog is incredible.
Rescue Specialist Officer Peter Lau said Ruby was lucky to be rescued.
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and it was determined that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was scary to watch the rescue.
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing to have her back in our hands.
The vet said if she fainted and passed out, she'd probably fall.
The fire department was great.
It was very brave what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson of the town of Kitley added: "We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there.
The fire department was amazing.
I just can't believe she ended up there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rock star, and she said, "He played with me when I was 18".
She added: "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.
In a statement Thursday, a spokesman for 70-year-old Jagger said he categorically denies ever hitting on Katy Perry.
The spokesman added: "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else".
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kervan: breaking up with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another independence scarecrow.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
There's a lot of stories about passport control in Berwick and the barbed wire border along Adrianov's shaft.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although  predictable  this did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU Member States spend a lot of time trying to reverse their formal rules as they see fit.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continuing to default would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So this is not a story worth telling.
And it's so old that it's become a fossil: I first heard the rumor that independence means passport control, at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost in the telling of an ancient tale.
Why should an independent Scotland obey orders from Europe?
Why change the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Parties across the European Union opposing the EU or abolishing the euro as a single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the party of eurosceptics founded this year alone emerged out of nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the September federal election, effectively expelling the Free Democrats from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on national economies by maintaining a single currency, have led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments operating in excessive budget deficits, which was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members from exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-existing disadvantage in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way to save is to cut wages and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are caused by a deeper problem of Europe's productivity.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, the French and German energy companies are subsidized by consumers, and European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralyzingly unfavorable price situation, as we've seen in Grangemouth.
No freeze in wages in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap shale gas in the United States over the European petrochemical industry.
The result is a riot, especially in France, once the fiercest supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the ruined economy of France in a dire predicament.
The result is that the right-wing anti-EU party, Marine Le Pen, has just won the crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote timely warning British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split between the right will automatically affect the left.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and the single currency.
If the anti-EU parties are supported in these elections, it will be the first time that such a bloc has been able to dominate the European Parliament.
My view is that the rapidly growing anti-EU sentiment and anti-European currency sentiment are coming together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become again something like the vague Europe of nations that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I suppose Britain is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain is likely to be left unattended by the cold Atlantic.
What is Scotland's position?
We can choose to become a region of (actually) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to thrive under a more free-market European agreement provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, having won an overwhelming majority of votes in 2011 thanks to objections to the spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturation: aging early
African-American and Latino girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts, studies show.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is near
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the trigger mechanisms for early sexual maturation
The tendency to early sexual maturity is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter starts developing breast implants and bald hair at age seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and are a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents, "that usually doesn't mean full-blown sexuality is coming soon", Caplovitz said.
Obvious developmental signs, such as growing breasts, lobular and submucosal hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there's been only a small shift in age of the menarch (first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the monarchy, said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early sexual maturation in girls: how to deal with this common problem.
Time is the most accurate way to check how the sexual maturation will progress.
There is debate about what constitutes actual sexual maturity, but it is considered premature when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to age 8.
In most cases, the process slows down or stops. This is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster progression may be a basis for an endocrinologist to test for serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone ageing, which can eventually lead to slower growth and lower growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental level, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is wary of medication, but admits that suppressing sexual maturity can soften the behavior problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers.
Another big problem is that parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they're going to handle their hygiene issues", Kaplovitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many theories about the causes of early sexual maturation.
Yet there is no consistent evidence that the hormones in milk or other food products, the chemicals in the environment, or the sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, are more likely to reach sexual maturity early.
Kaplovitz argues that the most weighty prerequisite is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls ages 6 to 9 that linked body fat to sexual maturity.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early sexual maturity seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have hair on their faces and foreheads at a younger age, the tendency toward full early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of dandruff and dandruff is common even in infants and young children.
"We must be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Gorrieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy about receiving instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
It could mean an earlier than expected conversation, Kaplovitz explained.
If you keep calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who are blooming early need confirmation that even when it happens prematurely, it is a normal part of life.
American Boeing trapped in Cheetah preparing to take off
The American aircraft, which conducted observation flights over the Russian territory under the Treaty on Open Skies and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Wednesday, November 1, will leave the city's air harbor at 8:30 Moscow time.
The airport management has given permission to take off the plane, having received the money for the fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will be flying to Ulan Ude.
Other reports say he's heading to the United States.
The plane was reportedly flying to Ulan Ude and landed in the Bay Area due to fog.
He was not released from Chita airport due to unpaid bills.
The plane is carrying 30 people, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, people on board an airship are not allowed to leave the Chita airport, they can only pass border control at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and is a treaty with 34 states.
Observation flights are conducted over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The Treaty's main objectives are to develop transparency, facilitate the monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, and to expand the capacity to prevent and resolve crises within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities make ?
The 2013 list of the highest-earning celebrities is headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was overwhelmed by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 was $160 million.
He is markedly lagging behind by other celebrities who have died, who have earned several times less last year.
The second-highest-paid celebrity on Forbes' annual list was Elvis Presley, who made 55 million a year, and Charles Schulz, the comic book creator of Peanuts, with 37 million.
In addition to the top five, Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million) were among the top five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein were also on the list.
The first boutique of Igor Gulyayev opened in Moscow
On October 23, the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyayev was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyayev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now more fashion fans can appreciate them - his first boutique has finally opened in Moscow, and the designer has organized a dolce vita party.
I'm sure that the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
So I'm especially glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's a part of me.
With these words, Igor cut the red ribbon and invited anyone who wanted to try the beautiful models!
Jet makers are fighting over seat width when orders are high.
A fierce dispute erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute has been about the width of seats available on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, with the amount of space allocated to them playing a key role in the claims about the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide seating widths of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main American competitor Boeing says airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of larger and larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21 potential record orders are expected.
The rear of the aircraft  especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row  is central to the economic performance statements of new minibus projects .
Boeing claims that its upgraded 777X will seat 406 people, based on economy class seats over 17 inches wide, arranged 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch seats arranged in nine rows.
The aircraft giants often exchange technical blows with professional press advertising.
Airbus is now speaking directly to the public ahead of the Dubai air show, where the 777X is expected to lead the way with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be by showing the financiers a slide showing three people in a restaurant clinging to each other, called "Would you agree to this?"
Boeing offers long-haul flights on smaller seats than regional turboprop aircraft,  said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
People gain weight as their diets change, but plane seats haven't changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of an average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist circumference of those recently called "reactive audiences" was already.
Airbus says it ordered a study that shows that an extra inch in width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is challenging Airbus' seat sizes and says manufacturers should not interfere with how airlines balance fares and amenities.
She says research shows that comfort in the living room is not just about the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed", said Kent Craver, a Boeing cabin specialist.
They don't want us to decide what's good for them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is increasing the space on the sides, but for suppliers, it's increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
The race to get orders for aircraft worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices over the next few decades is enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating arrangement is what fuels the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent increase in profits per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul models compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER, the market leader in this segment.
The Boeing characteristics are based in part on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat 777 design solution.
The profit in the cost-to-pay ratio is reduced compared to the 10-seat compound currently in use.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our designs", said Kevin Keniston, Airbus' European head of passenger comfort.
On the other hand, analysts say that the full 10-seat saloons for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense layout that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
"The eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial standpoint, Airbus's offer is driven by the threat of the 777", said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
World-wide jet salesmen even carry roulette wheels to check out competing layouts.
All manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense cabin layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus is offering a 10-seat A350 but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had emphasized the need for additional modifications to the cabins, offering wider passenger seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of another major modern aircraft manufacturer, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but it could distract from the 777X sales wave.
New nicotine vaccine could deprive smoking of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine could protect mice from a lifelong nicotine addiction.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Yale Cornell Medical College in New York City said the first results were encouraging.
"We are very hopeful that this vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the techniques available on the market today, but have found their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome with these modern means", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce nicotine repellent antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were later given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that weren't vaccinated relaxed, which is a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be made so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine will likely be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette to prevent nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to quit.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't get the pleasure from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of that habit", he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Olaynikov: one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region are fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of Moscow Sub-District Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements in Moscow region are fully subsidized
In total, 187 of the 288 settlements receive subsidies from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, while 83% is subsidies.
Within the framework of budgetary security, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget", Oleinikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three towns - Mytišt, Odintsovo and Pushkin - have a budget revenue of more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "it is not enough".
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Moscow is over 70%, "with the same decline in the quality of services", Oleinikov noted.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of the municipalities of the Moscow region to think about which settlements need to be enlarged, incorporated into urban districts or change the administrative management system until the end of November.
These proposals will be worked out by the end of January.
Before that, the governor of Moscow region had stated that as part of the administrative reforms in the Moscow region, it was planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
In addition, in the Mojai, Kashir, Solnechnour, Kolomensky, Lubertsa and Kotelnikh districts, there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Moscow State Duma, Igor Bryntsalov, also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Moscow are planned to be united in the framework of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is because of the fact that less than a third of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region have "acceptable" financial bases, and 100 have subsidies.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina is not hiding the great pleasure she enjoys raising her children.
Although Arbenina spends much of her time in creative and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to hang out with Martha and Artem, not only studying them but also having fun.
In the past week, Diana has twice reported on her teaching talents to her fans.
She first posted a photo on Facebook showing her teaching children to read.
And yesterday, she was a fan favorite, showing off how she dressed Art and Martha for Halloween.
"Our first Halloween is ready for the brass race!" - so Diane called a picture of her children in holiday costumes.
Which is unfortunate, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are involved in this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "unspecified sex" in child registration
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of hermaphroditic children to be changed to "unidentified" instead of male or female.
Parents will have the right to leave the "sex" column on the birth certificate for a period of time.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents can temporarily write "X" (uncertain).
This decision is designed to prevent parents from rushing into sex reassignment surgery.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphroditism.
Tripodie denies being influenced by Obeid.
Former New South Wales Labor Secretary Joe Trippody will be the subject of an investigation by the state's anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripody denies the change to the lease order of offshore properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three real estate properties on state land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to extend the lease on the Sercular Key, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without a tender after their expiration in August 2005.
She's now investigating allegations that Mr. Trippody knew of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in real estate after testimony by former Deputy Chief of Staff to Mr. Trippody Lynn Ashpoole on Thursday.
For several years, the government has insisted that the lease be put up for an open competition.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer rental terms.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the Sercular Ki enterprises, which brought the Obey family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without being put on the open competition.
Mr Tripodie, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodie acknowledged, had urged changes to the government's rental policy.
The ICAC's decryption of the phone calls included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Port Ministry after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
Was the question discussed in these phone conversations a question of developing commercial lease policy? Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley asked Mr. Tripodie.
No, Mr. Tripody said.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not what it was.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a senior official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets inside Syria.
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 rocket.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel has launched airstrikes on missile cargoes inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for authenticity
The 457 class visa test is currently under review by the government, as it intends to expand repressive measures.
If passed, this test will be applied to criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas for unqualified positions or as a loophole for moving family and friends to Australia.
The government's submission of the document for discussion was released today, as former Labour MP Maxine McKeo criticized the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners' at the end of the line' and 'Australians start work' are a very unpleasant setback to the times when unions demanded a protected labour market,' she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected, and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document outlines 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday meeting officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the proposed changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the authenticity criteria are accepted, the applicant for a visa can be examined for authenticity of the application in the case of a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or person involved in the financing of the enterprise.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of subclass 457 visa holders, as previously, enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with the refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man's sadly deceased nine-year-old son accompanied him on his journey to Australia, and since his father died on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semena Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semen Varlamov, Evgeny Vavrynuk, said he was suffering from alcoholism.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking", the woman said.
It is worth mentioning that Vavrynuk filed a lawsuit for beating Russian national team goalkeeper Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair, and also beat her - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came to Denver police with a confession and confessed to the beatings, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on $50,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete from traveling around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Wawrinuk.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study to improve the economic impact of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed connections with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of Phase One in 2026
Baroness Kramer, Minister of Transport, said the project would unite Britain.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was excited about the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first stage will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements to the railway's capacity and reductions in travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim at HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer together.
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we're facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it's also about city transport connectivity; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better communication thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alister Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to unambiguously support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK".
We are therefore pleased to work with the UK Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow to Edinburgh railway line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to discussing the results of the study with the British ministers next year and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
Tory is the new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world are still thinking about how to meet their energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (wherever they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear energy is costly, but leaves behind a lot of waste that is expensive to recycle.
Scientists have recently turned their attention to thorium, another radioactive element in the Mendeleev system.
It is found worldwide, and experts claim that its fragmentation does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for using electronic devices on Australian aircraft will remain in force for now
Australian airline passengers will still have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite the US's relaxation of the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they remain in "Flight Mode".
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many are annoyed that they don't have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Administration also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
The Civil Aviation Safety Administration currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft, it said.
This is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times and passengers to  observe the safety rules that crew members inform them of.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority expanding the use of its Wi-Fi onboard entertainment system, has not objected to the changes, but said it will follow the regulator's instructions.
"We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Board to consider the issue of authorizing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve customer service now that it (the onboard wireless entertainment system) is on our planes", the press secretary said.
Qantas has stated that it will abide by the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no plans to change them anytime soon", she said.
The FAU's ruling applies to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be closely investigating the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft is resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage rules and passenger instructions.
After the airline checks and confirms the resilience of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any altitude, the FAU said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, the group recommended that heavier devices be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during takeoff and landing.
The head of Dagestan will hear the songs of extremism in the Kubani anthem
The football match between "Angie" and "Kubany" resulted in a political collision between the authorities of Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after fans burned the flag of Dagestan, and Kubany's anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramzan Abdulatipov, on Thursday proposed to the republican parliamentarians to go to court because the anthem of Krasnodar Territory allegedly calls for ethnic strife, in particular, calls for war with the "basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, it was in our time in 1995 that this anthem was approved.
It's a shame, and no one does it.
"We are going to the death fight, remembering you here as a mother, an enemy, a basurman", - why write such words in the hymn, poison some believers on other believers, - expressed solidarity with Abdullatyov, the chairman of the parliament, Hezri Shiksayidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from overseas, namely, from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has launched a strike on Russian-made missiles that were reportedly aimed at Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition: to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement reached through Russia that allowed the United States to avoid a military operation that they came close to this summer.
More about the weapons and what it means for the Syrian president will be told by our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington has said the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August of poison gas.
And the punishment has come.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend Vladimir Putin made.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is a big milestone.
A group of international experts said Syria had shut down its claimed chemical weapons factories.
A more long-term and more difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
We know it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days are numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when.
He's not legitimate anymore and he should leave.
But Assad is staying.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are dispersed and ill-armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons deal is a diplomacy success, the inspectors are awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself is a man who is willing to cooperate.
Today, the US ambassador to Syria in Washington has had to answer some difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is hardly relieved that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is holding.
And he switches weapons to power.
President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of construction and housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry overseeing construction and housing and has proposed to lead it to the former governor of Ivanov region, Mikhail Menyu, during a personal meeting.
The president met with Mikhail Men at his residence in Novo-Ogarjevo, and Men refused to head the new department.
Russian President Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of the Region.
Mikhail Men - the son of the famous Orthodox priest and proto-priest Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
From 1995 onwards, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow regional duma from the Sergiyev-Posad district, was a deputy of the State Duma, first deputy prime minister of the government of the Moscow region, deputy prime minister of the government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of Ivanovsk region.
Singapore lobbyists are doing well, while the middle class is struggling.
At a pawn shop in the Bendermir shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirtha Linga puts on a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put into it", says Mrs. Amirthaaling.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is growing  is such that ValueMax, where it is trading, has become the third lobbying firm listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
A jewelry mortgage loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 for Mrs. Amirthailing) but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Normally, lenders in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent  slightly above the 15.4 percent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same trading center.
However, the advantage of a pawnbroker is that it does not require credit checks or proof of salary and can lend faster than banks.
So millions of people across the region are turning to the lobby as families feel pressured by rising living costs and the rapid rise in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans fueled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to the pawnshop to compensate for declining incomes as their economies slow.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cited the increase in the family loan shoulder, largely due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80 percent of GDP compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will be looking for ways to supplement their income wherever they can", says Song Seng Won, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices in the last two years have increased the rush people are putting their personal belongings on the line as they take advantage of the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items in the city-state's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put the gold chain on Grandma and get it back next month".
In Thailand, the largest lobbying operator EasyMoney has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months.
The growth in the retail business is such that ValueMax, which operates a branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yaah Li Ching, ValueMax's chief executive.
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week from the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked criticism over high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the lenders not only offer cheaper rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Clients are putting in items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn't increase household debt", she says.
The bet is gaining wider public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured financing.
And it's not just the people who are in financial difficulty who use the shelters.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax stores to bet on gold bullion or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary financial difficulties", says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, the population is not concerned with the number of medical facilities and their status, but with the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the "Modernisation of healthcare in the Tulsa region for 2011-2013" programme, the reorganization of medical institutions in our city will create an optimal structure for providing medical care to the population, including the gynecological patients, pregnant women and women giving birth.
Thus, after the merger with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the "NGKB" state-of-the-art hospital to consult pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved, modern equipment was created, which corresponds to world standards.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the capital repair of premises, 112 units of equipment were purchased for the sum of 42 million rubles.
The newborn fast is equipped with the most modern equipment.
In the operating room, a cesarean section is performed using a Cell-Sever apparatus that allows blood to be collected from the operative wound and returned to the woman after a special treatment, avoiding blood transfusions.
The clinical-laboratory diagnostic department is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women's counselling office has an electronic registry, and in the near future, it is planned to introduce electronic maps and patient medical records.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it has become possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, pregnant women and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens are being arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the Caucasians.
The gang reportedly ordered prostitutes to one of the hotels in Strasbourg, then beat and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old woman who was previously convicted of Chechnya.
Bayern defender David Alaba was Austria's best player in 2013, according to the Bundesliga's official website.
In this dispute he outnumbered the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirsher, and the third by ski jumper Gregor Schlirenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, the German Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Former wife of Arshavin rests with actor Andrei Chadow
The former civil wife of Peter's "Zenit" footballer Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya is on holiday with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is in Italy with the actress Anastasia Zazdorojna, her fiance - the figure artist Sergei Slavnov, and the actor Andrei Chadov.
The photos from the couple's walk were posted on Anastasia Zodowna's Instagram.
This isn't the first photo of Andrew and Julia together.
On October 5, the company posted a photo of the couple hugging on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarov.
In mid-October, the "Zenita" club, Andrey Arshavin, admitted that he lives separately from his civil wife, Julia.
We will remind you that Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
It was recently reported that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to a top corporate executive.
Save measures package of $325 million for healthcare in Tasmania
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania's weakened healthcare system will be supplemented by strict conditions that ensure the state government doesn't waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "temporary measures" to prevent the crisis caused by the island's aging population, higher levels of chronic diseases and systemic limitations.
The decision to fund the four-year project was made after the government consulted with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilke.
The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will address the specific issues facing the state, Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a planned operations flash campaign.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help you cope with the lag.
There's also money for hospitals that take patients without prior registration in Hobart and Lonsetone to improve the quality of post-hospital care, train medical professionals, mental health services, and introduce personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
These investments will be based on the ideas expressed by leading doctors on how to better help the healthcare system in Tasmania,  Ms. Plibersek said.
The minister insisted that the Tasmanian government would work in a strict accountability and accountability mode.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive the Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million would be a no-brainer unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put Tasmania's healthcare system on a more sustainable footing.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for emergency assistance, which he first addressed to the prime minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the recovery of this state's health care system from a critical state", said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional selection procedures largely compensate for recent cuts.
But federal health adviser Peter Dutton believes today's statement is a "resolution similar to a leukoplasty".
"The reason we're here is because the state's Labor government has taken $430 million out of the health care system", he told ABC TV.
When the state government is spending almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth is investing 300 million, you can't pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional red tape.
The filming of Giom Nichols' novel by Danny Diderot may boast of exceptional production and historical detail, but it's also more difficult than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, the film tells the dark story of Susanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic realist and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never gets down to vulgarity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
Because of its seriousness, storytelling risks becoming a hairdresser's test for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, says the monitoring group
Syria has destroyed its main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the facilities believed to hold toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began in the country nearly three years ago.
The statement of the Chemical Weapons Ban Organization was made one day before the
The deadline of 1 November, set by this Hague-based organization, is for Damascus to destroy or render inoperable all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with poison gas and fill ammunition with them.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying its existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin gas.
The statement came during fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safir, which experts say is the site of a chemical weapons production facility and storage facility, reports the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Centre.
A group of activists who tracked the casualties through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government militants and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2202 army survivors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a UN estimate dated July 25, 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
That number hasn't been updated since.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting rebels in Safir for weeks, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but it did not give any specifics.
The fighting highlighted the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors as they prepare to meet their short-term mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The WHO statement, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was now satisfied that it had tested and destroyed all critical production and refueling equipment claimed by Syria.
She added that no additional inspection activities are currently planned.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspection work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites Damascus has declared.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria's statement, abandoned and... items from the chemical weapons program contained in them were moved to other declared sites that were inspected.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safir was one of two places that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which should be approved next month by the OPCW executive committee.
"I welcome the courage and courage you all have shown in carrying out the most difficult mission this organization has ever undertaken", said the observer group's director general, Ahmet Uzjumju, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has been placing rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against Assad's government and his security forces, which are members of his Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
As for other incidents, the head of the center, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger at the verdict on the terrorists in Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the conspirators who appeared in court and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the creation of the explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He can be released for 15 years if he gets parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounded dozens more.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including the wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a man dubbed "explosive" for his reputation as a master explosive device maker should be sentenced to death.
This decision has compounded the painful memories of June Courtin, a Perth-based mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack by Patek and his associates nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He's got to appear before the firing squad, Ms. Courtin told AAP.
I must live every day knowing that I will have no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into operation, parked outside the van, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives, just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times while connected to the life support system.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islam responsible for the bloody massacre, Amrozi, Muḥlaṣ and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
This guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone.
Saving his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali terrorists to appear in court.
He was in hiding for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American troops killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that the intelligence evidence indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish ties between the terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
He didn't give up, Mrs. Courtin said.
Until recently, he had no regrets about the pain he had caused others.
The verdict came on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year", says Mrs. Courtine.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not on mobile phones)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones,  according to the long-awaited new guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is implemented will vary by airline, FAU administrator Michael Worth said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and equipment lay-up rules to meet the new guidelines.
The FAU said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
 Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of electronic devices very soon,  the FAU said.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closed.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the best.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aircraft descends for landing and not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and steering, the FAU said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Grüling, president of the Professional Boaters Association, welcomed the changes.
After the new policy is successfully implemented (and we're going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,  said Gliding.
We're frankly tired of feeling like school-guards when it comes to this.
But internet access for surfing, email, texting, or data uploading will still be prohibited at altitudes below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to the airplane mode.
So there's still no "Words with Friends" of the intelligent Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when a rumored incident occurred: The actor was pulled from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was at the exit for landing.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be put in the luggage compartment, because they can hurt someone if they fly around the cabin.
Cell phone calls in flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory powers for telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
The FAU may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing .
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, the national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
 Cell phones  are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air,  Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAU to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been increasing on the FAU to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no sound security reasons for the bans.
Restrictions are also becoming more difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers  high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAU as electronically resistant.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of the liners are adapted for more widespread use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Warth said.
Today's electronic devices usually emit much lower-power radio signals than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when scrolling through pages.
But the signals get more powerful when the devices load or send data.
Among those seeking to ease restrictions on passenger use of electronic devices was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded an entire plane with their Kindle e-book readers and flew it to check for problems, but they never found them.
Members of the FAU advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Association said he believed the interference from the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only individual reports from pilots confirming that the devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those reports are very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during landings on instruments under limited visibility.
A group of travel industry representatives welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible step toward passengers who now use a variety of technology devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security", said Roger Dow, director general of the U.S. Travel Association.
Autoschools will be able to conduct exams for driving licenses
Private companies with their own computerised drive-in can take the driving licence examinations.
This is reported by Kommersant, citing the draft government resolution "On the admission to driving vehicles".
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such auto-drums in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" driving schools will be counted on the results of internal testing.
The State Inspectorate will monitor the passing of the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the student space fail the first time, this school will be denied privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the autodromes contained in the draft government decision come into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for teaching two-wheel drive.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass the city traffic test to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, the companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian permits after passing the exam.
A bird sent to safety from a North Sea drilling rig is released back into the wild
The bird, which was airborne to shore after being found in a depleted state at an oil tower in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was put on a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month, and then was taken out by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the Alloa Rescue Centre.
Colin Seddon, the centre's manager, said: "This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has been caught in the strong winds over the North Sea".
It seems the bird has weakened and found refuge in the oil tower.
He added: "She was unable to fly again, so we were called in for help".
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the aim of bringing together business representatives and identifying the changes Britain's wealth and jobs makers want to see in its relationship with the EU.
To do this, we've ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders representing a broad range of businesses across the UK by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than waste time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU's complicated institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general discontent with the single market, with business representatives stating that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the European trading zone,  even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed.
Our latest and most significant business survey revealed that the vast majority want Britain to move towards a treaty change and a trade-based relationship with the EU, not a policy one.
This result, which has been seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business is pushing for a significant change that will bring the powers back to the UK.
High stakes  achieving a treaty change and more favourable terms for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in voting to remain in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to review the terms of the UK's membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business expects the review to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and as our survey results show, for businesses this means a greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels' regulatory activities.
U.S. intelligence services are wiretapping Pope Francis ' personal phone .
The Vatican's activities are under the watchful control of the U.S. intelligence community.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection indicate that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all of Pope Benedict's previous negotiations, and is now closely guarding Pope Francis.
His phone was tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The election of a new pope was also under observation.
Which was given special importance in the United States.
The special services have connected to the cell phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose the next pope.
The phones of the residence where the participants of the conclave lived were also being listened to.
American spies were listening to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of a figure unwanted by Washington.
Panorama magazine reports that "the great ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the conclusion of the Conclave on March 12.
It is said that in the United States, since 2005, the Argentine Archbishop Bergoglio has been appointed as the future Pope of Rome.
American intelligence was also monitoring the negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that a secret CIA and NSA operative group is still working at the US Embassy in Rome, extracting information about policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, has peacefully declared that it is not concerned with American "wiring", even if it is.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the US leadership.
Snowboarder for the Olympic ticket photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative note dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The notebook was 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already making a lot of irony about the memorial note.
After the Olympic banknotes were presented on October 30, they noticed that the image of a snowboarder with a banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular, the StockExchange photo storage is free, and the photo dates back to 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website MegaObzor on January 18, 2011.
It's also been used in RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic note is made in blue-blue rubber.
On one side, a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and the Hot Bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and trampoline jumping, but eventually snowboarding was chosen because it was a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public's opinion about the widespread use of the image of the snowboarder with the Olympic note and is currently studying the situation.
But the State Bank isn't too concerned about the noise around the Olympic note.
The head of the press service of the State Treasury, Natalia Nikiforova, told Izvestia that all the rationale for plagiarism is ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the bill will be turned right, the photos on the net will be turned left, Nikiforova said.
The person on the photo shoot to create the note was photographed from different points, then the final image was selected, on it - the typical pose of the snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic note, as the artist received a salary for his work.
Experts say the debate around the Olympic bill is positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill is a plus for its promotion, according to the executive director of the Russian Brands, Alexey Popovichov.
It's hard to prove that the images on the bill and in the photo banks are 100% similar, so intellectual property lawsuits are unlikely to go to the picture.
The first Olympic note appeared in China - a 10 yuan commemorative note was issued for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to uphold this tradition.
Legislative bans have made Russians drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
They say the country's beer consumption will remain the same next year, at best.
Although the businessmen initially expected growth.
This year is a bad year for them, sales down 7 percent.
This was reported by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Tovars of daily demand in Russia", which just ended in Moscow.
It was about government regulation of the market.
Between 2008 and 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, as the country has seen a significant increase in regulation of the beer industry in terms of beer production and circulation - a drink with little alcohol content, she told the audience.
No country in the world has such a strict beer market restriction, the unpredictable introduction of all new and illogical bans that are supposedly based on the fight against alcohol abuse.
Beermaker noted that many legislative bans designed to reduce alcohol abuse have little effect, but new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The biggest blow to beer producers was the ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks.
"We lost 35,000 consumers at once", said Isaac Shepps.
The brewers have two forecasts for next year.
The optimistic one is the one that Shepps was talking about: sales of foam will stay the same.
Pessimistic, they'll drop another 2-3 percent.
To save their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from the mass consumer variety to the premium class: beer will be less but more expensive.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet apparent.
"I observe that the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level", Dr. Alexei Sotnikov, a drug specialist, said.
True, the proportion of patients who consume substitute strong drinks and those who "sitting" on alcohol-containing tonic drinks like "yaguara" has increased, whereas ten years ago, "beer" alcoholism was the dominant cause.
In September, 600 people were fired from Ford's automobile plant in Vsevolodsk.
As the unions say, all the fired were compensated.
However, far more acute than the problems of workers, the question of reducing industrial production in the region arises.
The deputy of the regional Zaks, Alexey Etmanov, said that the factory of Ford in Vsevolodsk was cutting about 600 people.
He said that this happened in September, when about 600 people left the factory under the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the union.
Workers who voluntarily resigned were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs voluntarily.
However, according to Etmanov, such a large number of people is a night shift.
I don't think that's all that matters.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support the region's businesses in difficulty in the next two years", he said, adding that the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction in jobs.
Ford doesn't deny or confirm this information.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it comes out, we'll definitely publish it.
Talks about cutting workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolodsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company announced plans to fire 600 people in September.
The plant had previously announced that it would stop producing cars.
The factory was named as the reason for the decline in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, the volume of industrial production in the Lenoblast decreased by 5,4% in the nine months of 2013.
The production of transportation and equipment has decreased by 11.5%.
In the US , you can use your cell phone when you take off and land an airplane .
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing have been approved in the United States, reports the BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with new rules coming into effect by the end of 2013.
However, internet access to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometers.
Because of the danger of interference with the radio equipment of the aircraft, mobile voice communications will still be prohibited.
Passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos on domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are passed, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they can handle the alleged impact of mobile on aircraft technology and aircraft controls.
According to the source, the United States could also see a revision of the current rules for electronic devices in flight.
The Russian mafia has finally established a new name in the United States: "Brotherhood Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the Russian mafia in America has been filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department has inducted three Russian, two Uzbek and one Israeli citizens into the "Brotherhood Circle".
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, who is suspected by the United States of transporting money for the members of the group.
The U.S. blacklisted 22 people associated with the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
Yet, many experts question the existence of such an organization.
"The Brotherhood's claim is more like an attempt to unite the various criminal groups", said organized crime expert and New York University professor Mark Galeotti.
In his opinion, the "Brother's Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization", Mr. Galeotti is quoted as saying by the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
I agree with Mr. Galeotti and George Mason University professor Liz Shelley.
"If they are working together, it's more like a criminal network than an organization", she said, quoted by the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In mid-July, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brother Circle" was more closely linked to the Russian thief in the law by Aslan Usayan, known as Dodd Hassan.
The criminal authority was murdered in January of this year.
Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakharia Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Dede Hassan, and another list participant, Temuri Mirzoev, was Dede Hassan's nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals have no connection to Usuian.
He said they were all linked by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer, Grigory Leps, in the "Brother's Circle" has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to get more detailed information from our American counterparts, in connection with which such a decision was made, why he was included in such lists, - said the spokesman for the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a Russian citizen.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Gazprom head Alexey Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the Southern Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
"Today a landmark event has taken place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the Southern Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun", Gazprom chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
The Southern Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds most of Russia's gas destined for Europe, increases the risk level for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated forever.
Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the Southern Stream at a reduced price once the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The pipeline's annual projected capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Police arrested a shooter at Los Angeles airport
Police arrested a suspect in a shooting at a Los Angeles airport.
Earlier, it was reported that a rifle was fired at one of the airport's terminals.
Police and rescue services evacuated people from the building.
The assailant was wounded in a shootout with police, no identification.

Two YMCA employees have been charged with sexual offences before Jonathan Lord was charged, the Royal Commission has learned.
Two YMCA NSW staff were charged with child sexual offences before the 2011 indictment of Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse reported.
But the commission's opening statement said it had never been involved in sexual abuse of children within its organization.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hayer was asked about one case when a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case when a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA also admitted inaccuracies in the committee's opening speech, claiming that there were external YMCA checks that acknowledged that the YMCA was at the forefront of child safety.
The submission of the certificate suggests that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second of four final assessments based on the results of the quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower management made mistakes in hiring Lord and failed to provide staff with a clear understanding of his obligations regarding reporting child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare has rejected the suggestion that YMCA's corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with the children, personally caring for them, kneeling them, saying he loved one of them and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Daniel O'Quell, who was under Lord's guidance and asked to be taught child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnett, the childcare manager at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's manager, very scary and often hard to reach.
The CEO said he doesn't accept employees' explanations that they felt embarrassed to report the situation to their top executives.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord had led them away from the idea of reporting him.
Mr Hare said he had presented his opinion to the New South Wales YMCA board that the lesson to be learned from the Jonathan Lord incident was not to provide information from staff, and the board agreed.
Mr. Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA's child custody director Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent evidence from being damaged, but it was overblown and poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not safe for children by the organization during Jonathan Lord's work there in 2009-2011 years, said the commission's child abuse expert, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University.
He said there were serious problems recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearing is postponed to December 20.
It's fashion week in Sao Paulo.
She's not just a model in her homeland, she's a real star.
Although Giselle Bundchen quit her job for a while to focus on motherhood, she came to the party on a special occasion.
Her absence for months did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest-paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the Kolchi brand defile.
The fashion week finale is usually the most interesting show.
Looks like it was arranged by stylist Lino Villaventura.
For more than 30 years, the brand has been producing luxury-class pret-a-port, while the designer is active in theater and cinema, designing performances and designing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 companies and companies involved in the textile industry and the world of fashion took part in the final fashion week in São Paulo.

Tony Blair has said he will take the chance of returning as UK Prime Minister, but admits that a return is unlikely.
The 59-year-old politician spoke in an interview the night before on the fifth anniversary of his resignation about various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his commentary to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East peacekeeping force.
Asked if he would return as prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely to happen, so ...
Milan's head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the result of the 10th round of the Italian championship against Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure in the start was due to a series of injuries to leading players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win", Allegri said.
The team played a good game, creating 3-4 good chances.
We didn't let Lazio do anything in the first half.
The second Romans added, but overall I can't say we lost focus.
We had to win.
Last season, we did our job of getting into the Champions League.
We're behind schedule right now, but it's because of a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
But we're still good.
Look at Kak, who held a high-level meeting.
The horse racing experts who travel to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the arrival of a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just months before taking his first steps, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony Toffey had to run through three rounds to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 of his adult rivals far behind.
This indissoluble pair  of equal height  received high marks for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnibank Horse Sports Centre in the town of Radry near Cardiff.
He came out into the public eye against the backdrop of men and women in fancy hat-fitting hats, he moved his hat upside down and proudly walked around the circle of two-year-old Toffee.
The judges praised Fenton for his unusually developed innate ability to deal with horses.
Toffey got the highest score for appearance and character.
Fenton was given Toffee for his third birthday in March last year, and since then he's been training with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great duo".
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffey, and we were all thrilled when he won.
The people who were completely unfamiliar with him in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This boy from the village of Nanthiglo, near Abbe Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "The whole audience was shocked, and everyone was shouting applause and clapping.
He ran on the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals. He loves horses, tractors, farms, and he has two chickens to take care of.
I'm guessing from how he started, he'll be competing in the Horse of the Year soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A representative of this annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony".
They're a great team together.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffey for their looks and how they presented themselves in the show ring.
They're judging the performance of the pony and the breeder. Fenton and Toffey were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the recall is subject to reorganization.
The Chinese newspaper, which published a first line call for the release of the accused in defamation of the reporter, should be reorganized, the press regulator reports.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes for writing false articles about a state-owned company.
Now the new express must go through a full error correction process, the regulator says.
The order to correct the errors came from the Guangdong Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's newspaper New Express published several false reports about the Zoomlion company listed on the stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
The New Express editorial board has been disoriented, the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that it has been decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yunzhou in the form of revoking his journalistic license.
He also directed Yangcheng Evening News Group to correct the mistakes in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation of the newspaper's officials and immediately make changes to the New Express' management.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he reported financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two calls for his release in the front row, saying it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television admitting to publishing fake articles for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust", he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confessions, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, saying the paper failed to properly verify his reports.
Several high-ranking suspects recently made a televised confession.
Experts say that the practice of confession-kicking is still common in China, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to confess.
US-Mexico drug-transfer tunnel discovered with its own railroad
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials described this four-by-three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex underground tunnels they've ever discovered.
This tunnel, which has a zigzag length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near the cities of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (United States).
This area is filled with unmarked warehouses, which makes it easier to smuggle drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were passed through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they discovered the tunnel.
Three men who were reportedly drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life in prison.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the marijuana harvest in October, which put the drug cartels on a difficult task of quickly delivering their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard stretch of track with railroad tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
In Belarus from November are increasing pensions
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November this year, the head of the Pension Supply Department of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection told a correspondent of BELTA.
From 1 November this year, the average wage of workers in the republic will be adjusted, with a 5.4% increase in the amount of pensions applied, and the corresponding recalculation of labour pensions will be carried out in accordance with the decree of 21 October 2013 No. 478 "On the Increase of Pensions".
As a result of the recalculation from November, the average age pension will increase by 5.3%.
The average pension by age will be Br2 million 295 thousand .
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million people in the republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274,3 billion per month.
At the same time as the recalculation of labour pensions in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, surcharges, increases and surcharges to pensions will be recalculated in connection with the increase in the budget of the living wage per capita average.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, from 1 November, the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and surcharges, increases and surcharges to pensions will be increased by 2.1%.
In Belarus over Br53 trillion was invested in the payment of pensions in 2013 .
British police handing Assange a release notice
British police today handed over a release notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who had taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had handed the 40-year-old Australian a formal demand to surrender with a demand to appear at the police station, adding that if he failed to comply with the demand he would be subject to further arrest.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his powers under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would turn him over to the United States, on June 19, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, seeking political asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard has handed back an official surrender order to a 40-year-old man, requiring him to arrive at the police station on a day and time of our choosing, a spokesman said.
He's still violating bail terms.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible espionage charges after more than 250,000 US diplomatic envoys were published on the anti-secret website WikiLeaks.
Driver driving 130 miles an hour with hot drink between his legs fined £1,000
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving at speeds up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to drink between his legs.
In the Colchester International Court of Justice, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driver's license resulted in him being banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 in costs and an additional £100 in aid to crime victims.
A tax on foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst.
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who introduced a 7% state duty rate in the 2012 budget for homes worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own houses in a partnership rather than as individuals.
At the moment, the residential property tax in the boroughs of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which was £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, is already above the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook stated: "After the increase in the state tax on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is low regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system".
But this move could lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy real estate in London or to current owners not wanting to sell it, he added.
The value of first-class real estate  top 510% of the housing market at  price in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but were eclipsed by the rapidly developing domestic market with rising prices in the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs whistle their tail to the right (from a dog's point of view), while anxious dogs whistle their tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can notice these subtle differences in tail bites and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigaro, a neuroscientist at Trent University, says: "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain of humans are involved in different ways in the formation of the stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions".
We've tried to look at this and other species here.
He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of the brain that controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the various tail twists of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the animal's heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Valortigar said, "We showed the dogs dog videos, either naturalistic versions or silhouettes, to get rid of any other distortion, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail further to the left or right".
When animals saw that the non-expressive dog was moving its tail to the right (from the dog's tail point of view), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was tilting mostly to the left (again from the dog's tail-wrenching point of view), their heart rate slowed down and they looked anxious.
Professor Valortigar said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other using these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience which movements they should be concerned about and which they should not.
He notes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and often the tail twirling in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side is less friendly behavior, the dog reacts based on that experience".
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a deeper understanding of their pet's emotions.
John Bradshaw, a dog behaviour expert and visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's veterinary school, said this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides were relevant to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a contented dog.
In another study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported that dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail twitching was left-handed rather than right-handed, instead of becoming anxious.
He said the differences could be because dogs in various studies didn't fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It might be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
"While there is ample evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes in different mammals, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point one way and sometimes  the other.
Arctic Monkeys are postponing their Glasgow concert because of Alex Turner 's illness .
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed their Glasgow gig after their vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This cheffield band was supposed to perform at the Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, vocalist Alex Turner's illness forced them to postpone the show.
The band's statement came after they were forced to postpone their gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical attention, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Hydro Stadium in Glasgow on Friday, November 1".
Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately, he's unable to speak.
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets to these shows remain valid.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will be elevating the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are 201 cardinals at the moment.
However, after reaching the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the papal elections. This is the prerogative of the group of 120 cardinals-electors.
Announcing the news, Vatican press secretary Father Federico Lombardi said that before the sanctification ceremony, a gathering of all current cardinals will be held, known as the Consistory.
Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate planning for other meetings with cardinals from around the world, Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals elected will likely drop by February.
He said that usually the pope names as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals electors back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The consistency next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
There is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and Italy in particular.
It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance, he said.
South America is home to 40 percent of Catholics, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected since the formation of the Franciscan Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it's possible that Francis would go to the cardinals for advice.
But we've never been in this situation before.
Valero said that the popes usually elevated the office of cardinal by bishops from major parishes, but Francis is a surprise-loving man, so we don't know who he'll name.
GM is recalling a number of new pickups in the U.S. to refine the seat backs.
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address manual seatback tilt adjustment issues, according to a notice from U.S. vehicle safety regulators on Friday.
Some pickup trucks may have a defect in the back tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet federal safety standards for vehicles.
In the event of a rear-end collision, the driver and passengers may not be properly protected, increasing the risk of injury, according to a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM pickup began production in June and is the most important launch of the car into series production for a leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported the defect to truck owners in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider a notification to owners due to the 16-day government shutdown, which cut sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model lineup, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.

Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me through the depression of my sophomore year of medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It's called "Dalie for Victory", and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my patient reports tonight and go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could capture the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and the newscasters paused to make sense of this historic moment.
My classmates cried out in tears of joy, and my parents kept every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
The return is a rough awakening, like a dream come true.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism. They seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, things have really changed.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied accomplishments, from passing the Affordable Care Act to withdrawing our troops from Iraq, repealing the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" rule, the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health options, and the closure of the Guantanamo base, among others.
But after countless times I've sided with the Obama administration, defending it from colleagues and peers, I'm out of explaining things I can do.
I've reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism can't explain allowing foreign leaders to be tapped or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It can't explain the collection of data about Americans' private lives by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing.
He can't explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without a trial and investigation or a failure to meet the limits of public funding and spending during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's conclusions that the White House's efforts to silence the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And recently, he has been unable to justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have realized at the age of 18 that leadership can contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, running for office is not a predictable agenda, because our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events like the Newtown massacre.
However, from all the examples I have listed above, it is clear that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was so excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a vague and rude alternative, he seemed incapable of making decisions on his own policy or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freeing himself from the pressure of the next election, would justify the hopes we've heard about for so long.
But when Obama's rating fell below 45 percent this week, it was much harder to get back to 2008 with this book.
It makes me long for the many promises that have come true.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton deafened Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At the failure analysis meeting, he told his staff that they should return to normal and stay true to their goals.
I want us to get our appeal back, he said.
We must remember who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of childcare leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement as he tried to avoid questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding to cancel taxes on carbon emissions and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that a conflict of interest could only be with ministers, and said Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not", said Mr Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the race for a seat on the Sunshine Coast of Fairfax electoral district with a 53-vote margin after counting.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting process to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on this election be made two months after we vote?
"We need a more advanced system", he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system that allows us to come in, enter our data into the computer, vote right away, and get a result at 6:30 that same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil seems strange these days.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his program includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job very seriously.
Public office involves service to society.
"We seek no reward except to thank history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment", he said.
RBS is removing two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its currency operations unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged currency market manipulation is gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be fired in the ongoing investigation that echoes the scandal surrounding interbank LIBOR manipulation.
The bank declined to comment on the suspensions, but confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
Our current investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators, the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people familiar with the matter said that RBS had passed on the records of emails and instant messages that its former trader received and sent to the UK regulator  Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and as far as we know, he's been granted leave to take his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, took a leave of absence this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was fired from his job by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's instant messaging team included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to people with knowledge.
UBS Bank said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies around the world  The European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust body Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are considering allegations that bankers have colluded to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks look at instant messages and emails over the years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news of the scrutiny has been a stir for traders in the business, which has been one of the biggest sources of revenue for investment bank retail divisions in recent years, but this year has been plagued by low volatility in currencies that has reduced favorable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the situation by saying that a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that's not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading on the forex market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that you can start to influence the market for a very small price.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired one of its stockbrokers from the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused nearly $6 million in losses late last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue was localized,  Credit Suisse reported.
Supreme Court upheld Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
Voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that individual provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional in accordance with the government's tax powers.
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy opposed.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further ruled that the health care law's requirement that states increase compliance with Medicaid or they lose all federal funding for Medicaid is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
Each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season was strongly opposed to the law, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Is football the reason for the difference?
At the State Duma, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was to ban football in the North Caucasus because of the scandal and the differences.
Speaker Sergey Narishkin recalled recent events in Biryulov and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in society" policies and media should be correct in their statements.
He probably meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to restrict births...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples of Russia, which gave the discussion a tonic.
Maxim Grigoryev said that the events in Biryulov were "a model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and instances to answer these questions", and seven nannies have a child without eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced in relation to migrants, has, according to the public, failed and we must find our way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes in a new, unified history textbook.
"We need to create a textbook on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa", he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed criminal responsibility for "calling to dismember Russia": "If you tell the radio in the United States that you should give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky was very trying not to "burn".
As usual, he blamed journalists who bring sick and acute national issues to public discussion: "In the heat of controversy, there is little to say!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to sign a charter and agree to conduct talks on the subject carefully, and then politicians can take on the same commitments.
We have about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the general order is established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
He cited a law that places responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for international peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share her enthusiasm about this law: it does not have "clear ideas about what adaptation of migrants is, its mechanisms and limits.
So the subjects will have different interpretations of the scope of these powers.
Besides, municipalities do not have the necessary personnel to solve such complex issues, they do not have the resources, and the methodological recommendations they can use, the center does not give them...
Head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Hajimeet Safaraliev, proposed to create a special department with the dreadful name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who headed the similar agency in the 1990s, which was later abolished, opposed it.
It's enough to have a federal-level special agent, a "minister without portfolio", who you could contact if you had anything.
"We are walking along the edge, shells are ripping at each other, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support", said the representative of the RPC for relations with society, Vsevolod Chaplin.
He believes that there should be no state neutrality in regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Oleg Nilow took the discussion to an unexpected turn: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan need to be found, but they are being pushed on the wrong path, not the right path", he said.
"The wrong way" is the development of football: "The player is beaten by the whole crowd, the flags are burned, the teammates throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that football.
There's another sport called rugby.
"There will be no one like them in this sport!" the proverb said.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus!
You're gonna offer them a curling!
You have to know the national characteristics, it's like offering the Georgian "Zaporožets""...
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club were wildly behaving on the stands - during a game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the control-discipline committee of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryanz, said that the "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, according to the Football House correspondent Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the stage during the home match of the 14th round against Angi.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a man from the Russian Football League.
We've been looking at all the materials available.
For the wrongful conduct of the audience "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei are suing Nortel for patents
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's former patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, which it beat at auction for Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match keywords searched on the Internet with their corresponding advertising, the lawsuit says, which is the foundation of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running Android from Google, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered a $900 million initial price for Nortel's patents.
Google has raised the price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, with Motorola's patent library partly a determining factor in the deal.
Despite an unsuccessful bidding attempt to acquire the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,  the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt's first freely elected president takes oath
Muhammad Morsi takes the oath, but the day of his ceremony is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Morsi promised a new Egypt when he took the oath of office, becoming the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life of absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability", said Mursi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years was a banned organization targeted for the harsh actions of alternating governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived with a small corps shortly after 11am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to greet the new president, and unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak's time, the movement was halted only briefly to allow his motorcade to pass along the usually busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Moursey was ridiculed as a non-charismatic "safety wheel" by the "Brothers", his personal reputation has grown sharply since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to end the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", Morsi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, told the judges in the sewn-out wooden panel room where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performing the national anthem, during which he stood on the stand smirno.
The military figure, Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi, was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan Army and people  one hand, which was chanted by hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and promised to restore the powers of the president, who had been stripped of his office by a military council that had taken action from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath of office before the court rather than the parliament as it is, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen region took place at the Yalutory Automobile Plant.
The event also saw the launch of a new line of steel electrical welding pipes.
As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov told, in 2011 with the arrival of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market for the sale of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turns out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of cooking pipes a month.
After that, the decision was made to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of products have been shipped.
The investment in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
A new plant was launched in October, which allows for an increased range.
The factory produces both small pipe profiles, which are used for heat-personal farming, small construction forms and in the furniture industry, and large pipe profiles - for the construction industry.
We plan to produce 50,000 tons of produce a year, which is about 10 percent of the consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the change in activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is re-training staff and selecting the necessary specialists from existing staff.
Next year, a new steel cutting unit with a thickness of up to five millimeters is planned to be introduced, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another plant with a pipe production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the plant will be developing pipes for housing and communal use.
The company's management is aiming to cover up to 70 percent of the Tyumen region's demand for this product.
Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department Leonid Ostrumov, addressing the heads of the manufacturing companies, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of the machinery manufacturing enterprises.
This is also the case with forms of state support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and leasing costs.
This year, 150 million rubles are planned for these purposes, two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission to consider subsidy contracts will accept documents from enterprises by November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of local producers participating in international fairs.
For the coming year, the budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for the fair, 3 million for energy saving programs.
The amount of money spent on the oil and gas complex in the south of the region is reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostromov, in the future this form of support will cease, as the motive for its introduction was to compensate the oil companies' tax on mineral extraction, which was paid into the regional budget.
They don't do that now, and subsidies are becoming a direct spending obligation for the region.
In view of this, the regional government considers the direct support of industrial enterprises as a priority, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
The budgetary assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the situation with oil workers.
The subsidies for the equipment they buy are a competitive advantage for the industry of the south of the region, and when they are cancelled, it will be difficult to compete with the middle class of Russia, where the labor force is cheaper.
In addition, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-VR - the company "Rosneft", which has not yet placed its orders in the companies of Tumen, is unclear.
The agreement to implement the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no applications have been received for its extension.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains open whether the taxes on oil produced in the Uvat district will be paid to the region's budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic will spend 240 hours on a social media video
The Tomsk district court sentenced a city resident to 240 hours of forced labor for posting extremist videos on social media, a spokesman for the regional court's press service told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on a popular social network that was added to the federal list of extremist materials.
He was charged with crimes under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliating human dignity committed publicly".
"The Lenin district court has considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of committing the above crime, imposing a sentence of 240 hours of forced labor", the agency said.
She added that the man had fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in the prices of goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov believes that prices in the country will drop significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers on his Facebook page.
I can say with certainty that prices are determined by a number of factors, including customs.
So once the agreement is signed and the Free Trade Zone comes into force, the level of customs duties on EU imports will drop significantly.
And that would mean prices would have to go down.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries", Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct as to be indirect.
But still, there shouldn't be any price increases either.
Therefore, the reports on billboards, which have recently appeared in our country, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, this is not quite the case, or more accurately, not at all", Azarov concluded.
Investigators are checking reports of child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media reported that a teacher at a kindergarten in Biysk had locked a child in the basement.
Investigators are currently investigating the circumstances and giving a legal assessment of the children's activities.
After being accused of obscenity , Evgenia Vasilieva spoke up .
Evgenia Vasilieva, whose personality has received media attention for almost a year, has never commented on numerous press publications about the abductions of the Ministry of Defense, or her personal relationship with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the Defence Service violated her silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva stated: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly the same: to get any negative information about the former defense minister out of me".
It was blackmail about me giving evidence or I'd be in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We'll go to court next, prove our innocence.
We're 100 percent sure we'll win.
In this interview, it can be concluded that perhaps the most important thing Vasilyeva said was that her taste was not important.
It is likely that this refers to the statement by the official representative of the Russian Federation's S.K. Vladimir Markin that the collection of paintings collected by the defence services' case representative was a forgery.
Among the seized property are a number of paintings that the housekeeper, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artistic expertise appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings has established that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap counterfeits", Markin noted in early October.
Some of the paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from the Department of Defense, and they said I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal matters?
I think it's just a mess", said Vasilyev.
When asked whether she admitted to one of the 12 criminal episodes she was accused of, Vasilova said: "Of course, no.
There's nothing to confess.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the Russian Supreme Court that Vasilyev is avoiding studying the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the victim stated that he and his client "the investigator does not let him get acquainted with the materials of the case".
What led to the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest and has not yet spoken to the press?
Maybe how could she not answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or the right-wing "Komsomolka" journalists who claimed a few days ago that she "fell into an even bigger trance under house arrest" because of news of Anatoliy Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family plot?
A well-known military commentator of the Communist Party, Viktor Baranec, wrote in his article "Is Serdyukov Back with his Wife?" "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative in interrogation".
Previously, Vasilieva was charged with illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.
The pre-winter troubles.
What to do in the garden before the frost starts
Fungicides are best used in the fall for copper-containing preparations, such as 1% Bordeaux mixture or the Abiga-Pic, Oxyham, Ordan, and other drugs.
Do you think the Internet has gotten the travel agents back?
Flight Centre seems to be seeing a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year earnings forecast and expects record returns from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The tourism firm now expects its primary full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with a previous forecast of between $305 million and $315 million.
If current targets are met, this would be a 1217 percent increase over the record $290.4 million profit in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre made 8 percent profit in the first half and started the second half with good results, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the UK.
"We've been working with profits in our 10 countries since the beginning of the year, and some of them are expected to have record high profits before interest and tax contributions for the full year", he said.
 This includes Australia and the UK, which are usually the biggest profits to us
In Australia, leisure business has recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for the slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Her U.S. business has made up for losses during the seasonally weak first half, and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
On October 31, the Barnaul police identified two gambling halls.
The first worked in the Industrial District on Vzletna Street.
There was a game at the time of the check.
The club counted 24 machines.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 slot machines in this place.
The Russian Interior Ministry in Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been prepared under the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling".
The tech's been taken.
In the near future, the materials will be sent to the industrial and Lenin district courts.
In Yekaterinburg , a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, police are looking for a criminal who brutally dealt with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to "New Region" in the press service of the Russian Interior Ministry's State Department for Sverdlovsk region, two women were found dead in the Kirov district of the Ural capital on the eve of the fire after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Ural Street.
Soon the identities of the dead were established.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them - a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years old, the other - 33 years old resident of the Orenburg region.
The burned apartment was rented out a few days ago.
His investigation was personally controlled by the region's chief police officer, Mikhail Borodin.
Internal Affairs is working on different versions of the murder, checking the alibis of former convicted citizens and individuals inclined to commit such acts.
It also determines the purpose of the women's rent, where they lived before, what they did, who they had relationships with.
Schools are urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School English courses will require students to study at least one of Shakespeare's plays, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and modern British literature beginning in 1914.
The exam will also feature extra-programmatic texts to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined English language and literature course will be cancelled.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to take a separate language examination, with strong recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due to release new English and Maths curricula tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
He'll be making changes to other major subjects next year.
A separate OFQUAL exam regulator will present a revised structure for the secondary school exams, with a new assessment system and less coursework.
Speaking this summer, Education Minister Michael Gow said that there was "a broad consensus that we should reform our examination system to restore public trust", insisting that the school exams would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students spend about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on the math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school math exams combined with a higher score in the ranking table would likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional instruction in the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on real-life tasks, including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Haïhe will cost tourists 2 200 rubles
From tomorrow, from Blagovestensk to Heihe, tourists will be transporting airbags.
For those who want to go to China, it means extra expenses.
A ticket for a pump is traditionally much more expensive than a heat truck.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of the usual ticket will be 2 200 rubles.
The cost of traveling through the hall of increased comfort will be 2 800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets didn't get any more expensive: the same price the tourists were transporting the pumas last spring, and a year ago - in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate of Russia is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of Russia's GDP to be insufficient and believes that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We've been planning a GDP growth of about 3 percent this year, maybe even a little bit more.
It's actually going to be a little under 2%.
In the context of a general recession, some European countries seem to be not bad, but it's not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as some countries are, and generally, to develop, we need to have higher rates.
It is very important that Russian companies and Russian businesses get normal loans at normal prices - this is the first thing that must be done", the head of government stressed.

He's easily wounded.
Traveling through mud, rivers and jungles to get free medical care
Dr. George Bvelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend taking in hundreds of patients.
In this West African country, there aren't many doctors. Only one in 5,000.
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. George Bwell is one of CNN's top 10 characters of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 leading characters to be CNN's Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his remarkable work.
For 21 years, George Beavell has watched his father come back to life and fall unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not equipped properly to help him.
Jamef Bvelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that resembled his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", George Bwellle said.
If we had the money, we'd have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Buell spent years escorting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
It's not easy, Buell said.
You can leave your house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people may die because they have to wait.
Things haven't changed much since Father Bwell died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the United States has a ratio of  one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of every five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending is private.
"Their only problem is poverty", said Bvelle.
And because of their poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his countrymen, Beauvalet was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwell and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital of Yaoundé.
He also founded the nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others load up vans, tie up medical supplies to the roofs, and travel through the intersection to visit the needy in the village.
They don't always have luck.
They had to push cars across rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: a celebration of songs and dances and the best facilities the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is truly a celebration, and Buwelle, with his broad smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade starts taking in hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on every trip", said Buell.
They come from all over the county within 60 kilometers of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get cremated remains, donated glasses, or free birth certificates  school documents that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school building, a municipality building or a home; patients get up and go to the postoperative area after the procedure to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light the operating and sanitary equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's a slow pace, but the intent of the brigade usually helps support the village musicians.
"They're playing drums all night so we can stay awake and keep working", said Buwelle.
On Sunday, the crew members head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can be of great value to those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he received to treat his hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family", the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, the surgeon Beavell also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaunda.
This second job, he said, provides 60 percent of the funding for his nonprofit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer with the Bwell Group.
He's either in the hospital or he's trying to raise money for the organization to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Buell in his mission, this is an opportunity for practice that they would never have at home.
"We were given the opportunity to assist with operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwell", O'Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicine.
But when they arrive in Yawnda, their food, transportation and training are paid by Buwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt", O'Malley said.
He's dedicated his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, being almost constantly busy is not a hard test.
Helping others live happily, keeping a promise to their father, is what brings them great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", said Buwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify about the Merkel interrogation .
The Bundestag member Hans-Christian Schrebelé met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the interview, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German prosecutor general in a case about the possible wiretapping of the German chancellor's phone by the US special services.
Snowden has expressed willingness to testify.
The meeting could be in Moscow or Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebel, that he knew a lot.
And even though the National Security Agency headed by Keith Alexander has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But first, we must define the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, American lawmakers are taking action in response to the scandal surrounding US spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill that would impose additional restrictions on the U.S. electronic intelligence service.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and fields.
This was announced to journalists by Belarus' foreign minister Vladimir Makei at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu, reports BELTA correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and fields.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the state governments of the two countries will provide all-round assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts", said Vladimir Makei.
He stressed that the Belarusian government will create all the necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also informed that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, and the protocol was signed.
The sides developed a road map of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment fields, in the spheres of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as at finding new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners", he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that at the talks, the heads of the foreign ministries of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, needs to be increased and brought to the figure of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be developed further, as there is unused potential in this area, he believes.
Our relations have always been very warm between our countries, and we hope that they will continue to grow and expand further.
All necessary conditions will also be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey", - said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to say anything about health care
Amid a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday broke his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving service discontinuation notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama slightly updated his initial public promise.
"Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it", he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called a "revival in the news" about the shutdown, Obama urged those receiving the notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to get better, more comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
You'll get more favorable terms, he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that 5% of the population who buy insurance themselves may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me tell these Americans straight and simple, you deserve better", Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the online sales platform has been going terribly badly since October.
"I'm upset and angry just like everyone else", she said.
I'm very anxious to regain your trust.
An angry Sybelius shouted this phrase, which was caught by a microphone on, to a deputy sitting behind her at a hearing in the House yesterday after a heated debate with House member Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she herself should be a member of Obama's health care program.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Sibelius to explain why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt Agency stripped of media status for censorship.
On October 31, the Mosgorod court ruled that the license to register the Rosbalt agency was invalid.
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of its media status for systematic and gross violations of the law on media.
The court found it possible to shut down the media, in fact refusing to give the publication the right to counterarguments.
What is a Rosebalt?
Rosbault Information Agency was founded in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbault has been developing and functioning as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was among the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbault has always had a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement.
Talks about the publication's proximity to the force continued throughout the agency's existence.
Besides the fact that Rosbault had a large source base in various departments, it was also suggested that the project was headed by Natalia Chaplin, wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the leadership of Rosbalt is not clear to the end: she is often called "the project manager".
The agency's general director is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbault has not been featured in the federal media ratings - neither in terms of citation nor audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the ranking of Russian media sites according to the LiveInternet version.
According to LiveInternet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular material in the last five months are notes about the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the "King and the Joke" group's soloist, pogroms in the capital Biryulov.
The conflict between Rosbalta and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on media came into force, banning uncensored gossip from journalists.
The agency found banned lectures in two videos published on the agency's website ("Gigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot contaminated the oil towers").
The next side is described differently.
Roskomnadzor, based on the video material found, accused "Rosbalt" of grossly and systematically violating the law on media and appealed to the court with the demand to withdraw the agency's license.
The Rosbalte reported that the complaints of the agency were unlawful: first, the videos were not editorial materials, second, the mother words were masked, and third, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
The agency's representatives appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor to the world court - and when the Mosgorsud accepted Roskomnadzor's claim on October 22, 2013, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th of the world judge decided not to "Rosbalt": the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code on administrative violations and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, that predetermined the outcome of the Mosgorod hearing - to say nothing of the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined earlier.
On October 31, the court ruled that the Rosbalt registration certificate was invalid, effectively stripping the agency of its media status.
You can't say that Rosbalth was alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by the deputies of the State Duma (the application on behalf of the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Jarov was signed by 26 deputies on October 10; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the KPRF).
The publication's shutdown was declared illegal by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even gave him some guarantees that the case will not come to the license revoked.
The Rosbalt court has shown that the question of which jurisdiction is safer for the media in Russia today is a big one.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has recognized.
This first phase of Damascus's disarmament was completed a day early.
By November 1, Syria was to destroy production facilities and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare combatant poisonous substances for use, reports the BBC.
The destruction of the poisoning stocks themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors have been deployed to Syria after a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 killed more than 1,400 people, according to U.S. data.
The main task of the inspectors was to keep the time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent repairs.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stocks of poisonous substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian claims will be thoroughly verified by Western intelligence.
They will be willing to recommend new facilities to inspectors if there is reason to suspect Damascus is not fully open.
The U.S. believes the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with an agreement reached through Russia - destroy or disable all the power plants for the production of shells, gases and liquids to poison and to fill the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the Syrian army's existing chemical weapons.
It is estimated that the arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agent poisoning, skin-slip mustard gas, and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
To destroy it, the OPCW and the Syrian authorities must first agree on a timetable - two weeks.
OPCW field operations chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched the equipment being destroyed".
"They now have no opportunity to produce or mix chemical weapons", he said.
The OPCW statement said that inspectors visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and found that the shell and poison plants were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The other two sites are too dangerous to inspect, the document says, but the equipment was transported and inspected by OPCW specialists.
Smith said the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was "especially difficult", as it was necessary to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, the inspectors had no time to celebrate because they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that US espionage has gone unsuccessfully far.
John Kerry demonstrated a soft defense tactic for U.S. surveillance programs by making an unprecedented acknowledgment that in some cases, U.S. espionage has gone unsuccessfully far.
The Secretary of State also pleaded guilty, along with Barack Obama, to being an autopilot during Edward Snowden's loud exposures of NSA espionage.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video at an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually perceived some of the things that were happening on autopilot, because this possibility already existed during World War II, and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, September 11th".
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage went too far, but stressed that no one's rights were violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this and explain it to the people, and he's doing a thorough analysis now to make sure that no one feels abused.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was acting in good faith and that his surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We're working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, a reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and killing people because we could learn about these plans in advance.
Meanwhile, American lawmakers will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop joining anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain our supporters of our common counterterrorism efforts", said Democrat Murphy, serving his first term as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism despite their anger at these NSA programs.
The news that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some of the US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the US.
Other disclosures included documents Snowden released that suggested the NSA was monitoring the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended espionage against the Allies as necessary and said it was a normal matter on both sides.
In the wake of the riot, Murphy said his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other lawmakers involved should be announced in the coming days.
He said the trip program was still in development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of "hardness from the best of intentions" would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about the spy programs they themselves have used for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the issues of hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence.
New members of the public observation commissions will have more influence from prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (PCO) can approve the new composition of public observation commissions (ONCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the vote is passed, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
The ONCs are the public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The case of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razovzhayev, the riots in the penny colony - through the ONK, most of the resonant incidents behind bars are made public.
There's a struggle between human rights defenders and law enforcement lobbyists for control of the NCO.
At the meeting of the Working Group on the formation of the UNO, I proposed that the selection criteria be the experience of human rights activities.
"He was not accepted and the lists were made without criteria", says Valery Borchhev.
Borchhev is the current chairman of the Moscow Observatory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the all-Russian body of human rights defenders involved in prison problems.
As a member of the State Duma from the "Apple" he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONK.
The OPC Council must vote for the ONC's composition in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand candidates are applying for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The O.P. promises to organize a roster for vacancies.
The Moscow NRC is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will be 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borchhev, the current composition of the capital commission consists of 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the variant that is on the ballot in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the capital commission.
But the new composition can be re-entered by the representative of the "Battle Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the ANC for three years, but never visited a prisoner.
Borchev believes that the force, having appointed its chairman of the UNO, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
According to them, the advance of the force is coordinated by the member of the UNO Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of the force.
"I don't eat babies for lunch", said Anton Tsvetkov of RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he didn't even care what list the OPs are voting for.
He considers the publication of Borch's information a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk NGO.
Her former bosses are fired over last year's coin riots.
The Public Chamber concluded that the local commission ignored the prisoners' problems.
But the Rostov-on-Don NGO can go from human rights defenders to law enforcement.
The local commission's chairman, a human rights defender, was "missed" from the new list, but one of his opponents was found, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
The lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions are considered by Borchhev to be "the place behind Kopeysk".
The revelations of Nadezh Tolokhonnikov did not affect the Mordovia NGO, which is considered "strong": only one human rights defender wanted to join the new body, and she was not even accepted for the competition.
OP council member Nikolai Svaniдзе told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is upset by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His colleague at the OPP, Pavel Gusev, says he voted for the proposal because he likes the Moscow list.
The lists of the NK were coordinated by Deputy Secretary of the Polish Public Service Vladislav Grib, also a member of the Scientific Research Institute of the Polish National Statistical Institute.
Grib told RBC daily that he did not think it was right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and law enforcement officials and did not agree that the chairmen of the commissions had enough powers to hinder the work of its members.
The fungus doesn't predict the outcome of the OPC vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against jail term in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for making a false claim that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of making a false claim by the Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells before trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a general detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, not a women's adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was extremely concerned about their daughter's well-being and were waiting for her return to Australia.
"It was obviously a troubling time, but we hope she'll be safe and home as soon as possible", said Tanks.
Bamford appealed her conviction and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently vacationing in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could lead to a court extending her sentence to two years and making her serve time in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourism image, leading to a verdict of not guilty.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris presenting his novel "Eltycheves", translated into French.
It was his novel that was a finalist for four awards: "The Plains", "The Russian Booker", "The National Bestseller" and "The Big Book".
And last year, the writer was awarded the Russian Federation's government's prize in culture for this book.
Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of thirty- and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his harsh, modern-day life-sustaining stories and novels has sparked heated debate among critics of various backgrounds.
It can be argued that the collected articles on Senchin's prose and publicity, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers", according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, the talk is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature", as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow the majority of articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere to be included.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviations in the sections "Absats...
