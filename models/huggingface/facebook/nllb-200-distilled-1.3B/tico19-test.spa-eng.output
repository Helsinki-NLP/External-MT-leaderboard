Accumulated incidence of rapidly increasing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve their preparedness for a wave of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a novel coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14%, COVID-19 progresses to a more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6%, develops a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each country in the European Union or European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the COVID-19 case counts reported in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK and to compare them to Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days; in this way, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days in EU/EEA and UK countries, in general, followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK exhibited similar upward trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in which countries are, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including delayed testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance data which focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 201011 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100 000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100 000 inhabitants in 201011).
Model scenarios for healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk > 90% of overcapacity of ICU beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
Since, so far, case clusters have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units, therefore, need to prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as is occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment to mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response appropriately if not implemented early.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed 3000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope this analysis will help us understand and eradicate this menacing disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home for the entire holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40 000 patients discharged and more than 3000 patients deceased.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is public enemy number 1 and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the virus sequence isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarise the progress made in research into this rapidly developing new material.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some crucial questions that remain unanswered.
Coronavirus have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we've encountered two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus in recorded human history.
As shown in Fig. Fig. 1,1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, infection of healthcare providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan city was put under quarantine and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the site of origin of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and to almost 50 other countries worldwide (fig. (fig. 2).2).
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic as described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected people were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 spread in conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The baseline reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
The envelope spike glycoprotein (S) binds to its cell receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion then occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 percent in 10 sequencing samples taken from the original outbreak site: the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With a transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 contains no known domain or functional motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the structure of human full-length ACE2 electron cryomicroscopy at resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can join two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and to have been transmitted to humans by civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96 percent identical to two SARS-like coronavirus from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the route of transmission remains to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long-snouted mammals that feed on ants and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99 percent genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference propagated by the totality of two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results providing concrete evidence are expected (fig. (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a disinfectant with chlorine, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel coronavirus.
No detailed study on immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced so far.
Consequently, we can only rely on previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
Generally, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Cooperative T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complementary C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence in clusters, most likely affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to have a higher chance of becoming infected than others.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt effective quarantine time to the most accurate incubation period; this will prevent asymptomatic infected people from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study from late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98 percent for fever, 76 percent for dry cough, 55 percent for dyspnea and 3 percent for diarrhoea; 8 percent of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by transmission from an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 population study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%) dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and in line with the higher lethality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%, when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, the SARS mortality rate for November 2002 was 10 % in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 population study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high and rising to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Conglomeration usually occurs within a family or from a single gathering or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from hospital may contract the virus again, an alarm sign that the time of quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in the peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of < 4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of < 1×109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase were observed in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was elevated and the lymphocyte count progressively decreased.
Anomalies are detected in chest X-rays of most COVID-19 patients, characterized by bilateral shadows or opacities in grinding glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction decreases surfactant levels and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings on chest X-rays are usually parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the scaling of pneumocytes, formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitium, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and of ARDS, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase-reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a rod graduated in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also experimenting with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table (table 2).2).
These therapies include treatments currently or potentially in use with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to see who develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus first.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as those in the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine storm is the result of an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous amount of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody to IL6 receptors, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T-cell-directed immune response; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period of time has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, given intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19, has been proven.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is high expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following lopinavir/ ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The drawing of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and they recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, this needs to be verified and clarified in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, potentially producing lethal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is normally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that code for effective antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to theories of MCT.
Most effective components remain unknown or imprecise, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used MCT in 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei Province, which used MCT in only about 30 percent of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13 percent).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WMD) treatment alone with combined treatment of WMD and TCM.
They found that the time taken for body temperature recovery, symptom resolution and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO-only group.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (mild to severe) was markedly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCT still await further well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more sites.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are generally very afraid of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delusions and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
They are essential effective vaccines to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and they are often complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live attenuated viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and the models of lethal stimulation and protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical trial can be started.
This is probably because SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
However, there are still sporadic cases and conglomerates of MERS in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (table (table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor in the SARS prognosis, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably older than those who did not require them (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictor of the evolution of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 vs. 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation between PCR level and severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict patient outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
They are therefore traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroid use was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, as in general, they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and other patients.
Providing psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients is essential to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, as is the case with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or in the incubation period may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which makes it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission was largely not occurring in the early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of stopping the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused considerable damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be over by March and the downward phase will last 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclical episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in feces, raising a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were likely caused by infections in hospitals, including 17 patients with other prior illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passersby in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to decrease the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 respirator (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from being airborne or from sticking to surfaces, from where they could be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can fully penetrate them; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear tailored isolation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear protective masks or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered an adequate distance for people to keep away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alarm in China due to its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020, that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly eased public alarm, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan was wasted.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this harsh lesson and make decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, as every word matters to citizens and can cause them to change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive in containing a possible epidemic in its early stages, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in implementing tailored and effective drills to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve society's response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated a sense of SARS reappearing.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91%, compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even if they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so when they are seriously ill, which makes it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to slow the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve as it spreads between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, go extinct like SARS, or periodically reappear like the flu?
Although it may take time, it is vital to seek the answers to these and many other questions.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought coronaviruses back into the spotlight and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sibling, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses originate in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of disease in humans.
Investigating interactions between coronavirus and hosts in animals could, furthermore, yield important information about the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with an emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and species-to-species transmission.
Notably, we compared and contrasted different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of single-stranded RNA positive viruses with envelope.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were named coronavirus because of their morphology, because of the crown shape they have under an electronic microscope.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins replicase.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of accessory proteins specific to each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus betacoronavirus contains most human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes for most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir for gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people, with a crude fatality rate of around 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The novel human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91 000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and not pathogens, but have great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and the constraining factors of the jump between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for preventing future spread.
In this analysis, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, species-to-species transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlighted and analyzed the common theme that human coronavirus parental viruses are not normally pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after species-to-species transmission to a new host.
We also examined the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the B814 strain of HCoV-229E from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the last decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial pass in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, caused the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the etiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, general malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, can also become infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open-air lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of choriosis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, with its peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory illness.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred from unknown causes, such as the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63 that was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional close contact transmission have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterised by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far occurs only with MERS among human coronavirus diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded, with a high fatality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known.
From mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and further designated the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude mortality of 3,4%.
Notably, the fatality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which presents as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high 82 percent nucleotide sequence homology, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between that of SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most often seen in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the presentation of nonspecific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is somewhat smaller.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing between humans, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, remains to be elucidated in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after passing between humans, will have an influence on the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community-acquired human coronaviruses that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of past human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious illness in humans and humans who developed serious illness from human coronaviruses have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired coronaviruses have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.
It's highly transmissible like community-acquired human coronaviruses, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus continuously and long-term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and serve as an amplifier host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission to the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data showed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with game.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all civets in the markets.
However, civets from wild masked palm trees or from farms without exposure to live animal markets were reported to be mostly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets would only act as an amplifying intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also act as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of them appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a bat fecal sample was shown to use ACE2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Amazingly, the serums of recovering SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Based on phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closest to their bat betacoronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies specifically, as have camels originating from the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, further supporting that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for MERS-CoV research.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral tract, which is also the main route of spread of bats viruses.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of camel contact before the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from bats Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of practically identical bats.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species being sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial COVID-19 cases were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals in danger, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may also harbor ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangolin coronavirus share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sublineages in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a greater degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs in lung samples, which turn out to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different methods of assembly and manual curing to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronavirus.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 related betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest full genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal advocates a recombination between SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronavirus and RaTG13 in the third wildlife species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronavirus.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Apalachee Mountain Coronavirus) detected in a North American tricolor bat was reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human-to-human coronavirus transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of species-to-species transmission of HCoV-229E is not as accurately known.
Bat alphacoronavirus closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them is an alpaca alpha coronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no alpaca alpha coronavirus has been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire the HCoV-229E-related alpha-coronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising if bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronavirus acts as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, specifically in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of species-to-species transmission, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is clear that bats contribute, with a rich collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and great flight capability are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus spreader".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It's well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host to being a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin betacoronavirus are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronavirus, as civets are in the case of SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities of species-to-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through killing or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts into which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans get the virus through killing and eating game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study in domestic and wild animals is required.
Third, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses could be considered moderate to high, with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a reading-checking exorribonuclease, the removal of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even nonviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to suppress the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that has been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Hopefully, it's already adapted to another human-like host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Second, the long RNA genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the likelihood of coevolution between species, which favors the emergence of new coronaviruses when the right conditions are given.
This is supported by the copious single open reading frames and functions of proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change templates randomly and frequently during RNA replication using a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing vehicle, chain change frequently occurs during RNA transcription of the coronavirus.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing species-to-species transmission.
At present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in species-to-species transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of a coronavirus S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found on amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from several animals, including the bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing for species-to-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from the isolated human and civet virus strains in the RBD and 4 of these are in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The civet SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be crucial for the virus' adaptation to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study points to 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this linkage compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correceptor might be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to humans, following species-to-species transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of human coronavirus species-to-species transmission is also determined by other host-dependence and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could be an obstacle to species-to-species transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host dependence factors and subvert host restriction factors for species-to-species transmission to be successful.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction have yet to be identified and characterized.
Objective full genome investigation of host-dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could prove useful.
New human coronavirus: starting from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination, also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but were found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A deletion of 29 nucleotides characteristic of SARS-CoVs was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the epidemic in humans.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to have recombinant events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses recombine with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which are more likely to result in the release of viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 was observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a change in the frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It seems bats are well adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to positive regulation of the NKG2/ CD94 natural killer cell inhibitory receptor and low expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the elevated metabolic activity of bats could suppress coronavirus replication and affect the exoribonuclease reading check, which provides selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of coronaviruses could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for adaptation to the host.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is the secret to why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of unlinking the immune response could have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat betacoronavirus has been found that shares a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin betacoronavirus have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin betacoronavirus could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or accidentally.
Coronavirus have regained prominence due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from human-civet contact in markets, closing wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several pangolin betacoronavirus lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to slaughter all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, they're circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have been around on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity presents itself to propagate.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, the opportunities for humans to come into contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if the population is educated to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, how humans come into contact with bats needs to be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins, must be elucidated.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide included our experience and is a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guideline and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria for suspected case and confirmed case according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., who put forward a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, it is necessary to combine any point of the epidemiological background characteristics with two points of the clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three points of the clinical manifestations must be met if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) travel history or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) contact history with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) contact history with groups of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, school office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any pathogenic or serological test characteristics as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome showing high homogeneity to the recognized novel coronaviruses; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase in the title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for detecting nucleic acid in blood or respiratory samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then, serological testing was added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to be cautious with asymptomatic and atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system should also be verified in other studies and clinical practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to send us their comments.
For diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend that you seek and follow the latest guidelines in your country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest number in a single day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day yesterday.
That's the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, head of Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until this coming Saturday.
This suspension of public transportation had initially started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, involving two men who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three had recovered.
More than one million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfews were only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its stay-at-home order through May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lowered the limits on toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase limits for toilet paper to two and one pack per transaction in all supermarkets across the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also enforced a package limit.
These limitations were posted as messages on the boxes and on the chains' Facebook pages.
According to reports, consumers were stocking up for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited home delivery toilet paper purchases to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous four-pack per transaction restriction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, "many supermarkets still run out of product within an hour of delivery", and said the demand "was unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales rose with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a planned Wednesday special bid.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times are making it difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the anticipated release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that supermarkets stock up every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low stockpile in numbers, and when it runs out, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, intensifying the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there was an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [be bought] and there were large quantities, the panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to keep supplies running, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page leaflet designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on shopping.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packets of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general.
We are very concerned, both about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and about the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its onset to continuous global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time", he added.
The new pandemic condition emerges following the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "in conclusion, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97 000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case-by-case mortality rate was estimated to be 4 % in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04 % in Algeria to 0.08 % in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation of people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused a severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus was spread on the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and in early January 2020 an investigation was launched.
The cases were mostly related to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, so the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person known to have manifested symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last wet market group.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were identified as having a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province, may have been the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly declined in China but increased suddenly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded, for the first time, the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60 per cent of the UK population would need to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have undergone COVID-19 testing, and who have a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test people who only had mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the numbers of infections in Italy were considerably higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, most often 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60, and 75% had pre-existing illnesses, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refer to deceased people who tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died without being tested, for example, in their homes, nursing homes, etc., may not be included.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is an underestimate", a claim corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the United States.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0 % (97 039/1 617 204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths to cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with onset of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other indicators include case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from a disease, and infection fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics have no time frame and consider a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall pandemic infection fatality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on case-by-case mortality rate estimates.
The WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University stated, "Infectious outbreaks, if left unchecked, usually stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen".
The Chinese government's top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could be over by June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, expressed that SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University expressed, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it is so easily transmitted, will disappear completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the re-emergence would depend on herd immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively nonspecific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the airways (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pressure or pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluish color on the face or lips; upon manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not showing clinical symptoms, although test results confirm infection, therefore, researchers advised to monitor and screen those who have close contact with confirmed infected people carefully to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30%, and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly during close contact and through the small droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies show that when you cough uncovered, the droplets can travel from 15 feet (4.5 m) to 27 feet (8.2 m).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking.
The droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore airborne spread.
It can also be spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, it usually infects two or three people.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature.Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the acute respiratory illness case group in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies upon contact with soap, which dissolves its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed to be zoonotic in origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the full genome level, it is 96 percent identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only a difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, comparison of the complete genome has indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92 percent of the genetic material, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, although ultimately confirmed through polymerase-reverse transcriptase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography imaging.
According to a study in Wuhan that compared the polymerase chain reaction with CT scans, CT scans are much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a throat swab can also be used.Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been shown to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the USA, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-ray and CT images of symptomatic individuals include asymmetrical peripheral opacity of glazed glass and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of results obtained in images of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, diagnosis by unconfirmed imaging by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT chest scans with polymerase chain reaction scans and showed that although imaging is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it could be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convoluted neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the community-wide spread stage in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they became infected.It is recommended that healthcare providers who treat someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions, and wear eye protection.Tracing contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, nasal washing and mouthwash gargling are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with various solutions (within one minute after exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0,1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0,5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0,27,5% povidone iodide.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a facility, such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a disposable cough or sneeze cloth, and that they immediately discard the cloth.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by respiratory droplets that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene".
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends using non-medical masks made of cloth.China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or being in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend that people make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask when in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government has required the wearing of masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel has requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, on April 1 required passengers to wear masks on long-distance trains and buses.
Panama imposed mandatory wearing of masks to go outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks to those who cannot afford them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greetings that do not include contact and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments now require or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of severe illness and complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay at home as much as possible in areas of the community affected by the outbreak. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had repercussions on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
They include recommendations to have sex only with a person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation.Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine of entire populations in affected areas.
Stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are recommended to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease can no longer be controlled, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive number to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, mask use, and self-quarantine; community-based measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community commitment to foster acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental and surface cleaning measures.
Other countries also took a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass screening assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies.Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which slows the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the peak demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but must be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first), otherwise transmission is quickly reactivated when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response measure to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and primary care services for resource redistribution at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling optional procedures where possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first case (called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin.On 26 December, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were observed by Dr. Zhang Jixian in charge of the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police reprimanded eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO.
In early January, enough cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributed by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and an important railway junction.
On 20 January, China reported around 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms.As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, in-place shelter orders or confinement) and curfews.As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are in some form of confinement in the United States, over 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates the first case occurred on 17 November.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital reported to the Jianghan CDC from Wuhan on December 27.
The first genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a health cordon was announced on 23 January banning travel in and out of Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.

For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city.As of March 23, mainland China had only transmitted one case nationwide in the previous five days, this time through a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, as well as Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.On 26 March 2020, China's Foreign Ministry announced that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses.The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online to comply with physical distancing in order to prevent a re-emergence of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms.On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, over 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected, and thus modified.South Korea introduced what was considered the world's largest and best-organized program to test for the virus in the population and isolate infected people, as well as identify and quarantine those who had been in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by people newly arrived from other countries through a mobile app, drive-thru centers to conduct virus testing with results available the next day, and increasing diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20 000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon's removal from office for what they saw as the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or to praise his response.

Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
The Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by February 28, indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported that they had tested positive for the virus.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He said there is a greater risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 former or incumbent Iranian politicians had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran was experiencing 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, Iran may have five times as many cases as are reported.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief of economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases were detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining over 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "No one will be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
Work activities and sporting events have already been ordered to be suspended in those areas". On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities across the country as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but, on 9 March, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies.

A CNN report indicated that Italy's combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK Government did not impose any kind of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government has come under criticism for its apparent lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public.[citation needed] On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement advising against social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from home when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments such as bars and gyms, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which banned gatherings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those deemed strictly necessary.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in conducting testing, which obscured the true magnitude of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the federal government's lack of approval of non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until early March (after which a medical order was required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
As of 13 March, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14 000 tests had been carried out.

The WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and containing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic over the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision by central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while "it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and said it was "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (ESPII), the sixth ESPII since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that the reason for the spread of IBS was "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the world community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "which do not have systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, if any".
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future".On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros claimed that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to bring the "power of the entire UN system into the response".
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the entire UN response, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development consequences of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with leading institutions at the national level and to conduct site visits to assess the "impact of provincial and county level response activities, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world needs to do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", noting that although it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should nonetheless be "in a preparedness phase".
In response to an ongoing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency programme, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared", insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, noting that such a declaration would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction". WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed that the rights of all people should be respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all people have a right to health, including people with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older people, internally displaced persons, homeless people, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, in addition to views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of lockdown and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, the UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were fired due to their handling of quarantine-related efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe this measure was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, dismissed a previous acknowledgement of the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and claimed that "China's censorship overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction[ing] from his administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a US Government cable describing a communications ploy apparently originating at the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "All About China".
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and TV appearances. "Media outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The EU's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it reportedly sent aid to these last two countries.
On April 3, US sanctions blocked Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries into their own country.
And there have been reports of mask-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity".
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they too will be able to respond if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a reduced scale.
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary-General Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries involved, but also those of the people of the countries in which they operate".
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, saying his country is having difficulty combating the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran.The outbreak prompted demands for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts have predicted that it may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts", after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized regarding Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon's removal from office for what they saw as the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or to praise his response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections and sanction those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for several cases of shortages of supplies, as a result of increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions in logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven shopping that left shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, leading to shortages of supplies.
The tech sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic product shipments.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to 20 times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical articles.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
Measures by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages that were anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant reduction, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: According to a press report on March 16, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak has been considered a threat of considerable destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of the potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly "turned on its head" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On 24 February, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their steepest falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 200708.
All three indices ended the week down more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed the sovereign credit rating of China but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again on the basis of fears over the coronavirus, the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many people think that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel bans, closure of public places including travel attractions and recommendations from governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have canceled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry reached an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season related to Chinese New Year holidays.
Several large-scale events were canceled by national and regional governments, including New Year's Eve festivals, while private companies also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised its response level to the infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60% drop.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to monitor the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment. About 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the lockdown began in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German short-term workers' compensation scheme has been adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting on the operations of organisations and on people, both employed and self-employed, worldwide.
Organisations in the culture and arts sector tried to fulfil their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, around the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasingly rapidly increasing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Easter celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services via radio, live Internet broadcast or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also canceled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the outbreak-affected areas and then closed shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020 but not later than summer 2021".[31] Casinos and other gambling venues around the world were closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.[32]
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of Internet "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous internet memes about the coronavirus have spread, as many resort to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world who expressed that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered a fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the virus-affected areas have received support, both online and offline.
Following the spread of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to get Chinese banned from entering their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the UK and the US, have reported higher levels of racist slurs, in addition to assaults.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta later condemned the comments, saying they were "erroneous".[33] In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign trash" and destined for "throwaway".
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for parts or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers published scientific papers related to the outbreak available in open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the polymerase-reverse transcriptase chain reaction test, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are wide variations in the number of tests carried out across countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The polymerase-reverse transcriptase chain reaction test with pharyngeal swabs is only reliable in the first week of disease.
Afterwards, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals who are tested in the second week, the sample material can alternatively be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled when coughing (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed at Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade polymerase chain reaction-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time reverse transcriptase-containing polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel for the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and a test-run deadlock at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were satisfactorily processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only then were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 tests based on polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, as of March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 tests available nationally.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Care Supervision Service. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in high volume, allowing one machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received emergency use authorisation from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day.In Taiwan, a test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed, with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as a rapid test for influenza.
As of March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results can be obtained even before symptoms appear".
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobaric opacities in glazed glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance develops, patterns in stone and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, the origin point of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
Part of the immune system's response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people from approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in population surveillance.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For tests in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial specimens may be used to track the immune response.
For point-of-care testing, a single blood sample is usually taken by a skin puncture.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is needed before analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody testing kits it had purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department gives the patient a sample tube", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result in a short time.The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to test suspected cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used.In tests at drive-through centers for COVID-19 of suspected cases, a healthcare professional takes samples taking proper precautions.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
The health insurance covers the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests a week.
As of March 19, tests were being offered through the drive-through system in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, by the 12/2020 regular week, a total of at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including the 12/2020 week, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples from 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping samples and only doing further analysis if the combined sample results positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI inaugurated a 2000 square meter improvised emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10 000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and took 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to face the quarantine would have doubled without this testing capacity.
After the Wuhan lab, Huo-Yan labs were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open-source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow up to 1122 patient samples to be evaluated for COVID19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection tests per person in its population than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capacity and purchasing a mass production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on their 'Huo-Yan' emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to operate outside China.
Different test formulas addressing different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to make kits that it sent to low-income countries that didn't have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the tests available in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on testing.
On the contrary, experts say that South Korea's high availability of tests helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean Government has achieved its testing capability, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the US, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents ran out.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the testing kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government later removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would recall the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China which turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use".The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not working.
Testing, supplemented by quarantine of those who obtained positive results and identification of people who had been in contact with those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing across the entire population of around 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With travel restrictions in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive contact tracing, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much more slowly than in other developed countries, but which did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents to stay home, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracing, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less strict confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have done more testing, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries have a better ability to detect people who have only mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the table below, the column Positive as % of tests is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who are admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive number as a percentage of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other things are the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap regularly at certain "critical times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are spread by fecal-oral route.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecating, after wiping a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ash.
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in growth stature in children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50 percent.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing safe drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be attributed to handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections, as an automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under five, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths a year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a routine can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cutting diarrhea deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the toilet (urinating, defecating), after cleaning a child's tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when proper handwashing techniques should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States was about half that at 77%, and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviors, to increase the adoption of the habit of handwashing with soap at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of tailored action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective at cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable water flow makes cleaning easier.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired from previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Still, the CDC states that "liquid soap with hand-free dispensing controls is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted intensively to a health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that using the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves naturally antibiotic resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
Warm, pleasant water for hand washing is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rub, antiseptic hand rub or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the dryness effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol effectively kill germs.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants kill bacteria, bacteria resistant to various drugs (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Rubbing alcohol-based disinfectants containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before using hand sanitizer to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry out the skin, unless emollients or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The dryness effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol based hand rubs are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause contact irritant dermatitis was attractive compared with hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and formula, and historically has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based rubbing solutions.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The proper handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with standing water may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make any difference.
Rub your hands to foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods of time eliminates more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Washing your hands in a container can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or air dry.
Wet and wet hands are more likely to get re-contaminated, and the parts that are most often overlooked are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economical options can be used to facilitate handwashing when running water or soap is not available, for example, pouring water from a hanging bin or a pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home taps" and other economical options.
A homemade tap is a simple technology that involves using a jar suspended from a rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public restrooms.
Research has increasingly shown that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by the most modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, the total amount of bacteria was found to increase, on average, by 194 percent on the fingertips and 254 percent on the palms.
Air-jet drying resulted in an average increase in total bacteria by 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased on average by 76% on the fingertips and 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The airjet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds reportedly of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 metres away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer is an alternative during travel, when there is no water or soap.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing for doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for preventing disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Doctors wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to foam and scrub all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by interlacing fingers.
If there are any debris under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, use the paper towel to close the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent transmission.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, hand washing is still unacceptable in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in healthcare settings.
The preliminary version of the organisation's hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
After treating patients, adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicinal or antibacterial soaps) gives the hand washing agent the ability to be disposed of.
This may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are common. To wash your hands before surgery, you need a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to scrub and another sterilized instrument to clean under your nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, prevent water from the forearms from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after treating sick people.
To control staph infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand hygiene has been found to be in the first 20% of washing and very little additional benefit when hand hygiene frequency is increased by more than 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. When comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26 percent more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands than alcohol-based hand sanitizers.[citation needed] Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include training staff on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an economical and fundamental tool for good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes universal handwashing behaviours a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few handwashing faucets near public or private toilets, although there are economical options to build handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can also be the result of ingrained habits and not a lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, community approaches were found to be effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.[citation needed] An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to, eventually, three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the handwashing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to raise awareness to change behaviour.As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF pushed for the creation of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to avoided DHA.
However, one analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as new mothers or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the Englishwoman who "founded modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illness and health care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic made many countries more aware of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany signs with "correct hand-washing techniques" were hung near the sinks of public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "wash your hands" is a statement of not wanting to take charge of something or share in the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her guilt over the crimes she had committed and which she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after recalling or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value items for hand washing more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, with water but without soap, is part of ritual hand washing in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washroom in Christianity and wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend hygienic hand washing, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require that people wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing of the hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls in the workplace in the face of COVID-19
COVID-19 workplace risk control refers to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and work task and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for workers who may be at risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal workplace contact with the public and coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, recommending workers to stay home if sick, respiratory hygiene standards, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Medium-risk exposures include those where frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, crowded work environments and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in the event of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral service workers, exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols on people known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or handle samples from these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have various consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are sick, because they have to care for others, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded and in terms of the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying during off-peak hours, through door-to-door delivery services or through the car window).
Finally, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be disrupted.An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of an outbreak response include reducing transmission between staff members, protecting those at highest risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework in occupational health and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected for the hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used properly and systematically, checked frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal workplace contact with the public and coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, recommending workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards including covering when coughing and sneezing, providing paper towels and containers for waste, preparing for teleworking or shift work if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a key measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until they have no fever, fever signs, or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medications to relieve symptoms or decrease fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have contracted SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission around the company location, or because the person recently traveled internationally to a place with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a high concentration of people, and some large retail retail retail environments.Engineering controls for this group and higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective covers, and placing a window for the service of care so that the customer can order from the car.Administrative controls for this group and higher risk groups include requiring sick workers to stay at home, replacing workplace meetings with virtual communications, recommending limited staircase visits, suspending travel that is not essential to COVID-19 risk behaviour.According to COVID-19, customers must frequently wear masks and develop plans on how to use a workplace, use personal protective equipment, use a carpet wash, and use a combination of tools and tools that are in place to prevent and prevent exposure to COVID-19, and develop a comprehensive training and training on how to protect workers from the risk of exposure to the workplace, including the use of personal protective equipment, and other measures that are in place to prevent and prevent exposure to COVID-19, and how to use personal protective equipment, including a carpet washer, personal protective equipment and a combination of tools and equipment.
Workers in this risk group should rarely wear respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the sick person separated from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves when attending to a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and perhaps personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
In the case of commercial shipping, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing travel for sickness, self-isolation, and immediately reporting to the onboard medical center if anyone develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical education or choir classes or dining room meals, increasing space between desks, staggering entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate health room for children with flu symptoms.
For law enforcement personnel who perform routine daily activities, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
Police officers who must come into contact with people who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during a stop, workers shall clean and disinfect their work belts and equipment with a household cleaning spray or wipes before re-use and follow the standard operating procedure for containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and morgue workers to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposures include delivery, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses.
These become very high-risk exposures if workers perform aerosol generation procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures are intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue jobs include those in which workers are involved in preparing the corpses of people who had COVID-19 or were suspected to have it at the time of death; these come at a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies.Additional engineering controls for those at-risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19, even when performing aerosol-generation procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter should be isolated in different waiting rooms depending on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working up to 6 feet away from patients who have or are suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol-generation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or higher N95 respirators with filter mask should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend the use of protective masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, provide care or transport them without performing aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, goggles or face shield, coat and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use it, replacing it with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting permission to enter a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, wearing the same mask without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

This month, we find ourselves in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have to one another.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we've seen among all our colleagues in the emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we're lucky enough to work with are.
I could not feel more grateful and proud that you are all my partners.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to come to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether it's keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues get paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, starting this next week, we're going to make some major adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to Our Work and Schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and our schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we're facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, go shopping, or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, you don't work.
Although I shouldn't have to say it, we do.
You don't need to take sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure key work areas are covered.
(If you receive a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, please notify Bryan, T&C Operations, so T&C can help with support and ensure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work by the hour will get paid in full.
As we said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and our hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress into the world around us.
Whatever we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we're asking is that you contact your manager so we know what to expect and we can adjust properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and modify our approach to support whatever is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all concentrate on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new targets and timelines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and caring for loved ones while we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces the current planning burdens and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will inform the delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and cleanliness of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, plus the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located on a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
As of last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with shared guidelines with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City may already know, we've also been talking about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely before know that this mode requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the length of meetings to one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are required, consider breaking them up over several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Take video as your default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make collaboration and live connectivity easier.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person to control chat questions and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need a handy headset.
Use the welfare reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The HR RR Operations team is analysing ergonomics guidelines based on webinars to support increased work spread across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editatons, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We inform you that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for you to fulfil your part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
We'll follow up with additional guidelines at Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences next week.
The overall sentiment of the global community seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief over the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 issues
We'll be sending you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We'll take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're available to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently being heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage issues or anything else you may need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and liaison when needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global International Operations at HRR.
None of these changes should be considered a waiver of our work and our obligations.
Instead, it's a recognition that, right now, our work and our obligations probably need to be adapted in a way that hasn't happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it needs.
Our planned work will still be there for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and make room for the important work that's coming in the coming weeks and possibly the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to look after yourselves and look after your families so that you can be in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The team is composed of the following individuals: Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ECA2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other types of cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a renal colectrin amino acid transporter C-terminal domain.
ECA2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, to small intestinal enterocytes, to venous arterial and endothelial cells and to smooth muscle arterial cells in most organs.
mRNA expression of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to counter the ECA.
The RCT cleaves the hormone from angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 cleaved the terminal carboxyl amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzed it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also clease several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the S1 spindle protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy.
However, several professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuation of standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy.
A review with systematic meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that 'the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases'.
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who were at increased risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as robust for the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus the duration of effect of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicinal product for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAIS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 apps are software applications for mobile devices designed to help with contact tracing in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government backing in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular in relation to systems that rely on the tracking of the geographical location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It's already in use in over 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, they're using an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source app and will be leased to the government.In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the contact tracing app was at an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks.A similar app is planned to be used in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether app and Singapore's BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry app for patients living in Moscow who have received a COVID-19 diagnosis, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible ineffectiveness if the adoption of the app is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus apps and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations set eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance would have to be 'lawful, necessary and proportionate';
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related purposes;
security and anonymity should be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined in law;
protections against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights to respond to such abuse should be established;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used, instead of apps, which eliminated both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy concerns.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing.
Instead of using a specific app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and credit card transactions, and combined them to generate text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert about potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites.Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized systems and privacy protection.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been released.
Privacy-protected contact tracing is a well-established concept, with a large body of published research going back at least to 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort containing both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol.Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, the personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all the matching happens on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical report "Apps Out of Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly matching protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key aspect to achieving broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative that they claimed would protect privacy, which is based on a combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy-protecting encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementing tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Re-spin (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest which they then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study and recommend it for clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an urgent use authorization (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are under way.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventative use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug.
It may not be safe for women who are pregnant or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ' no benefit was observed'.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses, and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two led by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate disease and another for those with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19 are ongoing; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial of Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is underway and will enroll 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in decreasing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults 40 and older with a COVID-19 diagnosis and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who do not have an effective contraceptive are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study involving 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
{NS}
b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, five potential vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale-up implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The targets of the main platforms that underwent Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (developer of phase I and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, vector of adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be planned or being developed).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary tests of safety and immunogenicity, is usually randomized, is placebo-controlled and is performed at multiple sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease, while controlling for adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular binding that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human trials to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotech partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment of neoantigene vaccines against cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that tests were beginning.
On 27 February 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was beginning a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested on humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although it is progressing rapidly, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human trials are expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large sums of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine", to which the German Government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The possible vaccine based on mRNA BNT162 is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that human trials of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to USD 29 million.
CEPI's other partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The potential vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a host of potential vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Around the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced tests of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent antigen-specific antibody responses (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probable nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate within the human bacterium and produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three universities in the US pooled resources to access IBM's supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressing ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for handling live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against GASR and MMR have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against GERD that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat GERD was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, a SROM (DNA-based) vaccine completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and a vaccine already existed.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorgan failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is mainly spread between people through close contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
While these droplets are produced by exhalation, they usually fall to the floor or to surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease.The standard method for diagnosis is polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
We recommend that people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers wear masks.
Recommendations for the use of masks for the general public vary, with some authorities recommending that they not be used, others recommending that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and bluish-black face or lips.
It is less common to see symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, runny nose and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented with chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorgan failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that about 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking out loud releases more droplets than speaking at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause the droplets to travel 15 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's bedrooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosoling of respiratory secretions and, consequently, airborne transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through feces, the risk is thought to be low.The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread is possible before symptoms begin, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person usually infects two or three more.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on products containing 99 percent copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly, as soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus by bursting its protective bubble.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of the infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to the ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors have high expression in the heart and are involved in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to poor prognosis.In autopsies of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by the epithelial cells that express ECA2 from the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretory T cells were observed to correlate with recruitment of IL-6 secretory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in autopsies.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on samples of the airway obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, samples of nasal swabs or sputum may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples must be taken two weeks apart and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain of coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
The experience in China with testing has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disordered stone pattern (lobulilar septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, abnormally large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
ADD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in healing: organization of exudate in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without first washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and, if you don't have a tissue, using the inside of your elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, one reason being to limit transmission by asymptomatic people.Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also state that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021, at the earliest, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol, but only when water and soap are not available in a timely manner.For areas where hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is due to ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antiseptic".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are provided with supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that anyone suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMOC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments can be helpful for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonologists in the U.S. compiled recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an airborne infection isolation area (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to prevent airborne transmission.The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is an EPP coat, mask, goggles and medical gloves.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but are not guaranteed to be effective against a specific biological agent that is not stated in the product information.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support for hospitalized people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway bipressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the health system's ability to handle the sudden increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different modes of pressure control and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested on people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for any disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine but also alerts local health officials.Analysis of cellphone information macro data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to reinforce quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summarized location data of the phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators had informed him that "in any case, 40 per cent of people are still moving".
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42 000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about quarantine, travel restrictions and treatment side effects or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be mild with few or no symptoms, and will resemble other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but data for COVID-19 are insufficient.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to water respiratory distress syndrome (WRSD) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorgan failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired blood clotting, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Altered clotting, specifically increased protombin time, has been reported in 6 % of hospitalized patients with COVID-19; while altered kidney function is observed in 4 % of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average time of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among males was 2.8% and among females was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with exudate fibromycoid cells in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people hospitalized had a pre-existing condition.The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The undercount of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and imaging of the lungs suggests organ damage.
This can also cause post-recovery intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It appears that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases recovered from COVID-19 that later tested positive for coronavirus have been reported.
These cases are thought to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through interspecific infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but, by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, pointed to the first date of onset of symptoms as December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, various measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are affected by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global fatality rate is 6.9 % (153 822/2 240 191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the diagnosed patient fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infected person fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics are time independent and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of cases.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people were infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected younger people, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all COVID-19 deaths have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined from blood donors.
69 (0.004%) of the population have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women only narrows at 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this sex difference are not known, but it may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Sex-based immunological differences, fewer women who smoke, and the fact that males have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age may have contributed to the higher male mortality rate.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track sex information in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and GERD, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations on naming to prevent stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV water respiratory disease as temporary names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidance not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material, such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve and the supplier could not deliver it on time, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the 100 necessary valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers are conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organisation launched the 'SOlidarity trial' to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing potential vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are looking to develop a full-blown virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, either inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 virus infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease.It has been suggested that antibody-based enhancement is a potential challenge for developing vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries, which are due to report by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and potential drugs against COVID-19 was underway. Several antiviral medications for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020.The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for research.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after it was determined that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial target of the S protein by transmembrane serine-protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Release of cytokines may be a complication of the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.
It is in a national non-randomised phase II trial in Italy after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is hoped that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, these effects, which are thought to be the cause of death in some infected people, will be counteracted.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, T-CAR T lymphocyte treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
