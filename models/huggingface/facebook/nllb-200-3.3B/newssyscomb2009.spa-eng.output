Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a considerable weakening of both parties in the current grand coalition and a marked strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP) has suffered heavy losses, with the position of its current chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, seriously faltering.
On the other hand, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the Carinthian state government, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, thus losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has ended the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
It is the worst, literally catastrophic, result in the post-war history of these two great Austrian parties and especially for the popular parties who called these early elections.
As early as July, when the OVP left the coalition, the Popular Party had a considerable advantage over the SPO in terms of preference.
It's clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government go down.
Already in the first reactions to the results speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved as early as Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party's leadership.
Such a development would obviously facilitate the way to the constant and more approximate starting point of the election results, i.e. the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have gained about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen again in 1999 when the Popular negotiated with the Populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it broke off from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction from the European Union.
This is clearly the case for Haider, who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and is already returning to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party also made it to parliament, although it lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four per cent threshold and is therefore not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegally collecting beetles in India is not resolved, it could lead to a chill in Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was stated by the Minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
The Commission is also proposing that the EU should be given the opportunity to make a contribution to the development of the EU's energy sector.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempted from charges and fined, the government can negotiate with the local government in Darjiling whose jurisdiction the matter falls under.
"Your problem could be solved", said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, the best thing would be, according to Mukherjee, who appeals to the highest instances.
He then asked for the case to be dismissed and he could wait in prison for the verdict.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague spoke in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises appealing to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible", said the Czech foreign minister.
The only way the Czech side can get involved in the matter is by getting the convict a "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that the Indian side was already getting this kind of support.
'We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize it too", commented Schwarzenberg.
Moreover, as the ČTK said, it insisted to its colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists to be of great importance.
"We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists", he announced.
The Minister evaded the question whether he had received a promise from the Indian side that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received a lot of promises", he said.
A Czech referee a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, which shows Australia surrounded by sea.
It is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small dot lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the sea bed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Matters.
Their chief, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exposition and sometimes the entire exposition.
This talent and enthusiasm of work governs.
The seabed still hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms to this day that themselves hold the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The deep is greater than the dry land
The countries with coastlines have now begun to argue fiercely over the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty they take advantage of the rights they agreed upon in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is essentially the so-called Continental Shelf, which sometimes extends for a few hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
The latter has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights to all resources on the Continental Shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the sea floor and its surface that is a natural continuation of the underwater continent.
It extends to the edge of the sea coast, and often to the 200 nautical mile border, which is a pure economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf must be accompanied by scientific and technical documentation based on research and measurements.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation work.
"One of our tasks is to organize a commission of technical and legal expert help.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those from the last three countries have come forward", adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as the first to essentially expand its maritime domain.
But so did New Zealand - the seabed area the commission awarded last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in its study.
The profits from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so for up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the Continental Shelf ends, begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty to be the "common heritage of mankind".
Here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right to exploit in these areas is administered by treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine", says Director Mikulka emphatically adding "that its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract".
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has a warrant to explode in the Clarion-Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rough, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
"A total of 75,000 square miles can be mined.
The area is rich in deposits of polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, who according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages the German special forces command was at the scene of action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked Germany for help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
So the liberation site was staffed by specialists from the German army, as well as officials from the GSG 9, the Federal Police's air squadron, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office and the technical charity's logistics experts.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as a support on the ground.
"Fortunately, that time did not come", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants kidnapped a group of travellers, including five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian travellers.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported back and forth across the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the people who were saved, safe and sound, arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, 5 tourists and the special forces have to return in Airbus of the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The US House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package
The first chamber of the United States Congress has narrowly failed to deliver a huge $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected by a vote of 227 to 206 the government's financial market rescue package.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, it failed to get a majority for the program that should limit disorder in financial markets.
In dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince the critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the Democratic negotiator had asked the deputies to take a vote even though the plan is not as popular.
"It's hard to get political approval to prevent something that has absolutely not happened yet", he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to over 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for that was investors' concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts expect other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To put the program into effect, it needs to be approved by both the House and the Senate.
The organizers register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened economic climate, the desire to travel among Germans remains the same as before.
As reported on Monday by the German travel association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, the reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The results are based on GfK figures which are the information analysed on bookings in 1200 travel agencies and computed for approximately the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened dollar, travel to the United States is in high demand, DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased by almost a third.
The preferred destinations of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
In particular, organised trips are much preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices rise, in this case travel costs are 'better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip'.
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance reservation discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
In the summer months too, trips were well booked, so that sales volumes increased again compared to last year - although according to another study the number of Germans taking a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the open-air parties at the Endless Spa, the beer in one-litre jugs and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A tented debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, the hostess on TV and wears a custom Bavarian traditional costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are just in the tent, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos - it is very flattering especially because this is my first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Bavarian traditional costume seems to do its job.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from the north of Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after we got to the Prairie of Teresa, it's not all that great.
Almost everyone is wearing traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; no one seems to mind or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets the weirdest looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A woman from Munich calls my attention to my apron, which was dressed in the wrong way: "the left part is the maiden, the middle is the virgin, the right part is the betrothed, the back is the widow".
Oh, God, now I'm gonna turn left from behind.
"It's okay", he says laughing.
The others don't care much for the subtle methods of flirting and wear hats that say "To drink to get dressed!" and show their naked buttocks without being asked.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is named Bob, he is from England and he is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
I'm telling you after I put aside his glass of a litre of beer he just drank.
You put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not so lucky and can't consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, groups of sanitarians rush around the party venue and have to worry about poor drunks.
The sanitarians appear in groups - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered stretches from one tent to the other.
That's how it works with most visitors: they come in sober, they come out drunk.
You don't see who's suffering from the degrees of alcoholism and is in the running.
"They are the ones who 'can't take it anymore,'" a paramedic answered my question and disappeared in a fit of rage.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being struck by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the town of Brentwood, was implicated in the accident which occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was a member of the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate the interior of this country.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 paces inland into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, that's what the guides say.
The building is set to face the end of the platforms and carries in front two towers, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building at your complex is a little decadent.
But once the vaulted box office was over, there was no doubt whatever the greatness of the enterprise that this was the most western door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that cordoned off Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under the influence of the Soviet Union.
British rule and as the forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded, destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then, the station has been in decline and has been left out of history.
But today this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there's a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got on a gurney and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert on foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a rocking journey that produced the old world cadences in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
which has aroused some suspicion in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to discuss/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
'The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he says.
Turkey has been cut off in its relations with the interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It's not a case if it's not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point", I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey", he replies, "does not want to face that choice".
The European Union must not be allowed to continue to be a party to the international community, and the European Union must not be allowed to continue to be a party to the international community.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe as a whole can metaphorically set up those rail lines that open up the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after a second night of sleeplessness, my thoughts turn to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had assisted in the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would now largely be in the hands of Turkey.
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe".
So, there's not much doubt as to which continent this fascinating country should claim.
Lives to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (pictured, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its final song in 1979, a number of us were in our late 20s - we just refused to play up to the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) represented the choir's willingness and ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never imposing, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical spark, it always ended on a higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I've reviewed over 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I've never, by any, been disappointed  on the contrary, I've been inspired many times by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two war horses that were very well known throughout the world".
We'll miss him very much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) you state that "in 1946 he resumed the study of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 won a Houblon-Norman research fellowship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate".
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years 1950-51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career, remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his documentary-style black and white photographs are fantastic.
I was struck by their simplicity and by the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
A display that shows a lot of feeling.
Resin knows how to capture magic moments".
Second round for the Honda supersell
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
Added to this are refined mechanics that increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution against the revolution.
So is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that succeeds, the changes introduced in this monovolumen are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model it should be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation to the market.
So, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz is less well known in Europe, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan alone, the Jazz has sold close to a million units since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which represents 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those in charge of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand's managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda is relying on the arrival of another new model.
The Insight is a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - that the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By market and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, after its presentation in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its parts.
Its length is increased to 3.90 meters (five centimeters), its width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters), and the wheelbase to 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, does not change and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
The luggage compartment, which has a double bottom system, has a capacity of 399 litres, 19 litres more than the first-generation luggage compartment.
It should be noted that these measurements are from the version with the 1.4 engine, since the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that lead to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of the Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will have two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines incorporate i-VTEC technology which achieves lower fuel consumption, less carbon dioxide emissions, excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time high torque throughout the engine.
The first 1.2 litre engine delivers 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it goes to have 100.
This 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has this time been inspired by nature, specifically by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this little robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general director of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to reinforce the collision-prevention capability of the brand's vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that looks a lot like the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most importantly, the bee's compound eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allow it to fly uninterruptedly within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within a radius of 180 degrees ahead of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor which immediately results in the collision avoidance.
"Once it detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right or a left angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasive maneuver is entirely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project's lead engineer.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot swerve up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to avoid collisions with the small robot.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It requires no storing of information or intuitive logic for previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even mega-gigs".
This is the first step in developing new technologies for instant collision avoidance, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in mass production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination by avoiding obstacles in the way.
Tremble before you mortgage
The US Treasury, it must be admitted, besides having plenty of liquid to inject, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'bad credit hotel'... or the mess.
The dreadful aspect of this lodging and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably their goal.
It does have useful information, but it is not detailed.
It's more a teenage site than a general audience site.
What if the game is complete?
So, a dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we never talked about buying a better house...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, will be buying a 21% stake in the company for $9 billion. The news has been met with a sharp drop in its stock price.
A week after discovering an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at $25.25 per share, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible bonds, which will guarantee a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be carried out at a unit price of US$ 29, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley shares were still down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status", explained Juan Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new charter last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but it does put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Their alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to behave much more cautiously than before.
The terms of the deal presented on Monday also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought the stake would have been made up of ordinary shares only.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimise risks and hedge ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the deal will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at around USD 47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley claims that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group refused to give details of the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should have a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan must have eased his balance sheet a lot since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which has seen its stock market share fall by half as the cost of a default risk on its debt skyrocketed.
This cost was falling last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other sole survivor of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised 15 billion dollars, partly for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, is the third day in which a draft for a new Constitution was put to the vote.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results which referred to 80% of the suffrages.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to receive half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a count by a non-governmental organisation had announced a broad victory for the "yes", estimating between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution triumphed in a crushing way", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in complete calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies the increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving for it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the raid against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were kidnapped in the desert ten days ago arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good when they arrived at 15:30 on board a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since been moving from one hole to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the safari's organization.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of fire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled", said this official who requested anonymity.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces unit "Blitz" were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We have to admit that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the secret services, the special forces", he said, without going into detail.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The Sudanese army claimed on Tuesday that it intercepted a SUV carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six of them, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two others.
He also claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by the group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying the current election campaign.
It's better this way.
But one sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums that are given to the starving little museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historical sites?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government of its neglect of its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in your Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the American people and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 people, grouped in 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies, are concerned with researching history, preserving private archives and preserving archaeological sites.
It is these that are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and managers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The Dutch governments nationalise part of Fortis Bank.
The Dutch States - the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis which is in trouble due to the impact of the mortgage crisis on the North American market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution which also has business in Hungary with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner responsible for economic competition.
Fortis Bank was the first to suffer from the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves for more than a year, so the decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in a sense be considered as precedents.
According to the decision adopted in the early hours of Sunday, the three States will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell some of its business, including the mainly insurance business it bought last year from the Dutch bank ABN AMRO.
The shares of Fortis started a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to allow itself to fail.
The company's stock just on Friday fell 12 percent, the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the stock has dropped by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current share prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management blamed the sharp fall in Fortis' shares on the uncertainties of the North American market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but no firm offer has been made so far.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they had nothing to worry about, they would not lose their money.
There was no panic among the bank's customers so far, they did not raid the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, upon seeing the data on the purchase of medication, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy experts fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programmes for the protection of personal data, which in all cases link the use of prescription data to the approval of the person concerned.
It must be in independent hands, otherwise "we leave the henhouse to the fox" - the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation depend on the client's health condition and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They sent the client to a doctor's office and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily obtains from pharmacies the list of medicines bought in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and health status of the customer.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is practically incurably high, and you are immediately put in a higher risk category.
There are many versions of the scheme, some even setting a risk number, so the insurance company and the administration have little to do, although there are some minor difficulties in this respect.
Among the disadvantages of the programme are that some medicines are multi-purpose, for example certain substances are used both for headache and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies whereas the former is not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not received a fine for their negligence so far.
Some companies are also developing lab test results and linking them to drug consumption data to obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is becoming more and more difficult to control its use.
There is a specific law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and healthcare providers.
A bill is already before Congress that gives the authority the right to control companies specialized in the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard recognises that this is insufficient: he has therefore developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the individual for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, after all, are exposed to the fox's goodwill.
The French and French menu
EU to double trade with India
As the European Union and India are each other's trading partners, this issue along with other largely global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly to discuss cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognises that India is a developing great democratic power that should have more say and vote in international affairs but member countries have not yet been able to come to a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This question was not raised at the ninth summit which began yesterday in Marseilles.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the EU's acting president, the Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Javier Solana, the EU's chief foreign policy representative, welcomed Manmohan Singh, the prime minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double their trade in five years, to over 100 billion euros.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
The 26 existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonized, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India's top trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit turned its attention to global affairs.
The two sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism in all its forms and called for a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha round of trade liberalization was also pressed for, although both sides bear a great deal of responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, that is, until 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 per cent.
India also agrees with this, as well as the climate conference next year should reach a global agreement and reduce by 2050 by fifty percent the production of gases that produce greenhouse effect.
They also wanted to prevent food prices from rising and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is travelling to the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris was confident that French companies would receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be attending the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international trade fair for rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than 7 000 exhibitors from 102 countries to occupy the 171790 square metres of the show, with more than 403 000 titles on display and with Turkey as the guest of honour.
The Italian government will be represented at the opening ceremony by the Undersecretary of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities, Francisco Maria Giro. Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a 264 square metre exhibition space.
A meeting with the press will follow in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
The weight of books by foreign authors on total Italian production, and in particular on books for adults and adolescents, is gradually decreasing.
We found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane belonging to Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3rd, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Madera County Commissioner John Anderson has put to rest the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have confirmation that it is the very one that Steve Fossett was flying over the day of his disappearance" said in a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found on the plane or in the surroundings.
The 63-year-old millionaire was declared dead in February.
The American office for transportation safety (MTSB) has informed that a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, a squad of investigators has been sent who has identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal remains were found by a couple near his Mammoth Lakes home.
It's two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had earned himself a place in history by a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete a solo two-week flight around the world in a hot air balloon.
Three years later, I had flown around the world nonstop.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glock, the publicity you don't expect
An off-the-shelf SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
In summary, the GLC is the latest of the "compact" off-road vans from the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to provide a window of innovation in this sector.
The communication accompanying the launch of the GLK SUV, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will be unexpected and unconventional.
The advertising campaign accompanying the debut of the new car launched a new mode of communication through an advertising campaign in 3D, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the central street of the Milanese shopping, Avenida Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue as it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will get the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
In turn, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new GLK will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomputed into a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
With this formula, will it be able to capture the interest of future buyers?
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is being played.
But who are these 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they'd never met the rival's fans either.
The group extraction is on the right.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia has been added a small group (few units, actually) from the Campaign and from Apulia.
They have three-color flags showing the militants' hometown: Saturday night they were taken out so they wouldn't be identified.
They inspire the English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levski.
La Figc had made 144 tickets available to the Italian fans for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the minister of the interior had already checked them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none who had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crime, have been denied their tickets and their travel.
Now the Ministry of Interior is waiting to read the acts that arrive from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or who has been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) that prevents attendance not only in Italian stadiums but also in stadiums throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will never set foot in a stadium again.
Good for you.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others may be added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way", the Ministry of the Interior said.
Therefore, "eyes wide open" especially in view of the National's match on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, on Tuesday the CAMS which may also have a section of the AISE (Agency for Information and External Security, i.e. the secret service, which deals with problems in the stadiums).
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the raised arm during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ... "
This is the thought (expressed in an unfortunate way) of Domenico Mazzilli, who has been director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior for a few weeks now (he has taken over the post previously held by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste's head of public security where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behaviour of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the Observatory's number one, "the crimes are attributed to the countries in which the crime occurs.
So far this group has behaved well, now we'll see what happened and take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling to the hymn of Mameli: those too are not a crime, but if they allow it they are not of education either ... "
