The Welsh additional MPs are worried about looking like puppets.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should change to 'Member of the Welsh Parliament'.
The MPs were outraged by plans to change the name of the local council to the 'Parliament of Wales'.
People from all political persuasions think this is a kind of bullying.
One Labour MP said that his colleagues were concerned that it rhymed with the words "dumb" and "dumb".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp stands for dumb, and pwp stands for dumb.
She said her group was not entirely satisfied and suggested alternatives.
Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss a name change to the assembly, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Welsh Parliament to the Mariana Islands.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly's commission, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, made the statement: "The final decision on any description of what Assembly deputies are called will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the East of Wales the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on the proposals, which found broad support for calling the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the additional deputy title, the Commission preferred the Welsh Member of Parliament or MPU, but the MPU option received the most support during the public consultation.
The additional MPs will obviously offer alternatives, but the path to consensus may be a headache for the chair, Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce the amendment bill within weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the work of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of additional deputies and changes to the structure of the committee system.
The additional deputies will hold a final vote on the question of what they should be called while performing their legislative duties.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was held to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim to their territory, which has hindered Macedonia's inclusion and membership in the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are chiming, the side chapels of Harlem are fighting for their lives.
"There used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams, "as the old men I talked to said".
Today, neither of those are here.
He said it was understandable that the drums were disappearing.
"People have different fellowships and relationships nowadays", he said.
"Bars are no longer the cozy local living room where people go all the time".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the asset sales won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll be back to square one.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by condominiums filled with people who would not help the churches that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of the residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and that will hasten the day when these churches close together, because it's unlikely that the majority of the people who move into these condominiums will be churchgoers".
Both churches were built by the white community before Harlem became a black neighborhood  Church of the Holy City in 1870, St. Martin's Church  a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black community that was praying nearby, they actually got the building.
St. Martin's Church was seized by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants at Harlem's main 125-st street mall, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the faithful under the leadership of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they commissioned a carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the bell of the poor".
An expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: Cultural treasure and Independent historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first carillon to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who had moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that he had not been replaced at St. Martin's Church.
What happened at St. Martin's Church in the last few months has been a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by the church's invalid leaders, others by the diocese.
The congregation  governing body of the parish, which is made up of chaplain's assistants,  wrote to the diocese in July with a warning that the diocese  would try to transfer the expenses to the congregation, although the congregation did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while diving for lobsters in California.
A 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobsters in California was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and swam with the others to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was the excitement of catching lobsters, but then he realized something was wrong: "I was bitten!
I was bitten!
"All his little keys were torn", said Hamel, adding that he noticed it when he approached the boy.
I yelled for everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was airlifted to the Reid Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said at the media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the same spot a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained an upper torso injury.
Officials have closed the beach accesses from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esenitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to open up beauty departments in the department stores to trained beauty professionals.
As part of a major push into the £2.8 billion British beauty market that continues to grow, while sales of fashion clothing and home goods are declining, more big-name beauty salons will be represented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year, demonstrating success.
The reason why they're investing in beauty is because the supermarkets are finding ways to fill the shelves that were previously occupied by TVs and microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty products to offer up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw appearing for the first time.
Existing assortments from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in in-store departments similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The department stores are also re-launching their boutique beauty products so that most products will be vegan-friendly, and this trend is becoming increasingly popular among younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume store will be testing the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in south London, and the second will open in Sale Oak (Birmingham) later this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying small amounts of daily groceries from local stores has led to supermarkets having to make a greater effort to be more appealing to the visitor.
Mike Coope, the CEO of Sainsbury's, said that retail outlets will become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount stores like Aldi, Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has placed several Habitats outlets since it acquired both networks two years ago, which he says has helped grow food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
An earlier attempt by supermarkets to redesign their beauty departments and pharmacies was not successful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share revenues from the drugstore stores ended after a series of skirmishes in supermarkets.
The new strategy came three years after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business and the 281 Celesio stores to Lloyds Pharmacy for £125 million.
It was stated that Lloyds played a role in this by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy into four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said, "We've changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the experience for our customers.
We've also invested in training our staff so they can provide feedback.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need, and our attractive setting and convenient location make us the best home beauty store to challenge the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been raging after TV presenter Holly Willoughby scrapped an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for branded home goods and accessories Truly.
The couple's business has become similar to Goop's brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old news anchor announced on Instagram that she was stepping down.
Holly Willowby is leaving Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is leaving his lucrative clothing-brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was angered when the TV golden girl confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth up to £1.5 million meant she would no longer have enough time to deal with Truly's household goods and accessories.
The business was similar to Gwyneth Peltrow's brand Goop and was doubled to double Willowby's fortune to £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was Holly's top priority.
This was her long-term future, which she saw as coming in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left everyone involved absolutely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening on a Tuesday, and soon lunch was about to begin.
At Marlow's headquarters there is a warehouse, full of goods ready for sale.
Experts have estimated that the departure of This Morning's presenter, one of Britain's most prominent stars, could cost the company millions because of huge investments in goods from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and possible further delays in their implementation.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and husband Dan Baldwin had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Aunt McPartlin as ITV's "I am a celebrity" presenter.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We won't be commenting on his case".
We had a frank conversation, and we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for his comment, which they considered "un-presidential" for praising the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump denying a lot of things?
Trump said in his cheery dictator-like voice.
"I will not give up anything".
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was touted by Trump as a big step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearization talks have hit a dead end.
Three months after the June Singapore summit, North Korea's top diplomat Lee Yeong-ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not "received appropriate U.S. action" in response to North Korea's previous disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the US continues to implement sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're having a very successful relationship with North Korea", he said.
It could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a relationship.
He said his efforts to mend fences with Kim had yielded positive results: completing missile tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing U.S. military survivors home.
And he defended his unusual approach in his talk with Kim.
"It's easy to be on the side of the president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into that crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international help, so it was a bit difficult", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Paula, it's not clear if foreign staff can work on site.
Pantopa, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia has experienced regularly, the country is still well prepared for natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Ache, there are almost no shelters in other coastal settlements.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn of the tsunami in Pala resulted in more casualties than the warning had.
Even in its heyday, moving between Indonesia's many islands was a daunting task.
And natural disasters have complicated the logistics of the move.
The ambulance ship that was stationed at Lambock to treat the earthquake victims is approaching Palau, but the journey to the new disaster site would take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure and spent money on highways and railways.
But a lack of funding is plaguing the administration of Joko as new elections are due next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority embraces a more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool kicking the ball away against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by equalling the score in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Jordan Shakira when they were about 30 metres from Chelsea's 1-0 lead.
He did fin the ball to the left of himself before making a shot into the far bar.
The attempt ended with a high score under the top bar as the ball flew through the top right corner of the net.
The ball then went over Kepa Arisabalaga's head, which jumped straight into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position to push the ball, and players like Shaq were always pushing as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to buy us as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante running, made an easy pass, without thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 at the start of the second half after being scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blue's striker made a pass to Matteo Kovacic in this match, before returning to the half-back zone and running into Liverpool's half-field.
The forger soon found himself in the center of the field.
He then made a spectacular kick, passing the ball to Azar at the gate.
Azar passed the defender and made a low left corner at the far bar past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Italian Naples.
Chelsea are meeting Wigan in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Disaster Relief Agency said on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, a representative of the Soutop agency, Purwo Nugroho, said that many people were reportedly trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Palau, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered with debris.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he stabbed a woman.
An investigation into the murder has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55am with knife wounds in the Grayson-Memphis area of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for the immediate attention of anyone in the area who saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead or seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us".
I also encourage everyone, especially taxi drivers, or anyone who may have taken a video, to contact us, as they may have information that is critical to our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Friends of the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Moose had just tried to return to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he realized what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
A policeman was explaining to a man that the whole neighborhood was now a crime scene.
The woman began to cry at the scene.
She said, "That's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the fence, another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating the apartment building.
Anyone with information should contact the police department @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously on 0800 555 111, calling record 247 of 30 September.
The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell was the last century-old blow to rewrite history.
Its removal would be poetic justice for its Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate about the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell monument near Westminster Palace would be the object of this action.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the poor Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Ham Thornycroft's vivid portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of an actor many feel should still be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is known better than he is today since the late 19th century as the protector of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is a subject of long-standing historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is the uniquely recognizable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His achievements as lord protector also deserve to be celebrated and honored.
A pig-murderer maimed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man known only by the surname of  Yuan was found dead with a ruptured artery and bloodstained body near a barn in the Luopanshuai market in Guizhou province, reported the South China Post newspaper on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to introduce the vaccine to pigs in a pig pen on May 30, 2005 in Sinin in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He and his cousin reportedly arrived from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door of the adjoining pigsty was open.
He said there was a big puddle of blood on the porch.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that the 550-kilogram squid had maimed the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and bruised", said a cousin named Wu (quoted by the Guiyang Evening News).
CCTV footage showed Yuan went to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the piggy was locked up to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market administration are negotiating for compensation for his death.
Although incidents of pigs attacking people are rare, they have happened before.
Yes, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pressed a Welsh farmer against his tractor and held him until his wife pushed the pig away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood could act as a trigger.
They're just funny.
They're cuddly and very inquisitive... they don't want to hurt anyone.
"You just have to give them the respect they deserve", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring heavy rains to the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Hurricane "Rose", a Category 1 hurricane, had a speed of 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Euhenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a low-pressure area is beginning to form, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, and as Rosaurus approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching low-pressure area, will cause heavy downpours in the southwest in the coming days.
In places, 1 to 4 inches of precipitation will cause dangerous flash floods, runoff, and possible desert landslides.
The deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially much of Arizona, rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected.
The clustered patterns of tropical rainfall can lead to flash floods if conditions deteriorate rapidly.
It would be highly undesirable to go into the desert on foot because of the potential threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and the rains are accompanied by gusty winds and dust.
An approaching low pressure area will bring heavy rainfall in some places along the Southern California coast.
Cumulative precipitation of more than half an inch can result in a small amount of trash flow and make roads slippery.
It will be the first rain of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain will go everywhere in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
You can see some big temperature swings in the United States in October, because the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this results in sudden changes in temperature in the near future.
There's a good example of temperature swings in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the continuing summer heat will try to gain strength and expand again.
Many central and eastern states are expected to see a warm October with temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the Northeast.
The average temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.
More than 20 million people across six television networks watched the fascinating testimony Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Bret Cavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, as the political standoff continued, broadcasters interrupted their regular programming in favor of a breaking news story on Friday: an agreement, drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Cavanagh had grabbed her and tried to rip off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanagh said in his passionate testimony that he was 100% sure that this didn't happen.
It was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company took the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to the other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has a problem with judging people who watch TV in offices.
And just to give you a little perspective, the size of this audience is the size of a playoff game or the Academy Awards.
"Fox News, whose analysts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the entire day", Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The audience's interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Cowan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters were shouting his address and when he tried to get on an elevator to a hearing at the House Judiciary Committee.
He stood there for a few minutes with his eyes closed as he was being yelled at, and it was live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power, but many women don't have the power".
Flake said that his office had posted a statement and informed him, before the elevator closed, that he still had something to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks had several hours of live broadcast when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh under the quorum of the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would be looking at the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority Democrats are calling for.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's selection had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh at the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
During an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the front page, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson spoke out against her so-called "Brexit roadmap", saying that the proposal for the UK and EU to have a single tariff was "totally ridiculous".
The murder of Wade Sims: Police arrested the suspect in the death of LSU player Dayton Simpson.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder,  reported Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials showed video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shootout.
"Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA", WAFB, a CBS affiliate, reports.
Simpson was questioned by the police, who said he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The cost of the project is set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Investigation Department released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
Louisiana State Police Department Task Force, State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police are asking residents of the area to assist in an investigation that could lead to an arrest.
Louisiana State University athletic director Joe Aliyeva thanked the district's law enforcement for their "care and commitment to justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana State University team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what I've always worried about", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash on the city of Mexico City
Ashes from the eruption of the volcano Papacatepetl have reached southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Management Center on Saturday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater became active and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were reported within 24 hours.
There was a thumping and a jumping in the center.
Images on social media showed that neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, have thin layers of sandy coating on car windshields.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don-Goya, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with public order police, and thousands more joined a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarized vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatists, held back by the police, were throwing eggs and powdered paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, fights broke out when police used their batons to restrain the demonstrators.
Within hours, groups of independence fighters chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" were confronted by unionists present shouting "Long live Spain!"
According to local press reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions in the independence-hungry region remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid had declared illegal but which Catalan separatists had celebrated.
Voters overwhelmingly favored independence, although turnout was low, which was largely explained by a boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region following the actions of angry demonstrators.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to follow another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who is present at the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has any hope for the prospect of independence for Catalonia.
We had one of the greatest moments last year.
I'd seen my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we're tired", he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders finding themselves either in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jean Puche, who records the police protest on the phone, said that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more intense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in solitary confinement since the end of last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Nominating myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions that we have seen from the government of Spain", he said.
London: Men arrested after car-ramming home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident occurred in the Bellinagar Crescent area on Thursday around 7:30pm UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
Perhaps at some point a bullet was released into the car.
The result of the Men's shot is a 1-0 win over Livingston.
Dolly Mings first goal for Livingston secured them the victory.
The success of Livingston overwhelmed Rangers, and it was enough to appoint Steven Gerrard as manager of Ibrox after his 18 consecutive defeats.
Dolly Mangi's shot was outstanding, as Gary Holt rose to the level of Hibernia in the second division.
Gerrard's side will not win on the road in the Premier League this season and will face the leaders, the Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers in the Europa League hosted the Vienna Rapids on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling the sting after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses a chance because of the rude visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, but that direction caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed his shot at the goal, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's shot.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they might disturb them at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
A penalty was allowed by Rangers and Livingston made his debut, with Declan Gallacher and Robinson teamed up to overcome Mengu, who made a pass and scored from the centre of the field.
By this point, the Rangers were dominating, but the team's defense was found to be inadequate, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually uninvolved.
This continued into the second half, although it was actually Alfredo Marellas who saved Kelly's life.
The ball from Scott Pittman was deflected by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and the Leiths were far from the second set of Livingston.
The balls were consistently dropped into Livingston's goal and were repulsed, while two penalty demands, after Hulket was called in to replace Glen Middleton, and a penalty demand for the hand, were rejected.
The phenomenon is analyzed by Livingston
The BBC Scotland journalist Alcesteir Lamont at the Arena Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they've been fantastic, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and line-up have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top flight, but Holt should be given credit for the way he has steered the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was spectacular, building a well-organized defense, while Mengo kept Conor Goldson and Joe Oral all over the field.
The Rangers were not short of inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerard, they were not up to the mark.
In the last game, they didn't have the ball, only once scoring in the goal, which was something of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the line-up.
Mixed attitudes towards Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, smiles were seen and dreams felt as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They argued over issues of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkic people outside of Turkey.
The police cited security considerations to prevent the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large crowd of supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of whom were Kurds, also voiced their opinion, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The pro- and anti-protesters reflect the differences over the guest, whom some German Turks have hailed as a hero, while others have condemned as an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist killed in a collision with a car
A cyclist has died after colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 British time.
The driver stopped the car, and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said their officers were working to identify the man and notify his immediate relatives.
There are roadblocks and bus stops near the site, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Larkin Prison: Six staff members injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in a riot at a maximum security prison for men, according to the Penitentiary Administration.
The riots broke out at Long Lartain Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 British time on Sunday and have been ongoing since.
A special group Tarnada was called to deal with the riots, which involved eight prisoners grouped together.
Staff members were treated at the scene for minor injuries.
A Prison Service representative said: "Specially trained prison personnel were sent to deal with those who had caused the riots in the prison".
Six of the staff were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.
The Long Lartine Royal Prison contains over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And last October, the police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which officers were attacked with water-pistol bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which could be beneficial to dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but this is exactly what will happen early next week because of the tracks left by Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern desert, which create a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service released flash flood data Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to take a direct path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only 10 tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967), was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts rainfall drops of 2 to 4 inches, with some locations reaching 6 inches in Magallona County, Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to see 1 to 2 inches of rain, with individual drops of up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk zone of flash flooding, Hurricane Rose could be a long-awaited one, as their region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be useful, because the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a Category II extreme drought, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the uplands of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Sunday morning, Rose was still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph at 385 miles south of Punta Euhenia in Mexico, and was moving north at 12 mph.
The storm will eventually hit colder waters in the Pacific and eventually subside.
So, in Mexico, the approach of the tropical storm is expected to cause rivers to overflow during the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico can create a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of precipitation is expected from Baja California to northwest Sunnyvale, where up to 10 inches of precipitation is possible", reports weather.com.
Rose will then move northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue to move across Arizona and southern Utah into Tuesday evening.
The main threat is expected from "Rose" or its remnants, which are very heavy rains in Baja California and northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States, reported the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the highlands.
Midsomer Norton attack: four attempts to arrest murderers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the body of a 16-year-old girl with multiple stab wounds was found in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terrace Excelsior area of Midsomer Norton around 4am on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he remains in a stable condition.
The 17-year-old and two others, aged 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in Redstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
The police have been looking for anyone who may have had any evidence on a cell phone of what happened to advance their search.
"Cavanaugh is a victim of the Democratic Party's meanness and anger", Trump said.
"Vote for Judge Kavanaugh" "Vote for the repeal of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, East Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffers from the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christina Blaise Ford's accusations that he sexually abused her for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony at the hearing about her indictment.
On Saturday, the President said, "What the Americans saw that day was the brilliance, the quality, and the courage of the character of Kavanaugh".
"Voice in support of Judge Cavanaugh" is a voice for one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time, a lawyer with a distinguished record of public service", he told the West Virginia crowd.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of a Republican presence during the midterm elections.
Five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
"I'm not just late, I'm really late", he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump disagrees that Democrats intend to "resist and obstruct".
"The first key procedural vote at the senate level on Kavanaugh's removal is expected to take place no later than Friday", a senior assistant to the leadership of the parliament told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims rises
At least 384 people have died and many are missing as giant waves washed ashore as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Pau on Friday as six-meter (18-foot) waves pounded the shore at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The 7.5 earthquake was followed by a tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't immediately run away and they were the victims", said the press secretary of Indonesia's disaster management agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami pulled cars, logs, houses, hitting everything about the land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 mph) before striking the coastline.
He said that some people only survived because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palau centres.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The ensuing thrusts continued to scrape the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nuqroka called the damage "extensive" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
According to him, some of the victims' bodies were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Casualties and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, an area called Dongola, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter,  said Nugroho.
The Dongola link was completely damaged, said Nugroho.
"Over 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had been dispatched to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to report the tsunami in Palau, but officials say the waves came at a time when a warning had been issued.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately yelling a tsunami warning to people on the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell on the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that disrupted communications around Palau, and authorities were having a hard time coordinating rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but food and other essentials are still in desperate need of the evacuees.
The city's airport has been opened only for relief and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo planned to visit evacuation centers in Palau.
The tsunami in Indonesia resulted in over 800 deaths
This is very bad.
"As World Vision staff from Dangalla successfully made their way to the city of Palu, where the workers are hiding in the canvas shelters set up in their office yard, they saw scenes of devastation on the way", Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
This is very bad.
Even as relief groups began their grim efforts to get disaster relief mechanisms in place, some complained that knowledgeable foreign workers were being prevented from coming to Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start arriving if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level", said Auliya Aryani, the Indonesian Red Cross press secretary.
Once the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster", we can be open to international assistance, but that status is not yet in place.
On the second night in Palau, after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing hoped that their loved ones would miraculously be among the survivors of the violent storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday a little boy was released from the sewer.
Rescuers rescued a woman on Sunday after she had been buried for two days beneath the rubble, with the body of her child beside her.
Gendon Subandona, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including the others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his apprentices.
"Being a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Hendon recounted how within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's destruction spreading among the parachuting community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one grey tick, not two blue ones.
"It means that the messages have not been delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during the refill of ATMs in Newport on Levi's
"Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was depositing notes at an ATM in Newport on Lee's Creek on Friday morning", according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
"A driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money", wrote Dett.
While he was busy, another man ran out of the Brink's worker and stole a bag of money meant for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye (ty).
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
After announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I am officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, nicknamed Ye, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Along with shortening his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and the Bible is ty", West said earlier this year, discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
So I  it's you, I  it's us, all of these  we
It went from "Keyney", which means "one", to just "Ye" -- a reflection of our good, our bad, our depravity, everything.
An album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs has been variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he is leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-worker, Jay-Z, also missed the hyphen and the initial.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador pledged in the Plaza Tlatelolco to never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the military fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Abraador has promised to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly subsidies to those who study, thereby opening more free places in public universities.
"Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting youth to criminal gangs", he said.
The U.S. should double its funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes more active in machine intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on machine intelligence research", says Kai-Fu Li, a machine intelligence investor who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about the IP, even though the US has no official strategy for the IP.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled a plan that by 2030 it aims to be the first in innovation in AI.
"Doubling the budget for AI research is a good start, given that the rest of the world is behind the U.S. and we're looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling funding could double the likelihood that AI's next big achievement will be in the US", Lee said on CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book Superpower Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked American player, Athel, and later was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next visionaries.
"Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants", Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking out academic leaders; it's corporations", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies in recent years have hired university students to work on AI.
Lee said changing immigration policies could also help the US bolster its efforts in machine intelligence (MI).
"In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of M&E", he said.
China's State Council in July 2017 released a plan for developing next-generation machine intelligence.
"China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academia, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Machine Intelligence to bring together industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of the Task Force on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment in a new initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it's currently investing over 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence has not been seen in action for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the European Union.
In June, both governments struck a deal to include the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voter turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price to pay for being accepted into such bodies as the EU and NATO by Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Oliver Georgievski, 79, from Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have said they will consider the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name would require more than two-thirds of the House.
The State Election Commission stated that no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe", said 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje, Jose Tanevski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarica and his son Dusko vote in favor of Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name, paving the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want reunification with heads up, not through the official doors", said Kovdarkov.
We are a poor country, but we are proud.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of "this" would be "the affirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telekanal Macedonia showed that 57 percent of those surveyed plan to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent said they would vote "yes".
For a successful referendum, the turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum's defeat would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since his arrival in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the defensive line to the goal.
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling solved the problem of defending against Brighton with a 2-0 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguero made it easy.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the center of the field.
He raced between the three Brighton defenders before striking into the open.
Then the Aguero appeared among the four green shirts.
He overtook one defender and overtook several more on the edge of Brighton's pitch.
He then pushed a pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English striker's first touch in the penalty box was given back by Aguero, who used his right-hand shot to bypass Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan's right-hand shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs", the city's mayor, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
We talked about how he played for 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Serling who gave Sky Blues the initial edge in the Premier League.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
The Aguero got this ball deep in Brighton.
He threw a beautiful ball over the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Seyne made several touches before Sterling could reach the farther bar.
The attacking Sky Blues put the ball into the net before it jumped over the line.
City battles Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the point guard against Rocky.
After the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there was no particular reason to force a fresh start.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the hit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff consequences for the Rockies, who remain in the lead after one game against the Northwest's Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies clinched at least a unanimous berth with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to claim their first division title.
Even if it's just a game, at least we can deal with it knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is going to be shaping up to be probably the best I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have yet to announce the starting lineup for Sunday, but are reportedly willing to give Scherzer the ball in this situation.
Scherzer, who was about to make his 34th start, had his CPR session on Thursday and will be on his usual Sunday break.
Washington's Pro-Shot is 18-07 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referenced the situation surrounding his choice of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we've built is at risk in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
"I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm everywhere competing for the great candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power, using whatever means necessary, you see,  villainy, lewdness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to interrupt to get power and control, that's what they want, it's power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
According to him, the Democrats intend to "resist and impede".
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, backward and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee's earlier recognition of Senator Diana Feinstein's Democratic caucus, which received a standing ovation from the audience.
Remember what she said?
You let the document leak?
Uh, that.
No, I don't expect  it was a very bad non-verbal language  the worst language I've ever seen.
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's intolerance of those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to injure me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome to speak out.
My colleague in the House, Joan Ryan, was similarly attacked because she was a staunch opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor was scolding me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of sound economic policy, national security, Europe -- ironically, the same issues that Jeremy disagreed with our previous leaders.
In a message for the meeting, which was held on Friday by the East Nottingham Labour Party, it says that "We want these meetings to be meaningful and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party it is precisely such a meeting was on Friday
Unfortunately, the tone is not that at most meetings today, and the promise of a "better, softer" policy is long forgotten, if it ever was.
It's becoming increasingly clear that within the Labour Party, there is a complete lack of tolerance for diversity, and every opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as people I thought I shared political views with started expecting me to back off, and took positions I didn't agree with on national security or the single market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a barrage of insults on social media calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the centre-right policies, saying I'm no longer in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are made about me are usually politically charged.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face daily a flood of sexual and racial harassment, but never shrink back.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of policy is the normalization of the abuse rate.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party needs to build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer a party-by-party organization, and with every move of "uncertainty" or change in the selection rules, the party gets tighter.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years, to not give up, to not be so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, spurred by the Thatcher government's neglect, which literally made my schoolwork fail, I've advocated for better public services for those who need them most - whether that's a local resident or a government minister.
I've never been a political activist, not even during the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could possibly have been confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, as the country is heading towards Brexit, which is hurting our households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party.
But really, the only message I have -- this is not Nottingham Momentum, this is my voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of an election being annulled, and no political expediency, will stop me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr at the top
The two late attempts may have somewhat predicted the final outcome, but, without a doubt, the Eyre deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennant Premier League match.
They're now leading the table, the only side out of 10.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best odds, that made them their masters, coach Piotr Myrchy thought had every right to be pleased.
"We've still tested our game so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I should be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Give it to Air, he's got more than we have".
A 14-minute try by Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Klim, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unrealised try.
Climov extended Air's lead with a penalty before, straight into the break, he scored, then made a solo attempt, making Air's 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and a one-run shot by Patrick Anderson, turned by Bogot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruairid Noth, who was stretched, and after a restart Ayr advanced further through a Stafford McDowell attempt, implemented by Climaw.
Eyre, acting as Captain Blair MacPherson, was given a yellow card, and again Melrose had another man pay with the help of Bruce Colvin's failed attempt in late February's press.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for knocking Klims out of the penalty area without a ball, McPherson landed behind Ayr.
Climov carried his attempt, which he did again almost after the restart, after Kyle Rowe took a punch from David Armstrong in the penalty box and sent Gregory Henry's flanker off on the field's masters fifth try.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, game star Ford Kieran is about to enter the hotel industry after it was revealed that he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the show's last, and it appears that Kernan plans to continue acting after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun hinted that Kernan hoped to take part in the burgeoning Glasgow trade.
'Our Sea': Landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civilian buildings under the blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the motto "The sea is ours by right".
We have to renew ourselves.
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict over resources is still alive  as the quest to regain the Pacific flows.
Those hopes may have reached their highest peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it is waiting for a positive result", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calcassadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICC ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will uphold Bolivia's claim that Chile is obligated to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea after decades of tense negotiations.
Evo Morales  charismatic president of Bolivia, facing a controversial fight for reelection the following year.
"We're very close to getting back to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor, and if it does, it won't make much difference.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no jurisdiction over Chile's territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was not a difficult one, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing Bolivia, the last four years may have set it back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration", Sarat said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric, she said, had destroyed the remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it's going to be very difficult to have any discussion after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Velez, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of mutually beneficial differences", he said.
Calcedilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime issue as a political prop.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The challenge is to see what we need to overcome in the past".
North Korea says it won't go nuclear unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons unless Washington can be trusted.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Inter-Leaders' Summit.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of re-establishing nuclear deadlock diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Rhee says it is "an unrealistic dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections against the declaration of an end to the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are demanding a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows we saw a brand new line in massive headwear on the way to the stores in your cities
If you want to add to your hat collection or cover the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of unusual headwear on the podium for their SS19 collection, which exceeded expectations at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was bursting with unconventional hats, with designers sending their creations to the podium.
Valentino's signature was his luxurious beige hat, with the broad, feather-like spots that filled the models' heads.
Other accessories of unusually large size included jewel-encrusted watermelons, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
There, Brown also showed a selection of imaginary masks  just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipsticks and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One resembled a scuba diving suit with a tube and goggles, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue to hold on to the great attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Now, fashion watchers are predicting that these giant hats are going to make their way into our daily lives.
The oversized hats go on their heels to "La Bomba", the two-foot-wide-bottomed straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wears.
The iconic label on a very uncomfortable hat that was spread on social media has been given to another great creation on the podium - a straw-colored beach bag, almost as big as the model with this bag wearing a swimsuit.
The dark orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia trim and covered with a white leather pen, was featured in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on main streets next summer, as the designer has been very influential, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language is an essential skill for all citizens of the world.
Scotland's independent schools have maintained their record of academic success, continuing since 2018 with another excellent exam result, supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible experience for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as citizens of the world.
As the education sector that can design and implement a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages are ranking at the top of the league tables with the highest achievement rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who took the foreign language test got an A+ grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grade A in Chinese, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French, and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a vital skill that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Now, languages are now a subject of choice, just like STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission found that among the reasons employers cited for having difficulty filling vacancies, 17 percent were related to poor language skills.
So, more and more, language skills are becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their careers.
With more promising jobs that require language skills, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, learning another language will be a real asset in the future, if you have these skills for life.
Being able to interact directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
A YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013 found that 75 percent of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by the two-digit number - 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for kids today.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important to the UK in looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, independent schools will have a choice of several languages with teachers who are experts in those languages.
Scotland's Independent Schools strive to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
Now, there's no denying that in a globalized business environment, languages are still vital to a country's future, so this needs to be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and choice to the youth of Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward  director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron makes his debut on Sunday in San Diego
The beginning of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But how many minutes he plays is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be one more and one less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell wrote that James will likely play a limited amount of minutes.
As was the practice this week, James was asked about his plans for the six preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this point in my career to get ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia speech time, his YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a lot of the campaign stocks.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump speeches for next week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
By confirming the arrival vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is seeking to galvanize support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the votes are returned in November.
When is Trump going to speak in West Virginia tonight, and how can we watch it online?
Trump is scheduled to speak in Wheeling, West Virginia, at 7 pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia speech online below in the YouTube livestream.
Trump is likely to consider this week a Supreme Court nomination hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, who is in trouble over sexual harassment allegations with a Senate vote expected within a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to help Republican candidates who are facing elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will be traveling to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign official told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's event could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention to Pittsburgh, The West Virginia Metro News reports.
Saturday will mark the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is leading in the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come in to try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: US team advances to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's four-days may have been just what we needed for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging momentum lever is a completely fictitious sporting concept that players genuinely believe in, and nothing more than a similar competition.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they have four, so I think we're going to get through this with a little bit of momentum", said Jordan Sleeper, as they walked through the day.
Europe's lead is four points, of course, and there are twelve more in the game.
The Americans, Spitz says, feel like they've got a bit of a wind up and they've got a lot to look forward to, not least because of the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who've been playing together all day and can each boast three points and four.
Spaeth was a deadly T-shirt to green and is a role model.
These throaty cries of celebration grew louder as his round lasted, and he sank the decisive blow to be played in the four-field match when he and Thomas were tied two-for-two.
His punch, which won the game on the 15th, was met with a kind of scream, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team isn't out of the game.
"You just have to go in and worry about your own match", Spitzer said.
Already every one of those players has gone.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players who have scored more points than Speight and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup history.
Europe's weird but charming couple are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only couple that didn't make the gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday, and Friday afternoon.
This is happening, and as their energy seems to flow to this stormy crowd and from it, and this confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential win in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or the Malinari.
It's desirable to have both at the same time in different holes.
The talk of European glory remains timeless.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the breakfast show, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug out a Spanish and a Swedish hole, from which they were never able to climb out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your pit.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the patterns they make, the patterns they don't make, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has been the better team so far and has taken a significant role in the last day, but this fourth meeting also showed that the US team is looking forward to a fight that some doubted, especially in the States.
Europe goes to the final of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 score
Europe will have a good run on the final Ryder Cup day after coming out of Saturday's four-on-four matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Malinari led the fight with two wins over Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National's score down to four points.
European side Thomas Bierne, seeking to retain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American dissatisfaction this morning, taking the series 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in a four-ball match, winning two matches, but they could not do more.
In order to retain the trophy, Jim Furyk's side need eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who was nicknamed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball matches, they marvelously consolidated to beat a downed Woods and American rookie Bryson DeComb another 5 and 4.
Woods, who had held himself through two matches on Saturday, showed an occasional burst of brilliance, but he had now lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and fours matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested on x in four-ball matches, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in four-ball matches to defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  ranked one and two in the world.
Europe had not its way, though there was a nice, fresh day southwest of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time major winner Jordan Spaeth and Justin Thomas set the checkpoint for the Americans by two points.
They scored 2-1 victories over John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in four-ball matches and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit, going it alone, even though the Furyk's side only need to draw to retain the trophy.
However, after the next two days were better, Sunday's counter attack looks like they're going to get it.
North Korea says that there is no way it will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations is maintaining sanctions that are increasing mistrust of the US, and that the country cannot give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yun Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that last year North Korea took "significant goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a response from the US", he said.
Without trust in the U.S., there is no certainty in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way in the first place to unilaterally disarm ourselves.
Although Ri re-posted the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the "staged" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea was rewarded for taking incremental steps, his statement proved significant in that he does not deny the unilateral denuclearization announcement that had been made by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit of a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised to provide security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to lift tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on 'denuclearization' and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes 'the declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president celebrated earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added, "If this denuclearization issue had involved South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have become such a dead end".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, where he argued that North Korea's missile attack on the U.S. mainland was imminent after the evil President Mr. Trump called Kim a "missile-maker" suicide bomber.
At this year's UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said much more needed to be done, and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are arguing at the UN Security Council that Pyongyang should be rewarded for taking action.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council sanctions enforcement must continue actively and imperatively until we are certain of complete, final, and verifiable denuclearization".
The Security Council tightened sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the Security Council, and the General Assembly later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea over hours of negotiations ended with a visa application that he was making "gangster-like" demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle its missile and nuclear facilities if the United States took "appropriate action".
Trump said Kim had said "the measures" he expects "to be security assurances and a move toward normalization with Washington that Trump promised in Singapore".
Harvard students are taking a course in restful sleep.
A new course at Harvard University this year is supposed to encourage students to get more sleep, and is meant to challenge the culture of studying late at night with coffee in hand.
The researcher concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to properly take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a sleep specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by the TED talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning, he started a course.
And at the end of the lecture, one of the girls came up to me and said, "Why did you tell me this until my senior year?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep", "which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
And for the first time this year, a student-led course explains how good sleep habits promote academic and athletic performance and improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the Harvard Health Service, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students often go without sleep for weeks at a time.
It's an hour long and includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section has a dorm room where students are pressing on coffee cups and curtains and books that talk about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime habits.
In the fasting phase, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive images, encourages people to think about their daily lives.
We know that it's not going to instantly change the behavior of students.
"But we think they should know this as much as everyone knows about the health risks of smoking", Professor Chessler added.
He said there was still a late-night party culture, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation, which is proving to be a growing problem.
"Enough quality sleep should be the secret weapon" of college students to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, "even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry".
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, was assisting Professor Chesler in designing the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to require all orphan girls to complete a similar program of study before entering university.
Professor Chasler recommended that students be able to set a timer to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted from monitor screens and LED lights, which can alter daylight hours and cause sleeping problems.
Mengo scores a goal to Gerrard.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when Dolly Mings' goal ensured that Steven Gerrard would not be given a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
Aybrooks are keen to record their first win on their way to a 4-1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holtons team are bearing Gerrard's second defeat as manager in 18 games to leave their side eight points behind the premiership leaders Ladbrokes Hearts.
Mengo scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers, inspired by the goal, didn't look like they were about to lose.
While the Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, trailing the Hibs by a point.
The Rangers may face additional problems after the forward Colum Spence has to be treated for a head injury after being hit by an object thrown from the stands.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances, which caused Ira to miss the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levy under 11 that took the point away from Hearts last week, and was impressed by how well they had every step of the way outmaneuvered their opponents.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Livingston made more attempts to score the ball.
They should have scored in two minutes when the first time Mengele steered the ball through Scott Pitt's goal by Alan McGregor, and then the midfielder took advantage of that chance.
A successful penalty by Jacobs Keegan knocked out Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to deliver a strong kick from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game, they were more hoping to score than they were playing well.
Alfredo Marellas should have been fined 15 minutes before the game when he and Stephen Lawless faced off on the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson rejected Columbia's appeal.
The Rangers managed to hit the goal in the first half of the game, but former Aibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly nearly gave up Lasso Kulibaly's goal and an effective attack by Oviya Ehikaya.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute may have put Levy against further active play, there is no denying that they need to show the fans a good game.
Once again, the Rangers failed to break through Jacobs' goal.
Scott Orfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Mengele for a shot at goal.
Gerard substituted for Ryan Kent at the break, and it was a good hit as the striker squeezed through to Mariela, but the impressive Kelly came running and blocked the shot.
But Livingston continued to please the visitors by playing the game they liked, and Lithgow and Halkett continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was able to prevail only in the last minutes, but MacGregor played well enough to resist Jacobs before Littlefoot set off for the bench.
The Rangers' replacement by Glenn Middleton happened once again after a penalty, when he collided with Jacobs, but Thompson managed to dodge.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
A page from our almanac: Sunday morning, September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THEN... the day of the German-born physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Heiger.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the invention of a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter became part of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Bells of Carondelet, starring the seemingly little-known scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
LG: This is a Geiger counter, which is used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the sounds of atoms making radioactive noise in minerals".
Evans: "Tell me, is this really creaking now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new breakthrough vaccine could help the immune system detect cancer cells.
A new anti-cancer vaccine could help the immune system identify and destroy the bad cells.
The vaccine is sort of teaching the immune system to recognize the bad cells, which would be part of the treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the lab.
The cells can then "see" the proteins common to many cancer cells and then re-introduce the helper cells.
The trial vaccine has demonstrated successful results for patients with various cancers.
One woman who received the vaccine that helps her immune system recognize cancer cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear in 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory so they can "see" HER2 proteins common to many cancer cells, and then re-introducing them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer", said Professor Berezofsky.
A similar approach to identifying immune cells in patients and training them to reach cancer cells has worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West joined the Trump-supporting debate, bearing the I.A.M.A. title, after his appearance at the NHL.
Which didn't turn out well.
In a Saturday night talk show, Kanye West was fired after he praised the United States, and President Donald Trump said he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song titled "Ghost Town" in the evening, while wearing the "Make America Great Again" cap, he spoke out against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
How many times have I talked to white people, and they said, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon starring as a Hollywood star bullied over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the sexual assault trial of Christina Blasey Ford.
Although the performance was not broadcast, West's words were captured and uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Roque tried to mock Ouest.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having a hard time backstage.
They used to make fun of me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They made fun of me.
"And then they say I'm in a dead end", he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see a place of darkness?" "By saying he'll wear my Superman hat, he meant he couldn't tell me what to do.
Try to love.
His statements were the subject of at least two cancelled hearings, and the SNC was baffled by Verraetti's message.
West was hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of "I Love It" dressed in a Perrier bottle of water.
West was supported by the head of the conservative TPCUSA party, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support".
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and that's always great.
But I've decided NOT to reward anyone by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art, which I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that is damaging to my community.
He is free.
"As well as we", she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that his official name was now Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of the Diddy, aka Puff Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg, who calls himself Snoop Lion, and, of course, the music legend who changed his name to Symbol, and then him and the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was attacked in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the State Attorney's Office.
The Game of Thrones star Keith Harington was seized by idealized brutality.
Keith Harington is known for his sword-wielding and role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval action drama series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has been given the macho stereotype, which means that younger boys often feel the toughest to respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture section, Keith said he thought something was wrong and asked how to address the idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, said he felt empowered to tackle the issue.
"I feel like a personally strong guy - when have we been wrong with courage?" he said.
Why are we teaching men when they grow up, in terms of the attitudes we see today?
Keith feels that television is responsible for the appearance of brutality because of its very masculine characters.
And he said, "What is the beginning, and why do we teach it?"
Why is there this school, on TV and on the streets, that makes young boys feel like they have to be this confident to be a real man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change this?
Because obviously something is happening to young people.
He also said that the series would end next summer, and that he would leave the show and would not do any sequels or prequels to Game of Thrones.
Starting in November, Keith will begin to re-create the Real Western Sam Shepherd, who is a historical filmmaker with his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he sees his meeting with Rose's wife as the best chance to end Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in that series, so I got my future family, and my life here", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who is in love with Kit's hero Jon Snow in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS had increased by 14 percent.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, as it has been in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China by blood transfusions.
"However, the number of people who have contracted HIV through blood transfusions has dropped to almost zero", Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people still exists.
Because of the conservative values in the country, it's estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases spread through lack of education and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promoted universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address this global issue.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of data, danger and conspiracy theories by her staff to parliament
US Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dropped charges that her employee posted the personal information of three Republican US senators on Wikipedia pages.
The LA Democrat claimed the claims were against the ultra-right members and their websites.
"Lies, lies, and many disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the U.S. Sense. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate committee hearings on sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh surfaced online on Thursday.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source's IP address was linked to Waters' office and was giving out information about a Waters team member,  reports Hill.
"This is a completely false and unfounded claim", Waters continued.
The member of my team whose data, privacy and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations was in no way responsible for the leak.
This is an unwarranted claim that is completely false and completely false.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is outrageous", Fleischer wrote.
It just shows that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They should not conduct themselves outrageously.
They should not question the motives of their accusation.
They should be calm and kind.
Fleisher compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh when they were accused of being too outspoken in Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican Party candidate running for the midterm elections, also took to Twitter.
"This is the resonance if it turns out to be true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false statements.
"We guarantee that the culprits will be found", she continued, "and they will be held legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any of my team members".
The cover of Johnny English Strikes Again is a punch to the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
It's now a tradition to look for a meaning to BREXIT in any new film with a British twist, and that twist seems to be in the Johnny English comedy and action franchise that started back in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 with the title "The Revival of Johnny English".
Can satire do a good job of how obviously silly we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
At any rate, the second time he appeared in print, an incompetent Johnny Englishman had a chance to laugh at the things  his name was louder than all the comic creations that he had done for non-English audiences in the cinema.
What we know is that he's a secret agent who, for all his fancy claims to glamour, ended up looking a little bit like Clowes with Mr. Bean features and a little bit like the guy who contributed the only note to the Horn of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character was originally based on the traveller and international mystery Atkinson, who once played in a forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his wake.
There's some fun in that that we didn't have before.
I was like Johnny English, approaching the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the little rattlesnake thumping on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but the humor is felt weakly, and therefore surprisingly especially when serious films such as Agent 007: Mission Impossible confidently suggest comedy as a main part.
The humor feels as if it's not just for adults but for children, and even the silly mishaps of Johnny English are not as resourceful as Atkinson's silent films in Bean.
The long-standing premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret British spy community in Britain, revealing the names of all British agents on the ground, much to the frustration of the agent on duty - this is, unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a proud and mixed-up figure who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson makes a great deal of this quasi-Theresa May, but there is nothing of the sort in the script.
Her intelligence consultants tell her that since every real spy is going to be exposed, she's going to have to bring in someone who's retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself, things are getting difficult: now he works as a sixth teacher in several high-end institutions and gives lessons on how to be an open operator: some good examples here, as English offers Academy of Music espionage lessons.
Englishman returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and was reunited with his long-time friend Bo, again played by Ben Miller.
Bo is now married to a submarine commander, a role that Vicky Pepperdine has performed rather poorly.
So Batman and Robin get things terribly wrong in the Queen's secret agency, where they are re-hired by the beautiful woman, Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's hacker problem: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Beau begin their action with the obvious: disguising themselves as a waiter, setting a French restaurant on fire; creating a pogrom, fighting smugglers on board the luxury yacht Volta; English is committing anarchy, as he tries to use a virtual reality suit to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All moments are drawn out for the final event, but equally enjoyable and noisy, in which there is quite a lot of childishness in the TV.
It's a really good stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really showcased his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being drawn up to pay British workers for a four-day work week with five-day pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan whereby the British work only four days a week but are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company bosses to reward the workers for the work they've done in the AI revolution by giving them an extra day off.
It was clear that the employees were enjoying a three-day vacation, but would still receive the same salary.
The source notes that the idea is in line with the economic program of the party and plans to direct the country to support workers.
The union congress endorsed the four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the shift in the economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The planned review of the action will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen now, but the four-day workweek is an idea that is consistent with the party's vision and the overall industry strategy of regulating the economy in the workers' favor.
The Labour Party is not the first to promote the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party's ambitions are not generally supported.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a goal of party policy, nor is it a party vision.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a labor conference last week to lay out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the "sparing" CEOs and "managers" to the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also envisage that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire stake, as the Labour government may make a "dismissal" based on alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to bring workers on company boards and create joint-ownership funds to hand over 10 percent of a firm's own funds to private employees, which would contain annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told for 60 minutes that the FBI investigators working with Kavanaugh must change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been postponed for at least a week for the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether the Senate Republican Study Group's findings will be able to support it.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Paley asked Republicans John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about Sense: Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change?
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said, 'I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh,' as I walked into the courtroom.
I called him after it happened, and asked him why he was being charged, saying, "You did this?"
He was resolute and unambiguous.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
"I think Brett Kavanaugh decided that would be a scandalous accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denies it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
And all of those she calls "my friends" were unable to believe her.
She's only 36.
I don't see anything new.
What is the International Citizen's Day and what is being done to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday in New York City is the International Festival: an annual music event that features a very impressive lineup of performers and performers and has a mission to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on the Great Meadow in Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy a concert by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and learn about the event's true purpose: ending poverty and destitution by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project Against Poverty, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a number of tasks or "run an action", volunteer, email the country's leader, call other activists, and raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Citizens' Festival been for 12 years and has it achieved its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts really a way to convince people to take action, or is it just another case of "click-ism" that makes people feel they are doing a good thing by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the festival's organizers claim to have recorded more than 19 million  actions from their fans, who are striving to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions helped to push powerful leaders to commit to a bill of more than 37 billion dollars that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and claims worth at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include providing food, partnering with UK-based investors and executives, "helping children reach their full potential", and pledging $35 million to help Rwanda address the country's food shortage after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens across the world, we can eradicate this social injustice of malnutrition from history", said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 campaigns to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a food aid scheme that reaches 5 million women and children with food insecurity.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on the site, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The Global Festival replied: It will be a long and difficult journey, and at times we will endure defeat and failure.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the performers at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use the Navy for a "blockade" to impede Russian oil and gas exports
"Washington may, if necessary, use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the EU and Middle East markets", US Secretary of State Ryan Zink said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just like Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to use the Navy to keep the sea lanes open, and if necessary, to put up a blockade to keep their energy safe from entering the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event, organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less a fuel-balancing and replacement alternative", he said, calling Russia a "one-sided country" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase its CNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do so, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the uncontrolled Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into a Moscow prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is being built to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project has its origins in economics and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have a common view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans were dealt a blow back by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German organization representing industry, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) has called on the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
Speaking at the Halifax Town Hall in Halifax, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering joining the project.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and put our broken government in order, and I mean women in the highest positions", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
In a speech at the White House, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been openly critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, we need the FBI to investigate before the vote".
However, polling results released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "possible" voters said that a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names among Democrats discussed in connection with potential running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would formally make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin recalled her post-traumatic stress disorder, the PTSD, as she was driving to support Donald Trump.
26-year-old Treac Paulin spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through after he comes home is comparable to the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and injuries that our returning soldiers have on other families", she told supporters of Donald Trump at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called the arrest "a verbal question" and said that her son, along with other war veterans, are turning a little different, hardened, come back with the question, is there that respect that soldiers, pilots, other military fought for, giving themselves to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing a report of domestic violence, and carrying a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new policy on providing shelter
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia joined the challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical memo Friday in Washington to support the challenge to the shelter policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case Grace v. Sessions, which was filed in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner and his friends from the hardcore gang raped her, but the US authorities refused her asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the highest number of asylum requests in the United States, as countries with serious gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Reisin said Friday that the new policy ignores decades of legislative experience across the states, the country and the world.
"Federal law requires that asylum applications be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and a change like this violates that principle", the analytical note says.
The lawyers also said in the memo that "no-immigrant" policies are hurting the U.S. economy, saying that often immigrants can become entrepreneurs and "create the jobs we need".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop giving asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion", Sessions said on June 11, announcing the policy.
A refuge was never going to be a solution to problems, not even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Pala, the number of deaths has doubled in the search for survivors.
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"It's very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her feverish son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, a speedy machine brings the bodies.
Clean water is very little.
The residents began returning to their destroyed houses, picking up wet things, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, are outside the Palau Army Hospital, where patients are treated outside due to the repeated powerful jostling.
Tears came to his eyes as he recalled the powerful jostling he had experienced in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to escape.
"I was trapped under the ruins of a wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city to get married.
"I heard her cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to his wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of threats using propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper, touting the win-win of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the China Daily paid supplement in the Des Moines Register  the biggest selling newspaper in Iowa  after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congressional elections on November 6th, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials had called in a conversation with Reuters a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While placing ads by foreign governments is normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have waged a trade war that has resulted in the imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, US and Chinese experts said, were introduced to hurt exporters like Iowa businessmen who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the leading agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Brantstad in a Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, is now redoubling its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the good American tradition of free speech and a free press by printing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstead.
"And if you look at the newsstands in Beijing, you will find there are not many voices against and you will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese people may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, given the fact that the press is under the iron fist of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most influential newspapers had turned down an offer to print his article, though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans push back on women voters on the eve of the midterm election from the Cavannaos fiasco, analysts warn.
While many prominent Republicans are defending Chief Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will be met with a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion around this has been very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they're ready to vote.
"These things are not going to be returned", said Grant Rieher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Richard said he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) statement about the FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget this tomorrow and in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn to the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November's fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby when Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite a statement by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be tremendous", Stu Rottenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say they're already tall, and it's true.
But they can be even higher, especially among suburban women voters and young voters 18 to 29, who may not like the president, but often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said that the Republicans' insistence on corroborating evidence could lead to a backlash.
"For the Republican Party, it's become a kind of a mess", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets the job, it's about how Republicans handled it and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the News Channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided on the issue of Ford or Cavanaugh's rights, with slightly more advocating the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are very likely or not very likely to trust Ford's claim, and 35 percent said they are very likely or not very likely to trust Cavanaugh's claim.
Also, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the Flack push, the FBI is investigating allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a sworn statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, drunk, had sex with her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Jim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open source Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has permission to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that when he created Inrupt, he meant "to rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online data warehouses or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, fanbooks, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being accessed at once in the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal online data store is that only the user can control who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment powered by data".
John Bruce, the CEO of Inrupt, says that Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, the processes and the skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, a few developers working on the project under contract and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team had not talked to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change, where all of their business models would be instantly overhauled.
We don't ask their permission.
In a Saturday issue of Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network being built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential advocate for net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee would remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the web", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: a tribute to a priest awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was decorated on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Bellingglitz and Lecourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper's bullet and never learned he had received Britain's highest military award.
On Saturday, in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren attended a memorial service.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was very symbolic that the stone was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de San Quentin through a thick fog and under heavy rifle and machine gun fire from the enemy.
Then he ran to the line of fire and with great courage led the soldiers forward, grabbing the cannon himself and knocking out three units.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and the war ended a little over a month later.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I would never have been able to do and something that is also admirable".
He and his brother Dr. James Wang also placed the wreath after a parade led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said that "it is a great honor to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero was demonstrated by the support that many have shown".
MMA fans had been waiting all night to watch Bellator 206, they instead got a pepa pig
Just imagine if you stayed up all night to watch a pre-packaged broadcast from Bellator 206, and then you're denied the main event preview.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live all night on Britain's Channel 5.
And at 6 in the morning, as Gerard Moussac and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, the British audience was stunned when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after spending sleepless nights specifically looking forward to this fight.
One fan on Twitter called switching to a children's cartoon "someone's stupid joke".
In response to a question about the broadcast Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications said, "According to the government's order at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and we had to switch to a children's program".
Yes, the Pig named Peppa.
Bellator president Scott Coker said that in the future they will work on the show to take into account British viewers.
"I think we'll discuss the possibility of replay, I think we can solve this problem", Cocker said.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't solve this until Sunday, our time, and it's Monday, their time.
But we're doing our best.
And I'll tell you, when the apps changed, we got a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it by saying it was a technical glitch.
But it turned out to be government policy.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We're going to cut the number of catches down from six to five, like we usually do, and we wanted to please the fans, but we overdid it.
It's a very sensitive situation.
Tom Daley felt "unimportant" because of his sexuality
Olympic water skiing medalist Tom Daley said that growing up, he felt insignificant because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that not everyone was like me until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's Disks of a Desolate Island with host Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that after he had his first child, he began to think less about winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the traditional host of this rather old show, had taken a sick leave of absence for a few months.
As the man stranded on a desert island, in the first Laverne episode, Daly said that as a child he felt inferior to everyone else, because society did not accept those who liked both boys and girls.
He said, "I still believe that this feeling of being different and insignificant was what gave me the power and the motivation to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was somebody, he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint those who found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, he called for the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live in an open, unpersecuted way, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with the man - American writer, director and producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "it was a surprise to me".
Daly married the Oscar-winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said, "The age difference doesn't matter".
"When you go through that at such a young age", "He got to his first Olympics at 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer", "He said it was hard to find a peer who had experienced such ups and downs".
In June, they became parents, naming their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daly said that his "prospects have changed completely".
"If you had asked me that last year, I would have told you I needed to win a gold medal", he said.
"You know, there are things in this world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie: "This is my Olympic gold medal".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father hadn't accepted the fact that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked him about was whether they had bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics -- he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row, dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he wasn't immortal", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about my whole life", he said, "and to jump in front of my fans at the Olympics is the best feeling in the world".
This also influenced the choice of the song  Proud by Heather Small  which found a response in the preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are still running.

Mickelson, who is out of shape, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to get back in shape before the event becomes a disaster.
Mickelson, who will play in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's Forbo.
Instead of being in the spotlight, and he's been there often for the U.S. team, the five-time World Cup winner has divided his days between working as a cheerleader and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not a top player, and the 48-year-old golfer is not a perfect fit for Le Golf National's difficult course, where inaccurate strokes are punished.
And if the field isn't grim enough, Mickelson will be facing British Open champion Francesco Malinari in Sunday's ninth match, who, along with Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four of the week's matches.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in their first 12 singles matches, start with a good lead, this match against Mickelson could prove to be extremely important.
Fury expressed confidence in this player, but could say no more.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He is very confident.
He was admitted into the Hall of Fame and gave quite a lot to the team last and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two matches.
I planned for more, but it worked out and that's exactly how we thought we were going to play.
He wants to be on the court like everyone else.
Mickelson is going to break Nick Fold's record for the most Ryder Cup games played on a Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that was never quite as good as a one-man playoff.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Fury said his presence had benefited the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, has a sense of humor, likes to make fun of people and is just a very nice person to have on a team", he explained.
I believe that the younger players were glad to interrupt his jokes, too, this week, and that was a good thing to see.
It gives the team much more than just the game.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the Great Rift can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily be lost.
The Danish player made his debut in a 1997 match in Valderrama, where the European team led by Sevo Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but finished with a minimal lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Waldheim we had a big lead and won, but it's hard, we had a big lead in Brooklyn and lost", Bjorn said after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, and lose 10-6 at Le Golf National.
And what this story is telling me and everyone else on the team is that this is not the end.
We have to play our cards right tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
It's not over until the score is on the table.
We have a goal and this is our attempt to win that trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I keep saying this, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we know very well that they have the best players in the world.
Delighted by the way his players played on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
Tomorrow is the individual games, which is different.
It's great when you're on the court with your partners and everything is going well, but when you're playing alone, that's where your true golfing prowess comes in.
So the message to the players is, you have to be your best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, you have to go, and you also have to be your best individual player.
Unlike Björn, his rival Jim Furyk relies on his athletes' individual play being better than that which they have demonstrated in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these matches on the final day, playing on the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every word of it", he said, when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was setting up his players for the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you always want to have a quick start, like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
As the speed increases, the biggest pressure is on the middleman.
We've put together a setup and positioned the players the way we like, and you know, tomorrow we're going to try to get some magic.
Thomas is the starting catcher and will play against Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter playing against top golfers.
"I put my players in that order because I thought I was going to end it", said Björn of his choice for one-on-one matches.
The launch of a new German warship has been delayed again
Germany's newest navy frigate was supposed to enter service in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be operational until next year due to faulty systems and steadily rising costs, according to local media reports.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to enter service in 2014, but problems that arose after construction hinder this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships, ordered in 2007, are to replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful guns, various anti-ship and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar visibility, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics  longer periods between service  more new frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, the continuous delays mean that modern warships - which could allow Germany to demonstrate its strength abroad - will be outdated by the time they are finally put into service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy fleet returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media wrote about numerous defects in the software and hardware that make the ship useless in combat missions.
The software flaws were especially important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have only 120 sailors  half the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turns out that the ship has a very high weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, twice the weight of the ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
Aside from the defective equipment, the cost of the entire project  including the training of the crew  is also a problem.
The price has reached a whopping 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems accumulating with the new frigates become especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, said that the Navy had fewer ships capable of military missions.
He said that the problem is increasing with time, because old ships are aging and there are no replacements.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Monument Society eavesdropped on the secret lives of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands is looking at how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
Scientists hope to learn something new about the unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation efforts.
The National Monuments Society of Scotland's scholarly study is engaged with the small bats and also the large long-eared bats of Dobanton in the Inverurie Gardens at Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in this area to monitor the bats' activities throughout the season.
Society employees and volunteers will conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
Experts analyze the sounds of all the recordings to determine the frequency of the bats' calls, as well as which bats are doing what.
The habitat map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duarte, a board member of the National Society for the Conservation of Nature, hopes the results will reveal which areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information can help determine the benefits of creating habitats like grasslands and how to maintain forests for bats and other related animals.
The numbers of the bats in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, and so can fly-tipping and some chemicals in building materials, and so can house cats.
The spoken are not at all blind.
However, because of their nocturnal habits, bats' ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation technology to detect beetles and obstacles in their path.
The National Society, which is responsible for over 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct research, habitat inspections and, occasionally, rescue operations.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Trive estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says it's the perfect area for the bats.
"Here in Trier, we have a really great place for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a very good habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so our work here and in other estates will help us understand more about what they need to live better lives.
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before repairing property, as it is possible to unintentionally destroy one saddle, killing up to 400 female and young bats, resulting in the complete destruction of the local population.
The rhinoceros are protected and are forbidden to kill, intimidate, disturb or destroy their saddles.
Elizabeth Farrall, from the Bat Conservation Association in Scotland, is calling on the public to help.
She says, "There's still so much we don't know about our bats, and many of the species we don't even know about, how do their populations live?"
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, and his lawyers are about to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portugal forward and Juventus forward was accused of raping American Catherine Major in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo addressed his 142 million followers hours after the accusations were posted, calling the post "fake news".
I'm not going to let you go.
Today's reports  are fake news, said the five-time Golden Ball winner in front of the camera.
They want to advertise with my name.
It's all right.
They want to get my name out there, but that's part of my job.
I'm a happy and kind person", he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a court case against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in a private matter", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will demand compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation of rights, and this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palm House Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as documented in the district court documents of Clark County, Nevada.
Major claims that after that, Ronaldo stood up and said that for 99 percent he was a good guy who suffered from one percent.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted to having sex with her, but it was consensual.
The major also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries at the hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was very afraid of retaliation and worried that she would be publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to reopen the case because she feels a moral trauma from what happened.
At the time, Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Juventus, closing a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will always regret the loss of its car industry
The UK will "always regret" losing its status as the world's automotive leader after Brexit, says Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "worried" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily halve production at its factory in Barnaston, near Derby.
"'We need a deal,' said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker has said that the impact of border delays as a result of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Barnaston plant  where the Toyota Auris and Avensis  are made last year produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Barnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised the question of how cross-border trade would go if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is announcing that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what the carmakers are saying about the supply chain risks of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars that are custom-made.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be bottlenecks at the border, leading to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota will not be able to keep more than a day's supply of parts at its Derby plant, the company said, so production will be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's "Checker's" plan for the future relationship with the EU is designed precisely to avoid these border checks.
"We need a deal. We want to get the best deal that will not only make today a success, but will allow us to seize this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The information we're getting, not just from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, suggests that we should be able to continue to operate successful supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long the shutdown would last, but warned that in the future, the added cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has been working in Barnstone for 24 years and is a union coordinator, said that the union members are very concerned: "In my experience, once jobs are cut, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear plan for our future relationship with the EU that deserves trust".
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week", while the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, a White House official said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference, Trump associates' ties to Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the assistant attorney general, and thus jeopardizes Mueller's independence, has been fueling the Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using a hidden microphone to record Trump's conversations and the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has refuted this.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he did not intend to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a shootout at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh was confronted by one of the women who had accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's claims, which slowed the Senate vote even further.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox News Sunday program.
When asked about Rosenstein, she said, "There's no date set, maybe this week, maybe next week, I think it's more like a week later, given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court case".
But it's going to happen, and I'm always up to date with the news.
Some journalists are willing to challenge her claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
And the host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of briefings was not because of her contempt for reporters "working for the public", though she added, "I can accept the fact that they work for the public".
She then said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
"The president has held more press briefings than any president before him", she said, adding without giving any specifics, "We've studied these numbers".
Briefings happen, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than doing it through me.
And we're trying to do this a lot, you've seen us do this in the last few weeks, meetings like this where you can ask the president a question directly, that's a replacement for briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in street meetings or press conferences with high-ranking foreign guests.
Press conferences by the president himself are rare.
This week in New York, the president was demonstrating why when he freely and sometimes extravagantly appeared before reporters.
Health Minister wrote to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health system before Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU health workers in Scotland to thank them on behalf of the country and to wish them well after Brexit.
Jen Freeman sent that letter less than six months before the UK was to leave the EU.
The Scottish government is already prepared to cover the cost of residency applications from EU citizens working in the country's public service.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "For years, negotiations have been ongoing between the UK and the EU about our country's exit, leading to the expected decisions this fall.
But the British government has also been rushing to prepare for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very anxious time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from across the EU and beyond are bringing valuable expertise and skills that enhance and improve the healthcare system, benefiting patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we would love to have you stay.
Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Sunday's game, which his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player had suffered an injury just before the break.
"He went to the sideline and suddenly fell", Reed said.
The coaches and medics gave Abercombe oxygen again on the field before putting him on the stretcher and carrying him to the diagnostic stand.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Obercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were "no details about what the injury was" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine where the player had an injury.
Abercombe, a sophomore athlete, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five complete interceptions, making a total of 18 interceptions for the season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher duty
The Conservatives' new plan would see foreign buyers of British property pay higher tariffs and the extra money would go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes the success of the Corbyn initiative in attracting younger voters
The increase in government fees would hit tax evaders in the UK
The Treasury Department is planning to receive up to 120 million pounds a year in aid to the homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government duty and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
The move was seen as an attempt to counter the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters and provide affordable housing, targeting high-income earners.
The increase in government fees is aimed at individuals and businesses who are not paying UK tax and the proceeds will go to the government's homeless housing programme.
Increases in the current government fee, including higher levels adopted two years ago, on second homes and rental homes, can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury Department hopes to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it harder for new buyers to afford their first home.
Many of the country's wealthiest regions - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns", with many of the overseas buyers spending most of their time outside the UK.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in government fees for young buyers to make it easier to buy their first home.
He blamed the big developer firms for keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to end quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's housing shortage.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including rent control and an end to "unreasonable" eviction.
He also wants to give the local councils more power in the field of housing.
And Mrs. May said, "Last year, I said I would dedicate my work as prime minister to rebuilding the British dream -- to making life better for every new generation".
This means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build their lives here.
But it's also unfair that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy property as easily as UK-based workers.
For too many people, the dream of a home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: My main ambition is to lead the Scottish national team
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his main ambition is to one day coach the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is tasked with restoring a club from the north-east that is now in third place in the Premier League, three points from the top.
He moved into the job in the summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But it didn't work", Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland's Hampden Cup with my father, and something always made me want to go back.
But that opportunity will come if I become a successful club coach.
Ross's predecessors as coach include Sunderland's Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keane, Gus Poye and Paula de Cognac, who was also a member of the club's youth team.
The former coach of Aloao Athletic says he felt no fear of such famous names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now success for me will be to answer the question, can I bring this club back to the Premier League?"
"With the structure and the material base of the club, its place is definitely in the Premier League", he said.
Not just get him back, but I'll only be successful if I get the club back.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, having been an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped H.O.L.O.A. return from the third division and transformed St. Mirren from a loser who had almost been promoted to the Championship to the winner of the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling his work at Aloha, he said that it was a really important choice.
I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than playing.
It sounds incredible, because I was doing a good job, I was making a good money, and I was doing great.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things that we have to do every week.
I'm going through this now, when I talk about stress and pressure, but coaching is what it is.
I've always wanted to train and I'm doing it now, and for me, this is the best time of my adult life.
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Saturday, September 30th on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time.
The best time to drink a pint of beer is, according to research, about 5:30 on a Saturday.
A hot summer has boosted profits for British pubs struggling to survive, but has put pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the statistics, the pub and bar group saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurants saw sales decline by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting group, which compiled the statistics, said: "Prolonged sunshine and longer than expected England's World Cup finals meant that July was experiencing the same thing as June, when pubs increased sales by 2.8 percent, and restaurants suffered even more.
Restaurant sales declined 1.8 percent in June, only to worsen in July.
Pubs and bars, which are mostly drinks-based, have fared the best against restaurants.
Pubs that sell more food also burned in the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
It seems like people were just thirsty.
In pubs and bars, drinks sales rose 6.6 percent, while food sales declined 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and accommodation analyst at RSM, said, "These results are the biggest trend we've seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's no wonder restaurants are still struggling, with sales down 4.8% in the year, which is a very unpleasant feeling when prices are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst time for operators who are focused on food, and time will tell if the colder temperatures in August will bring such expected relief.
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a tool for tracking sales in British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups that have a combined £9 billion turnover, and is an important industry benchmark.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The study found that 1 in 5 children -- some as young as 11 -- have secret social media accounts that they have hidden from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rise in fake Instagram pages.
This news has heated fears that there are publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" account that showed their parents
One in five kids -- some as young as 11 -- have created social media accounts and kept them secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid rise of fake Instagram accounts that allegedly lead to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept "clean" "mainstream" accounts to show their parents, and kept private accounts as well.
One mother, who accidentally stumbled onto her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found out that her daughter was encouraging others to "abuse me".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, the head of the HMC said, "It's very worrying that so many teenagers want to create a place online where neither parents nor teachers can find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an observer member of the council at the annual general meeting of that body.
Doyle  Scotland's most decorated athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the event as a great opportunity for those in sports management to benefit from her experience at a wide variety of levels, including international over the past decade.
"Heild is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the global sports community, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her work on the board", said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to help lead the sport in Scotland".
An American who won gold in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and two other Olympic gold medals, and who now works as a pundit for the BBC, is unable to walk after suffering a micro-stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I made a full recovery, I learned to walk again, and now I do the resurrection exercises!

A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows has shared opinions online
A milk pump company took a different view with an ad comparing women who breastfeed to cows being milked.
To celebrate the launch of what is being called the "world's first inflatable breast pump", consumer company Elvie released an ironic music video ad to showcase the freedom the device gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in the barn with the cows to a song that has these words: "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, this is not a fairy tale, it's my breasts".
And she sang, "Dai, dai, I'll feed the children, dai, dai, I'll give my women".
However, the ad that was placed on the company's Facebook page has sparked a heated debate online.
And the reaction to the video was mixed, and many people said it was terrible for the milk industry.
It's a very bad idea to use cows to advertise these products.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are taken away a few days later", wrote one viewer.
Elvie's milk pump is hidden discreetly in the breastplate for the nursing mothers (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are not having their babies taken away?
Someone said, "Such a foolish advertisement".
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was "funny".
I think it's a great idea.
I wish I had one that breastfed.
Sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
It's a crazy ad, but I liked it.
"It's a brilliant product", she said.
Another comment: Very amusing ad, aimed at mothers who are sucking milk with a pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like kers.
It's not a commercial to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with invisible milk pumps hidden in their brassieres.
The concept of the ad campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely soundless, has no wires or pipes, and can be hidden in a breast-feeding woman's bra, allowing women freedom of movement, allowing them to hold babies, and even allowing them to leave the house while the device is running.
Ana Bollor, a partner and creative director at Mother, commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a distinct and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between lactating women and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight the sucking and the heaviness of the milk, while demonstrating in a fun and easy way how the new milk pump would bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the podium in clothes from Marta Jakubowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being quietly transported to a tent camp on the Texas border.
While the number of border crossings per month has remained almost unchanged, there has been a sharp increase in the number of detained migrant children, partly due to the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who fear they will jeopardize their own stay by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased dramatically in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would be required to provide fingerprints and data to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress about the agency's arrests of dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70% of those arrested had no prior convictions.
About 80 percent of the sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we continue to prosecute these people", Mr. Albenz said.
To speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, with shelter workers saying that the standard time frame used to be 60 days.
A large number of people will have to file their legal status statements with the immigration judge via videoconference instead of being in court in person.
Those who are deemed unfit to help are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources within the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer the children are held, the more likely they are to develop depression or increase anxiety, which can lead to outbursts of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions, like Tarnilly, these problems are more severe, because the signs that a child is in a critical condition are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent city without giving them time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many already have.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of occupying forces from the US, France and Turkey
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that has raged in the country for eight years.
Muallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "they will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must leave immediately and without conditions", he said at the Assembly meeting.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced from their homes, "the war on terror is virtually over".
He said that Damascus intends to continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly serving as instructors and advisers to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's ground contingent in the war-torn country is more than 1,000 troops.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions for return were favourable and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" by keeping refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear timelines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front militants, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new government-opposition committee soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why is Trump going for a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election, when, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal will not prematurely end his presidency.
And it will be, without a doubt, the most dramatic presidential finale in history!
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" drew 3.5 million viewers and topped the cable ratings in the evening when the main news was airing.
"It's the fire that people are reaching for because we don't understand it", says Neil Burr, director of the ABC drama "The Successor", about a Cabinet member who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nellie Scovell, the legendary comedy writer and author of "A Few Funny Details and a Few Hard Truths About Breaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She recalls taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because it amuses me", Miss Scovell told me.
Chaos is also a valuable source of entertainment.
Of course, unlike all other TV, the storylines coming out of Washington could be as future-defining as Roe v. Wade, depending on whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged of spectators can afford.
And yet, when you watch at the six o'clock hour as a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "private information" in Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket, and the implications of Storm Daniels's blunt descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy, it goes beyond simply wanting to be informed.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"Part of what he does makes you feel like you're watching a reality show he's doing every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's changing cast and the plot twists.
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you'll fall behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, standing outside the window of his house on the north shore of Kauai on a hot, sunny day with a high of 90 degrees, he sat inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't shake it off, not when Brett Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, debating the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging by a thread.
"I remember as a kid, we used to have these crazy shows, and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.

External cash flows are pouring into a tough election race in a midterm election for the House of Representatives
Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District was, unsurprisingly, in the money, because of congressional redrawing, which allowed two candidates to run for the same seat.
The newly repainted suburban district of Pittsburgh is surrounded by Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in last spring's by-election.
Lambe is opposed by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally cast in favor of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in campaign financing by the financial groups of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a prominent figure in Pennsylvania after his difficult victory in a widely-lit primary in Pennsylvania's 18th District in March.
It's a Republican seat that has been held for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have pointed to a slight Democratic advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already supported Beijing's position, despite a slight opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Trump's executive team.
The State Department has decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only applied to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings concluded, the North and Central American delegations postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which would follow on from last year's similar meeting, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and to actually stop considering whether to punish Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favor of hosting the event.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal matters on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by another analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
Teaching history
The next step could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, examples of which are now very important evidence in public documents.
Mr. Mueller is reported to have drawn attention in his investigation to the possibility of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will face accountability before that body, just as he prepares to address his constituents again, and perhaps eventually, a jury of his peers.
There are many possibilities, and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, as are many similar ones in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic, all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
History is wrapped around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these critical moments right now.
What happens when Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tight spot since the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president's speech and questioned his professional credentials.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times's translation is inaccurate.
How will we react if the FBI's recently requested investigation of the Brett Kavanaugh case is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the congressional elections that hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it could be a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the very Nazi regime that had occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on this swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eysen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, headquartered in Washington, D.C., and author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after a dramatic draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to secure their exit from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first start of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard.
"This was a crucial match for us, because Villarreal is a strong opponent", the 31-year-old footballer said.
We started the game thinking we could win something, and we got a point.
We may have had a chance to score in the end, but overall, the draw was a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second half we got our shit together, and we had a better half.
Thursday will be another big night for European football.
I hope we can get the three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they showed a good performance in the last game, but given the crowds in the stands, I'm sure we can overcome them and put on a good show.
The past year has certainly been difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have this confidence factor.
It's a great team, and the guys are really enjoying the game; the training is productive.
Hopefully we can move forward and overcome last season's performance and achieve success.
Women lose sleep over their retirement savings
And even though the women were very clear about the kind of care they wanted for themselves, few had talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in the national study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to discuss it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance nationwide.
That's a start.
Discuss it with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you don't make your wishes clear in advance.
Work with a counselor and the family to discuss where and how to get health care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining cost.
And bring in a financial advisor. They can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or you can self-insure your life -- provided you have the money.
Solve legal paper cases: foresee the legal battles.
Get a health care power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and to ensure that a professional carries out your wishes in case you are unable to speak.
Also, consider issuing a trust for financial management.
Appoint a trustee to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid when you're disabled.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly father is in urgent medical need and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about banned medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the financial issues but the professionalism of the doctors", Martin adds.
What kind of medicine is needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan it.
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
A man had been shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home that night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. local time, as an "accidental incident".
The victims had no visual contact with the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking witnesses to contact them.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials say at least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongola Regency, a district north of Palau that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Dongola on the island of Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
The Donga  regency, which extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
A regency is an administrative unit of status below that of a province, numbering 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important to the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morawa, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation, Palau and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the Donggala tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also hit western Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without a place to go.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence in the family
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contrary to reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is being held in the Matanuska-Susitna detention center on a $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "certainly innocent" when asked if he pleaded guilty, the network reported.
Paylin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Paelline has been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, had called the police to speak about the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin came under criticism from veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed by the tsunami
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of the attack have been circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palau when the tsunami hit.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City bombing.
The New York federal prosecutor's office is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saiful Saipaov, the suspect in the New York City bombing that killed eight people - a rare punishment that hasn't been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a used Home Depot truck in October to drive into a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors must prove in a notice of intent to obtain the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, both offenses are punishable by the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury stunned Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder in furtherance of racketeering; the count commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a count of assault and vehicular destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "careful and deliberate planning", and when describing Saipow's crimes, used phrases such as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolás Cléves, Ani-Lori Decadate, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Ernan Feruch, Ernan Diego Mendes and Alejandro Damián Pagnón, is stated in the report of intentions.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last capital case was brought in the Southern District of New York.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in New York in a federal case was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saiipov, a native of Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt satisfaction from his performance.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching Islamic State videos on his phone.
He also asked for permission to hang the Islamic State flag in the hospital's ward, police said.
He pleads not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saiipov, said they were "absolutely disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty instead of life imprisonment without possibility of release will only prolong the pain of these events for all involved", Pathan said.
Saiipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilising the people's army".
A former Ukip leader said politicians should feel discomfort with Eurosceptics since one of MPs Theresa May offered her candidacy for EU talks.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would have already "gone out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the problems Mrs. May faced in trying to reconcile her divided supporters worsened when the pro-EU Tories staged a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to save the compromising Chequers deal under constant pressure from both pro- and anti-Leave-Out supporters, and the EU itself.
The Allies are pushing for a deal with Brussels despite backlash, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the 'mess'.
Mr. Boone said at the Salihall Leave Means Leave rally that he wants to throw Checker off the board.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made an equal and put in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I am for Brexit, but we need to leave the Chequers plan".
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We did not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to follow our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely out of the question".
The Brexit supporter and Tory member Andrea Jenkins was at the march, and speaking to reporters, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Çeker's plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out on the streets and vote for us.
Please give up the plan and start listening.
In a blunt remark to Mrs May, she added: "Prime ministers stay in office when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that politicians need to be made to feel "uncomfortable" if they are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a question of trust between us, the people and the politicians", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "This is not going to get away from you".
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he said, "I want you to make our politicians who are ready to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, pro-Left protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis taunted the Conservatives over the security concerns they faced over the programme for the opening party.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have a ready-to-use IT system and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to keep a close eye on the presidential race
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after her election in November, she will "pay close attention to the presidential run-off".
The Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at the Massachusetts General Assembly on Saturday, The Boston Globe reports.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against Republican Jeff Deal, who was a co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of the discussion as a potential 2020 Trump challenger.
Since Trump's inauguration, this was the 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general assembly, which was held on Saturday afternoon in Halifax.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and to do that, it has to be led by a woman".
The arrest came after the death of basketball player Sims of Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that a suspect in the murder of high school basketball player Wade Simms Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the man who was in it.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning outside Southern University's campus.
"Wade Sims died from a gunshot wound to the head", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday on the channel 247sports.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to being at the scene of the crime, armed and shooting at Wade Simms.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games last season, 10 of which were starts, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Lewis Hamilton is close to the world championship after an inside-team win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's qualifying, it was clear that the inside of the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas drew a good place on the grid and almost left Hamilton to his fate as he defended his place on the first two turns and invited Fettel to attack his team-mate.
Fettel was the first to go to a pit stop and left Hamilton stumbling at the end of the general mass of riders, which was the maneuver that was to be decisive.
The Mercedes pilot pit-stopped for a lap later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after several wheel-in-wheel maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior space free, risking holding back after a double maneuver to defend on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid on his 21st birthday and was seventh by the end of the first lap.
He then led for most of the race while the tires held, as he wanted to finish fast to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth.
He was eventually stopped on lap 44, but failed to pick up speed on the remaining eight laps, leaving Raykanen in fourth place.
It was a hard day, because Valtteri all weekend was fantastic and proved himself a true gentleman, if I may say so.
"The team did a great job to take first and second place", Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianna Feinstein at a Saturday rally for insisting she was not the source of a leaked letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people can be "devious, disgusting and untrue".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the past few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see bad, ugly, and lying people", he said.
You read about press releases and leaks, and then they go, "Oh, I didn't do that.
That's not me.
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, is that your escape?
And you remember what she said, "You lost the paper. Oh, oh, what?"
No, no. I mean,
I didn't get anything from you.
Wait a minute. What's the matter?
"We let the leak... no, we didn't", he added, cheering the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing the charges Ford had brought against Cowan, and he escaped in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her story leak", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked that this story be kept confidential, and I agreed".
But that was probably very upsetting to the president, who said at the Saturday rally, "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations to their own advantage.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the filth, and they don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control", quoted by the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars  Belfast Giants 5-3 The team finished the season with a record of 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two touchdowns for the Giants in a game against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars played off Friday's defeat to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League, winning the return match 5-3 in Saturday's home game.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bavier's hits gave the Giants a two-point lead at the start.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney evened the score before Dwyer regained the lead over the Giants.
Dundee's François Bouchard equalised, and Lucas Lundwald Nielsen scored two goals to secure the win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's side, who beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time this season; the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Dwyer from a pass by Kendall McFall, and four minutes later Bavillier doubled the number after a pass by David Rutherford.
In a lively first period (13:10), Sullivan opened the score from the hosts, and then Counney equalised the score after a pass from Matt Markward (15:16).
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead going into the first period, scoring his second touchdown of the game at the end of the first period.
The receiving side regrouped, and Bouchard again equalised, scoring a goal in the team's numerical advantage (27:37).
Coon and Charles Carcorran helped Nielsen take Dundee to a first-time match lead late in the second period, and he secured the win along with the team's number five in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their final home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A dispatcher dies while saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia died a heroic death after ensuring a successful takeoff of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Massive earthquakes are still ongoing, with many people buried under the rubble in the city of Paola.
While his colleagues were fleeing, 21-year-old Antônio Gunawan Agong refused to leave his post in the control tower that was rocking wildly at the Palua Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained in the area until the 6321 of the company Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was torn off the ground.
Then he sprang out of the control tower when he decided it was falling.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australian program ABC News, Johanes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died that morning, before the helicopter could get to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken", he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities fear the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the Disaster Risk Reduction Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigai and Bhutan is restricted.
The agency's spokesman Purva Nugroho reported: "The number of victims may still increase, as many bodies are still not able to be dug up from the wreckage".
Waves as high as 20 feet (6 m) swept across the city of Pau, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in humanitarian aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A car is coming every minute to bring the bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
There are shoplifting attacks everywhere.
Jan Gelfond, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what awaits them here.
It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and told the military, "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?   reports CNN
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by the Lambooka earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: One person reported missing in Niugini Air after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline operating the flight that made an emergency landing in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from the sinking plane, and is now reporting the disappearance of one passenger without a trace.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday, it could not report on the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately disclose details such as the passenger's age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water while attempting to land at Chukchi Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were hospitalized.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday; all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane landed in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses reported that the plane had skipped the runway.
The plane was flying very low, according to an American passenger, Bill Gaines.
"That's very nice", reported Jane.
He said he and the others were able to get through the waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was already sinking.
He said that the stewardesses panicked and started screaming, and also that he had a slight head injury.
The US Navy reports that sailors who were repairing nearby docks also assisted in the rescue, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in crashes of Papua New Guinea-registered aircraft over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst recalls the course of events on the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed a presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of 29-year-old deputy Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he obtained location information from several cell phones that showed that Thales was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statement.
When the evidence that his cell phone was near Chambers's phone at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford was confirmed, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford gave his testimony on Saturday and confirmed that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tallis was telling the truth about what Sanford had done that night in the van, he said it was a lie, since my van was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was Tallis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
According to Rowlett, some time after Chambers' death, Tallis deleted her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Haley said.
The defense side should start the argument on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be submitted to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by infusing their music with positive attitudes.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, states that hip-hop has become distant from its origins: political statements and social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Akala and Lowkey brought back the popularity of bands like The Fugees and Common in the UK.
Another black woman?!
A nanny in New York sues a married couple for a racist post after being fired
A New York nanny sues her husband for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a randomly sent message from her mother complaining that she was "just another black person".
The couple denies they are racists, equating the suit to "extortion".
In 2016, Lindsay Plaska-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment at finding that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was  black when she arrived on her first day of work.
"NO, I'M A BLACK WOMAN", wrote Mrs. Plasca-Flaxman in a note to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
As reported by the New York Post, "realizing the mistake, 'I felt awkward' Placebo-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, claiming that the previous nanny, who was also African-American, was not doing well and that she had waited for a Filipino instead".
Miss Morris got paid for the day and was sent home by an Uber.
Now Morris is suing for damages and wants to be compensated for her dismissal under the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months with residency.
"I want to show them that it's not right", she told the Post on Friday. "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, arguing that firing Morris was a wise move given that they could not trust her after they had insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", the Post's husband, Joel Plasca, told the Post.
Would you trust your children to someone who was rude to you, even accidentally?
Her baby?
Is that so?
Plasko equates the claim to "borrowing" and reports that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
And you would persecute a man in this position?
"It's pretty tough", added the investment banker.
While the court case is still ongoing, public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, sharply criticizing their behavior and logic.
Padington's publishers feared readers would not empathize with the talking bear, says the new paper.
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, wrote of the letter: "It's hard to put myself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's so interesting to read, knowing all about the huge success of Paddy's.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before daring to write a children's book about a teddy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work was rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success, speaking of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a rather quiet man, and not at all boastful", she said.
But because Padington was so real to him, it was almost a parental sense of pride for a kid who had accomplished something, feeling proud of it, even though it wasn't really your own.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave his due to the Padington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the transplant, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"Nad has called regularly to tell me that everything is really bad, that she can't stand it", said Mrs. Edna-Lapperuse.
Then she rang me over to say that she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors had given her to make her heart beat was slowly leaving her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the very end.
I just sat there, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't groan, or scream, or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should have held on".
Finally, Mrs. Edna LaPeruise, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers - they had no idea what she had gone through.
"No one knew", she said.
I bowed my head, and tears were streaming down my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Sad women hanging postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are doing what they can to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards with warm words and helpline numbers on a bridge in Wales.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered his first bout of depression, and at 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the way I feel", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lived in Leeds, said her son was a gifted chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew his smile.
People have said that his smile lights up any room.
However, before he died, he abandoned the work because it was "a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that there might be some unpleasant consequences to this".
Ms. Davis created the greeting cards to let people know that there is someone in the world that you can always talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent  you have to talk.
Ms. Hasphris, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he was sad or that he was depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On the holiday he was very depressed: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but it was something that they had to live with: a huge hole in the family.
It's just killing us.
But you have to keep living and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in doubt as the FBI launches an investigation.
"I thought we could have what he wanted -- a time-limited and a hawkish investigation -- we could get a little bit of a reconciliation", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was being dissolved because of the fact that it was actually stuck in traffic.
Why would Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican cronies want to stop the FBI from investigating?
Their reluctance is sometimes explained.
Midterm elections just five weeks away, November 6th - if the Republicans are expected to suffer a defeat, then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect their favorite Supreme Court nominee.
George W. Bush called senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Cavanaugh, who had worked in the White House under Bush and through him had introduced his wife, Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to address the vote-balance issue and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors have declined under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo-sung, citing South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reasons were increased border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees charged by smugglers for smuggling.
Pyongyang has not commented on the report.
Most of the northerners eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of the people fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South -- which are technically still at war -- has improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This followed the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed to common terms to work towards the goal of completely denuclearising the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yang Ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in this case, we are not going to disarm first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric", she says he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unsuitable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman did that, she would be called a 'hysteric'", Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh's speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was highly emotional, sometimes even shouting and unable to speak as his family and the school's senior classes were discussing.
He also explicitly blamed the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "a gratuitous and organized character assassination" by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's speech showed he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he had clearly shown his bias against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he were elected and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll say it this way, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only should he not be on the Supreme Court, he should be on the court where he is now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against the Affordable Care Act or in the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not say whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for hysterical, unobjective individuals to work in court and expect us to say 'how wonderful'", Pelosi said.
And women should be able to do that.
This vindictive speech, months and years of anger just poured over, and she could not recall it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Stein told me 45 years ago.
I don't think it's that rare.
And she went on, and she said, "Well, I've had a lot of help from a female principal somewhere, and she said that when she was angry, she would cry, but she had developed a technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the interviewer, 'You might think I'm sad, because I'm crying.
But I'm mad.
And she just kept going.
I think it was great.
Tears are allowed in part as an outlet for grief because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my first job, where I was crying inexpressibly, was when I was grabbed by the collar by an elderly woman -- a very reserved supervisor, who was always a little intimidating -- and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let yourself be seen in tears", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored and they'll be glad they brought you.
Patricia Schroder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was caught cheating on his yacht Monkey Business and pulled out of the presidential race, an angry Mrs. Schroder thought she might be a candidate herself.
"That was not a very well thought out decision", she told me laughingly 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates, and they didn't need me at all.
Someone called this "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had been going on for quite some time, she had run out of funds, so she said that she would not run for office unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her fans who had donated $1,000 to the men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm going with a spare?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion -- gratitude to the people who had supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and targeted voters instead of candidates, and anger at sexism -- that it took her breath away.
"You might think I'm having a breakdown", recalled Mrs. Schroder of the press reaction to her condition.
You would think my corporate sponsor is the paper towel company Kleenex.
I used to wonder, what would they write on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?
Why a trade war between China and the United States could be good for Beijing
The initial flares in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and since the war is far from over, in the long run, the friction between the two countries could be to Beijing's advantage, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on China's main export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week when the new tariffs affected goods worth a total of $200 billion, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has responded in the same way every time, recently raising tariffs from 5 percent to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to see it coming.
To get Washington to back down, you have to go deeper in demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. is virtually unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages the situation well, the pressure of the US trade war could support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would start a process of economic downturn is much more dangerous than observers previously thought", said Abigail Grace, a research assistant specializing in Asia at the Center for American New Security.
Syria ready for return of refugees says foreign minister
Syria has said it is ready for the return of refugees and has called for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallim stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
We now have a global platform for returning refugees to the countries they were forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that are designed to improve their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are six million more people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. will lose for the sixth time in a row on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was crowned champion when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been the most competitive player in the tournament, scored his own goal in the water on the 3rd of the 16th hole, conceding the match to Francesco Malinari.
Italian golfer Malinari played brilliantly in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to have passed this field with a 5-0-0 record since the tournament's inception in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was beaten 5 to 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thornbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time leading scorer with a career total of 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to return my cup.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said the excited Garcia after the European team's victory.
He gave the baton to his compatriot John Ramm, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods in a singles match 2&1 on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to beat Tiger Woods, a man I've followed since I was a kid", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
The amazing statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team was competing with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tina Fines, who played throughout the tournament top-class golf.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning we have shown Europe what it can do.
We fought.
Let's take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the USGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hats in front of them.
We were tricked.

The red tide flows approximately 130 miles (200 km) of shoreline from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Fragments of the bloom can be found about 10 miles (15 km) offshore in Hillsborough County, but the number has been decreasing since last week.
The Red Tide was also seen in Pasco County.
A medium-sized concentration on or near the shore in Pinellas County was observed last week, in Hillsboro the concentration was low to high. in Manatee the background was high, on or near the shore in Saratoga County the concentration was low to high, in Charlotte County from low to medium, on or near the shore in Lee County from low to high and in Collier County the concentration was low.
Respiratory tract irritation has been reported from Pinellas, Monathee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory tract irritation in Northwest Florida in the past week.
