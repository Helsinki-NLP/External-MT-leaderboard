European food inflation has slipped
The acceleration in euro area inflation is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The euro area's 13 countries saw higher-than-expected price increases in November, with annual inflation of 3.1% recorded after 2.6% in October, the EU's Luxembourg office for statistics reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely, according to Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the key interest rate, unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, saying that a cut would lead to an inflationary spiral, combined with rising commodity prices and easing unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but close to, 2%.
One analyst believes that the ECB is in the trap of the Twenty-second Rule: it must "talk" about inflation so that it does not have to act on it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent is a 12-year high; in Spain, it rose to 4.1 percent from 3.6.
Eurozone inflation has been fuelled by soaring food and energy prices.
Wheat futures rose 88 percent, and the price of soybeans reached its highest since 1973.
The price of cooking oil and milk products also increased significantly in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil has increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it was nearly $100 a barrel for a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1% to 2.5% this year in 2008 but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts expect 12-month inflation to remain around 3% for the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to have cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz's support base grew significantly in early December after a long period of stagnation, and it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has never measured socialist support at such a low 13 percent.
The difference between the party-elected commissioners - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71%) support against the support of one-fifth (20%) of the MSZP.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold in the survey: their support within the population as a whole is two percent.
Among the voters who vote for the party of the future, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
Economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate from the previous low, reaching an all-time high of 41 percent of those who expressly considered the country's economic situation to be very bad, and 46 percent who said the situation was quite bad.
The change in the families' own financial situation is now seen as more pessimistic again after the more hopeful prospects of spring and summer.
For the next year, the top half of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth to improve.
In December, more than any previous Gallup poll, 71 percent of respondents thought the prime minister was doing a bad job than a good job.
Gyurcsány Ferenc is trusted or very trusted by 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán has a 38% support ratio.
The Prime Minister is not trusted at all by 54 percent, the Fidesz president is 27 percent.
One indicator of the political situation is how much of the society thinks that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While 35 percent of the population wanted the government and the prime minister to stay in place after the October riots last year, only 20 percent now see a new election as the only solution, and a relative majority (33 percent) do.
The interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to a question on their intention to participate say they would definitely go, and another 20 per cent say they would probably go.
By comparison, in a "parliamentary election to be held on Sunday", only 55 percent would definitely participate and another 15 percent would consider it likely.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition, 79 percent to visitation, and 84 percent to hospital fees.
If we look at the same percentages among those who have just promised to take part in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition, utilities and hospital allowances.
The most expensive is Auchan, up almost a fifth from Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Buda district have kept the average price increase of last year at 16%, with the difference that this year no VAT has been raised.
The Daily Economy article is
This year, the average daily Christmas basket in the Budapest shopping triangle increased by 16%, but in all the hypermarkets the increase was well over a thousand forints.
Since food prices had already "lifted" in December last year, the drastic increase in prices was no longer a percentage of the previous high base.
But it's obviously scary for consumers that what they could get for $9,000 last year, they can't get for $10,000 now.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of 10 000 forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest bid was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the basket was 6800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and live fish has remained almost at last year's level, but turkey camellias, nuts and mackerel have also risen sharply.
The KSH data followed the price of flour and bread in the shops, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product below 200 forints.
Also surprising in this store was the fact that the price of a two-liter recoverable bottle of Coca-Cola was under $200, so they were charging only $257 for the product, including the deposit.
However, this year, Auchan was the most expensive car in the Daily Basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
We calculated that Cora 15 and Tesco and Auchan have increased the prices of the daily basket by about 18-18 percent compared to last year's Christmas prices.
The difference between the most expensive basket last year and the cheapest basket this year was 12 percent, while the difference between the most expensive basket last year and the cheapest basket this year was 21 percent.
The increase in the average forint was 1,480.
Last year, the average price increase came out to 1,206 forints, with the effect of the VAT increase on prices felt last Christmas.
This process was the one that disrupted trade, as the stores were clearly unable to decide how much to charge for a product, unable to calculate how the price change would affect consumption.
(If a trader's planning of a product's turnover rate is poor, he may lose a significant profit on the margin adjusted for turnover.)
The price of the Napi basket was so drastically increased last year because of the VAT that the most expensive one was 1720 forints more than the 2006 value, while the cheapest one had a price difference of only 844 forints.
This year, the extreme was not the case, as the current highest price was $1,630 more than last year, and the lowest price was $1,284.
The two Christmas seasons combined to produce a catastrophic increase in prices, with daily consumer items in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily justify the KSH data: the statistical office measured price increases of more than 30% for some basic foods over 12 months.
For example, flour and eggs.)
According to the daily newspaper Napi, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, since the price range of the rather expensive product already last year produced a price increase of barely 10% compared to the base price in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the egg producers, having managed to outsmart the drastic price increases in the multicultural market.
In the commercial golden triangle, the hypers don't complain, they keep reporting good years.
In our experience, in the three stores we visited, most customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantities of everything, they take the durable food on a platter.
On Wednesday morning, lines of shoppers lined up in front of the cash registers in all three stores because of the sudden increase in the number of visitors.
But we know that in rural areas, traffic is lower, and many companies complain to research companies that even their plans are not profitable, not just for food but also for consumer durables.
Many places are sparingly using disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals, mostly due to the misuse of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions in hospitals, overcrowded beds, and overloaded staff are not conducive to stopping infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
They're also sparing on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
A man recovering from a serious accident has been found to have antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The patient has been isolated.
There was a similar infection earlier this year.
A victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but soon returned with an MRSA infection and a major operation that had been delayed because of the bacteria in his system.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-drug-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Dr. Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens must have been registered in hospitals, the rest unknown.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium is carried in the nose of one third of the population without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. laryngitis, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) are well-receptive to antibiotics and are well-treatable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or improperly, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and spread rapidly in the wrong hospital environment.
Primarily, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsis, in elderly or low-weight patients with transient or persistent immune system dysfunction.
According to the medical director of the John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, such infections are part of the daily routine of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA just isn't there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where they don't test for the pathogen.
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the nursing staff see the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the appropriate antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients who are admitted to hospital are first screened for MRSA, but this is not always the way to avoid infection.
It's not fashionable to sample
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not conducive to preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals, nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients entering and should immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these studies also plays a role in this.
Most cases are detected when the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the epidemiology center's chief medical officer.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are national guidelines for treating certain infections and conditions.
The aim should be to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. to carry out microbiological tests to prevent the development of drug resistance, but this is not always adhered to by hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, said Böröcz Karolina.
They save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from patient to patient by healthcare workers.
So hand washing, gloves, masks are very important, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by contact, drop-in infection, but isolation of an infected patient is not always possible in the hospital environment in the country.
In fact, the wards were often crowded, with beds often very close to each other, whereas epidemiologically, patients should be at least five feet apart.
Unfortunately, noted Karolina Böröcz, hospitals in disadvantaged financial situations are often short on disinfectants, have few nurses, many patients, and thus are more prone to infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are taken, such infections can be detected less often or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so they're fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, it has included the prevention and reduction of MRSA in government programmes.
The programme appears to be successful, with the data reported showing a declining trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital-acquired infections caused by these pathogens as a priority.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion is ready for the XXII district police captain's fatal accident.
It is unlikely that he drove drunk or intoxicated, and that he resigned from his post as the police captain of the XXII district, who on Tuesday trampled a pedestrian to death, informed Attila Morvai, the spokesman of the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the expert opinion on this was prepared.
The expert opinion confirmed the preliminary findings, which already established that the former police captain had not consumed alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII district police station, driving his own car, hit a 55-year-old man on Tuesday as he turned a corner in the street of Lajos Kossuth in the XXII district, trying to cross the pedestrian crossing.
(The latter, that the pedestrian does not cross the zebra, is not a mitigating circumstance under the rules of the CRESZ, and the man in the corner must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
The incident led the district police chief to resign his post and ask to be placed on leave, police said, because he was so shocked by the incident.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also revealed that the former police captain had cooperated with the prosecutors from the very beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three framework loan agreements worth a total of €400 million for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy were signed with Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million budgetary envelope for the financing of transport and environmental projects in Hungary under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which a EUR 100 million loan agreement had already been concluded between the parties, the contract signed now concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The loan agreement for EUR 150 million also provides budgetary financing for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later, by extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract worth EUR 50 million, which will be used primarily for the research and development project at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the 4th Metro.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary totalling EUR 8.4 billion.
The EIB provides interest-bearing loans linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a reserve premium.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradigm
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of all Europe is focused on the previously little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying in the EU's still cheapest but fastest growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after property in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the hills, the most fashionable are the Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa areas, and on the coast are Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sunshine Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebár, but more and more people are looking for real estate in the area of Kavarna and Balcsik.
Re/Max Bulgaria analysts believe that sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract investors - Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are also buying in the allegedly cheap Rusz area.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces offering the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to becoming one of the most attractive golf parks in Europe, making it a top destination in both the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-looking investors are already buying in bulk, for example in the Banszko area.
Analysts say that buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also looking to change their lifestyle.
Most of the customers are British, but there are also people from France, Belgium, Spain, and, increasingly, Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, and the Black Sea and ski parks have traditionally had a large Russian customer base.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers either buy renovated properties for between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old houses that have been destroyed for between 5 and 15 thousand euros, and then they renovate them.
They need good accessibility and communication, they need a big city, businesses and, generally, the local doctor.
The second category is for holiday shoppers (Bulgaria was in the top 10 of German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business investors who buy in the hope of a medium or long-term increase in value.
The capital's real estate prices continue to rise as demand increases.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest property prices in the European Union, it has grown by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially outpacing the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percent
According to Minister of the Environment and Water Fodor Gábor, the meetings of experts will be concluded on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers will continue with the negotiation of the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the efforts needed to meet the emissions reduction target set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
This is a hot debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it is not willing to negotiate exact figures at this time, although it is willing to agree to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The other big question at the conference is whether developed countries will commit to reducing emissions and also to provide both material and technological assistance to countries in need.
Even aid to developing countries was agreed upon.
The aid fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected to be within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - see Market and Profit.
Hungary six per cent
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Water Fodor Gábor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate action and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU was committed to a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels, irrespective of the success of the 'post-2012 agreement', and was ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30 per cent if other large developed regions of the world and developing countries were willing to commit themselves to their responsibilities and capabilities.
The EU's new policy on climate change was based on a new approach to climate change, which was adopted by the Council in June.
Hungary's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87 is a commitment that our country will fulfill. - reminds the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, where a long-term international climate agreement must be reached within two years or its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012.In this case, the Kyoto Protocol reduction commitments would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction regime, as the IPCC, the UN's Nobel Peace Prize-winning international scientific body on climate change, has pointed out in its latest report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and make it inevitable that the average temperature of the Earth would rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
The videos of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are being shared on the video sharing platform by units of the British Army to promote themselves.
The British air force (RAF) has been the first to get on YouTube, with special forces in Afghanistan uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
These images, taken by a miniature helmet-mounted camera, are reviewed by the Air Force's operations command in Kandahar, then sent to London, where they're uploaded by the home front.
Political message is essential
Air Force personnel have had 139 videos uploaded to the Internet in this format, and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered it as 'defenceheadquarters' in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the UK Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Peacekeeping Force (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended to use the videos for recruitment purposes, and the Department of Defense believes that it's also a good way to educate the public about the true purpose of the military's overseas presence.
Such propaganda is relatively inexpensive compared with traditional television recruitment ads, said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but it inevitably carries a political message, justifying government military action in a unique way.
The Americans made a game
The army also has a problem with carefully edited, censored footage, and amateur videos that show the death of soldiers, for example: in the slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers talk about the losses, but do not show the bloody side of the battle.
Incidentally, there are already a number of videos on the Internet from the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan, taken from high-intensity operations, but the British military have only recently been able to discover this.
Americans are recruiting in a slightly different way, with the free downloadable shooter called America's Army, in which the player can directly assume the role of a soldier in a more or less lifelike simulation.
It's going to be a Christmas of kicking and screaming at the ministries.
Labour Minister Lamperth Monika is not showing any emotion, instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end job fair for her colleagues, who have been getting cake and coffee since 2007.
There are ministries where there is live music, and others where the bells and whistles are used to create a Christmas spirit in the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas, concerts and buffet - that's how power is fun.
The government agencies are getting ready for Christmas.
The largest departmental Christmas party this year is being held by the Department of Defense, but HM is not hosting departmental employees.
Orphans' Christmas is a time when children of fallen soldiers receive gifts, and Missionary Christmas is a time when families of soldiers currently serving overseas missions are entertained, but also a time when a press conference is held.
The purse is 25 million for the end-of-year fundraiser.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) are the ones who are the ones who are getting the boot.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total cost of 4,320,000 HUF, and about 350 guests are expected from the 600 employees of the Ministry.
The purse celebration will be all about the Christmas spirit, but there will be entertainers and raffle tickets.
The NFÜ Christmas party cost 4 700 000 forints and was held in the National Council of the Judiciary (OIT) building on Wednesday - concerts and dinner were included.
The hall cost one million forints, with the remainder being spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We know that one of the NFÜ's divisions is also involved in another Christmas celebration, which is being organised by a tendering company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
They rented the building of the Vígszínház for this purpose.
The information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt, as we were unable to reach the person in charge.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held a Luca Day ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
He didn't ask them for money for the use of the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's toast, and after dinner, there was live music to dance to.
In answer to your question about the origami, you were told that the prom was not mandatory for evening dress or suit.
The puritan economy is now dominated by the health, the labor and the municipal coffers.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a show and a celebration for the workers in their own building for 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister Lamperth Mónika, however, is not officially attending a Christmas party, but a year-end labour conference.
They're expecting 180 guests, who, according to the press office, will only be served coffee and bagels, so the party will cost 350,000 forints.
The Minister of Local Government Gordon from Bavaria will simply be having a drink with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is holding a Christmas rally in its main hall, with 436 employees expected to attend.
Each guest is given 2,500 forints for the Christmas party - a buffet and a brandy.
Since John Veres became Minister, every year the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas in the same way.
But there will be no party atmosphere, the formality is not only enhanced by the minister's speech, but also by the afternoon's schedule.
The Agricultural Fund will be hosting a New Year's Eve reception on January 20th, and the Ministry Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyadvár, in the Town Square, and according to the announcement of the wallet, for every hundred guests, 1,000 forints will be allocated.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple standing appointment, for which only foreign specialists accredited to Hungary are authorised.
These annual receptions begin with a brief ministerial reception and end with a low-key banquet.
There will be no Christmas party at all, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture have announced to the relevant press departments.
The price of the Environmental Fund's Christmas office was not disclosed at the press conference.
Each year, more than 400 people are invited to the party, which is held at the Museum of Fine Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
On Friday, the union federation and the National Union of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee to coordinate the Monday indefinite strike.
A protest rally is scheduled for Saturday, and the strike will begin on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health care bill.
The action will certainly cause significant disruption to transportation, as almost all rail traffic will be shut down and there will be a strike at the BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will announce the details of the Monday strike, organized in conjunction with the National Federation of Labour Councils.
There is also a strike committee called LIGA-MOSZ, which will coordinate the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest rally will be held, and from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will suspend work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike was not indicated on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
If the National Assembly fails to pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
If the bill is voted down, the strike committees will meet and decide whether to continue.
It's possible that the National Assembly will vote on the health insurance bill late in the evening, or at night, based on Monday's agenda.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, major disruptions in traffic can be expected: the railway will be closed for an indefinite period of time, and some of Budapest's public transport, more than half of the Volán companies, may be shut down in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a series of mid-level roadblocks in many parts of the country.
The call for a strike has been joined by many unions and civil society organizations, and the list is updated on the League website.
Some organizations have called for strikes for an indefinite period, while others have called for temporary work stoppages.
By Thursday afternoon, the MAV and the VDSZSZ had failed to agree on adequate service, even as the Christmas holidays approached and more people were traveling by train.
According to the previous announcements, there will be strikes at BKV from 7 am to 1 pm, at Budapest Airport from 7 am to 9 am, four-hour strike by the LIGA Electricity and Heating Industry Trade Unions, and two 2-8 hour work stoppages by the Pedagoges Trade Union and the Pedagoges Democratic Trade Union.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide at alternating times, while the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ) affiliated to SZEF is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The League's four demands, the most important of which is that the government withdraw its proposal for health care reform and allow a new concept for social debate.
The second demand is to introduce gradually the new pension calculation method due next year.
The third is to ensure that the benefits are available to those in jobs that are eligible for them before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) of the League of Trade Unions does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for the railway wings, it is waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has raised the risk of the country
The Hungarian Guard, which was founded in August of this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement for Hungary, has raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
The company's "risk warning" stated that the greatest political risk in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard was that "the ethnic tension that already exists between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary could be exacerbated by violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this all can be traced back to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: "the public debate on the Roma issue was left to representatives of radical and extreme political groups, who could build a political strategy against the Gypsy-Hungarian contrast".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, empowers extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflict, they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, under the influence of large domestic and international media attention, "significantly worsened the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in the country's stability and democratic development".
They remind us that since the autumn of 2006, as part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which has received increasing publicity and momentum, several organizations calling themselves "national self-defense" associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the readiness of their members - even armed - for defense (disaster protection, homeland defense, law enforcement) tasks, moreover citing the incompetence of the police, the army, that is, the state", they added.
They noted that this is in keeping with the way that, based on the politics and nonpartisanship of society, various political aspirations are put into the civil garment.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association is therefore not merely a means of avoiding the legal pitfalls of judicial registration for these associations, but also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a risk-increasing factor also in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been mentioned as a potential source of danger in several neighboring states, and some ultra-nationalist political actors in neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region", it added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in East-Central Europe, thus increasing political risks for the whole region.
As it was written, the Hungarian Guard's operation is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard was the mass Roma riots that broke out in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this to decide to establish the Guard, saying that the purpose of the organization was "national self-defense".
For the past 17 years, they say, there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained passive and indifferent, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they wrote, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they will create their own guards as a form of resistance.
As the Hungarian Guard's operations so far show similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threat by organizing their own self-defense, according to a risk warning by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, told the telegraph office that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, they publish their risk assessment every year, and if they see something that could affect the risk, they inform the public, like in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not all places have red letters
In Hungary, the law precisely marks the days in red letters, and around holidays it has become a general practice to change the working day, which will be less next year.
The EU and America do not have a unified holiday.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and public holidays and public holidays.
The holidays are usually associated with church holidays, or significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new one are both holidays - the latter just so that the new year's holidaymakers can rest.
We have eleven red letter holidays all year, by the way.
The 15th of March commemorating the 1848 Revolution and the 23rd of October, the day of remembrance of the 1956 Revolution, are also national holidays.
August 20th is the anniversary of the founding of the state, May 1st is the anniversary of work, and November 1st and 2nd are the anniversaries of our deceased relatives and friends.
We also have two-day festivals, Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to allocate working days in cases where we would only work one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we don't miss the work-school weekend.
The exact time when the day immediately preceding or following the holiday must be worked has been regulated by the Minister for Labour Affairs in a separate decree for many years.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, as well as public employees and those in public service.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions which operate without interruption and which, due to their purpose, also operate on non-working days.
This year, the only time the work schedule changes is around the end of the year holidays: from December 24 onwards, life in the country almost stops, since experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year's are "slipped" by the majority of people, or used for this purpose by the majority of people.
Next year, we'll have more holidays in the middle and end of the week, so we'll have fewer working days than we did this year.
First, the calendar is shifted around Labor Day, so that workers stay home for four days in a row.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a workday, in exchange for Friday, May 2nd, a day off.
The second shift is related to the holiday on October 23: on October 18, you will have to work on Saturday instead of Friday the 24th.
However, the end of the year may be filled with celebration for the coming year, since almost everywhere, even on New Year's Day, December 24 is a nonstop holiday.
Six deterrents to annoy your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never get, innocent lies that we barely notice: these color our workplace.
The question is whether you'll get used to the little inconveniences or put on gloves and consciously avoid the misunderstood situations that cause annoyance to others.
I'm going to tip.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were being asked about the marketing department", says one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting because of this?
At best, you'll feel sorry and try to make it up to them, or you'll call marketing and tell them you forgot to pass the message (the less common approach).
Most of the time, an apology is a done deal.
Before making any embarrassing apologies, it is wise to consider what you can do to make your coworkers feel uncomfortable, and consciously try to avoid doing so.
Borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a file, or a file, or your phone, and it's not there.
Remember when you left your stapler on the table last night and it was gone by morning?
Maybe you'll discover on one of your colleagues' desks your supposedly lost pen?
Don't take anything from your coworkers without asking, because they'll be right to be angry at you for trespassing on their property.
Don't pocket office envelopes, mail-it, because it can be uncomfortable if they run out before your time, and you need it right away.
You gossip about the privacy of your colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already been spreading.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Do not impose your assumptions about the private lives of your colleagues on everyone else.
If one of them shares their deepest secrets with you, don't betray their trust.
Bury the past in your head and don't negotiate with your co-workers in your absence, even if others know about your co-worker's past.
You're calling in sick without a warrant?
When you call the office and report sick because you have a crappy headache or because you feel like you should be resting that day, remember that your work, your urgent tasks, your deadlines, must be done by someone else.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you will not be in the office the next day or that something may happen that will require you to stay at home, signal that your colleagues and your boss will not be in the office the next day.
♪ I'm all about the cuddling, the wailing, the phoning ♪
You're so immersed in your work, you're getting dragged out by the laughter of your coworkers?
Did you unwittingly witness a phone conversation that you would rather not have heard?
Do not disturb your coworkers by shouting, singing, talking loudly (which you do over their heads), or by kicking, swearing, or loudly complaining.
All of these can be confusing, even if they don't go into a project (writing, design, organization).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If you don't have something on time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don't blame anyone else for your forgetfulness!
Don't invoke the chaos that may be in the office, your noisy colleagues.
Admit when you've made a mistake that has cost someone else, and then wipe the slate clean.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake, make up for the time you missed.
Feeling too at home in the office?
Panties and slippers are comfortable to wear at home, but not at the office.
Don't wear comfortable casual clothes when your job allows it.
Stop being a slut, your colleagues, and honor yourself by wearing your regular clothes - if your job requires it, nice and elegant - when you go into the office.
If you want to answer me, you're not interesting anymore
A car chase in the usual morning traffic.
The radio is accompanied by a special sound, a violin sound, and electronic effects.
I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit.
The music changes its tempo and the bass comes along with the previous phrases, then a female chorus joins as a real gem.
"Zagar Wings of Love" is playing on mr2.
For a long time, the country's musical life has spoiled us with a good selection of electronic pop.
But now it seems like the traffic is different when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
The emergence of Yonderboi, some new and exciting productions coming from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture, and although guitar-flapping garage rock is in fashion again, the domestic electropop is also proving: there is something new under the sun.
Zságer Balázs was from Pécs, and he played in the band of Yonderboi, until - perhaps because two horns couldn't fit in a flock - he started his own path.
His project (Zagar) and his music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, however, began to break through when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The Commission has therefore decided to extend the scope of the measure.
The band, which at first played in small clubs, became known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine listed their first album in 2002 as one of the fifty most important Hungarian albums, and Zagar, in the company of Yonderboi, was named the only Hungarian trendsetter who seemed to be able to market in the West.
No doubt, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but of course, no one asked them if they liked wearing the label.
The band reacted the way they should have: they made a new, better record.
The new album Cannot Walk Fly Instead is a new direction for them, although the title itself is intended to create a continuity with the initial years of the band.
This was a line from a Zságer Balázs old band.
The airy, airy reference would be appropriate, but the airiness of the music is now accompanied by the more loud guitar, the rock and roll influence, in keeping with the spirit of the times.
In these songs, György Ligeti, who is currently working with the band The Puzzle in England, showed himself at the Millennium premiere of the album.
The album also produced a real radio hit, mr2 Petőfi, who recently played popular music from morning to night, began to smuggle the big-hearted songs of Wings of Love recorded with the Hungarian singer ("Underground Divas") into his ears.
So everything is all right.
This is from the hg.hu Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: With this new hit song, it begs the question: how much of the layer is left in the music you're playing?
The definition of layered doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music cassettes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can be flat, meaningless, and just as ready to sell, which makes it commercialized.
But a good pop song can also be born of sincere motivation.
The host attitude also operates in this spirit, regardless of language or national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
ZsB: Abroad, especially in the West, there are larger traditions of light music.
Not only do people between the ages of 10 and 20 go to concerts there, but older ones do too.
They are much more aware of the changes in the light music around them, because they see it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, or how many listen to your music?
ZB: Of course, it's nice to see more people coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The audience's role is more evident in the concert, where the interaction is already there, but it's just the intangible changes of the moment.
But I've noticed that if you want to please the audience, you're not interesting anymore.
How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a solo artist, and he's built his career west of us.
ZB: We're not really on his path, despite the fact that sometimes they try to explain that into our music.
We're more like team players, who trust the other person's music and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work would be compared to Yonderboy's music, as several of us had left his band and gone down a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love is at number one on the mr2 Petőfi list.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open yourself up to a wider audience with the more popular styles?
ZB: We had no plans to write a hit song and then sell the record.
This song is about more than that.
We did it for the album finale, trying to undo the sound of the album and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them? What was the principle?
ZB: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
And that's when we came up with the idea of having this choir of our own, of the fine vocalists of our own country's music scene.
So we formed a six-member choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - which we later named the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this the way you designed the song or did the girls make it?
ZsB: The song had been around for a long time in an instrumental version, and when the record was put together, we thought we needed something more for this song.
The chord pattern was designed to be accompanied by a hymn.
That night, I sang the tune that the girls learned later.
It was almost instantaneous and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember he was very excited at the time, but of course, we had to have the Fairies.
My voice wouldn't have worked so powerfully.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They have no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role, they sing completely together and they're not louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
ZB: The reason they were behind was purely technical problems.
But you know we didn't want to share the solo parts.
And that's what the song is about, is to forget a little bit about our egos, about where we came from, where we're going, and just let those certain wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you work with the most?
ZsB: In the process of creating music, there were no really difficult pieces, but rather the mixing.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I'm playing on a racing piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't work for a long time, and then it all came together, like a puzzle game.
What's your favorite song from the new album?
ZB: It's always changing with the touring and the release of the album.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The rogue broker risked billions because of his inferiority complex.
He's a crooked loan shark.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French banker Société Générale, calls his former employee, Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that the not at all talentless Kerviel was more of a big player trying to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"Low mental capacity", said his superiors, who notified the police.
However, as reported in the French newspaper Le Monde, Kerviel's testimony shows that he made a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his businesses at the end of last year.
The disease is not limited to America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank", he says.
In the summer of the American crisis, he managed to earn half a billion euros.
You sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were reports of problems with so-called subprime mortgages for low-income or past-debt clients.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet on it.
Profits at the end of the year reached 1.6 billion euros.
"When I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to report it", admits Kerviel, adding that he didn't keep anything for himself.
In his confession, he admits that he falsified his reports so that they wouldn't be revealed.
He managed to con his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange was beginning to look into his dealings.
The risk was the gain
Was he afraid that it would be revealed?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would put them at ease".
Where did he get the guts to take that risk?
He's reached his position gradually.
After the fall of the University of Lyon, he worked at Société Générale Bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker's assistant, and in 2005, he became a self-employed broker, earning $90,000 a year.
Yet, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, I knew from the first conversation that I was being looked at the wrong way.
"I'm also grateful for my education, my professional and personal development", Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after he joined, he had his first big success.
He was earning from his Allianz shares, because he had put half a billion euros in the stock market during the London bombings.
And that started a whole avalanche of wanting more.
While you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snow globe", he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know everything, or guessed it.
"While I was making money, they were making shit".
But there was a blow earlier this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in the middle of January, he tried to steal it.
When he started work on Monday, he wasn't working at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
His freedom has made him suspicious.
"I only took four days off last year.
A broker who is not free is a broker who does not want anyone to see his reports", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Czech government ministers and European Commission representatives signed nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic will receive EUR 14 billion (around Kč) over the coming years.
This is roughly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic could obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will receive approximately 125 billion kroner from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will receive around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, goes to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
This money will increase the state's Transportation Infrastructure Fund, which will be managing 90.8 billion kronor next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to gain access to funds for innovation enterprises.
Companies should be able to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful of the newly joined countries in obtaining EU funds to date.
Nicaraguan ex-president's 20-year sentence upheld by court
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for former president Arnold Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 of committing $100 million in financial fraud.
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of the Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will be back in prison is unclear, according to the AP news agency.
The president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, says it will be up to the prison authorities to decide whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court found evidence that Alemán had been regularly transferring government funds to accounts in foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers were in reality owned by his relatives and his closest supporters.
Some of that money ended up in a foundation that Alemán set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
They left our budget intact.
That's right.
They've passed the state budget.
What's so special about this budget?
This is the first budget this government has put together, passed by a coalition majority, without opposition support.
This year, it was passed with the support of the Social Democrats, because Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the loud debate about the lack of confidence in the government before the vote, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives passed this largely ignored, though most influential, piece of legislation.
It's a bit of a paradox.
Every government begins and ends with a budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it's hidden behind the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
It's more appreciated in the press, so it gets a lot more media attention.
The public is much more interested in the debates of politicians than in the numbers.
The state budgets of past Social Democratic governments were suffering from three deficiencies that the 2008 budget cannot solve all at once:
The first of these is the high percentage of mandatory so-called "sponsor spending" law, which not only covers pensions but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM before the elections.
The second is the deficit management as a consequence of the first deficiency.
The third barrier is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of the municipalities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
It's public and relatively controlled.
Timebombs are a deficit in the budgets of cities and counties.
Many mayors, who could get money for other investments besides money from taxes, fees and bank loans, often issued bonds that unwisely put their town halls into disproportionate debt.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by selling off shares in the energy and other distribution networks that they received from the state from the privatisations.
They don't have that kind of source anymore.
Based on the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for a few years now, like the rest of the world, which the Czech Social Democratic Party constantly boasts about.
This was a unique opportunity for his government to put public finances in order.
Instead, the country was plunged deeper into debt.
The other countries, with a couple of exceptions like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, farmed much more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is a huge embarrassment to the previous governments.
We are one of the countries that is least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
So there is no need for, for example, huge social programmes which have unfortunately grown to gigantic proportions in the last few years, completely unnecessarily.
Even if we can eliminate some of the senseless populist spending that was approved before the election this year, even if we don't have a retirement age cap and pension reform in the near future, then this country will actually end any politics, and whoever governs it will be bureaucratic.
It is a bit of an exaggeration to say that most of the money taxed by the politicians in power is usually used for pensions and social benefits.
This year's budget cannot therefore be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by the proxy expenditure.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous administrations hadn't squandered everything that could have been made possible in the last decade.
If we do not want to see the ruling politicians become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this weak coalition government a break to prepare further reform legislation, knowing that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and fees.
Only these will allow a gradual achievement of a balanced budget.
The President of the Republic of Moldova
The banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland, and Canada have all agreed to join forces to fight the financial crisis.
The money markets are now over $100 billion in value through the stock market.
In this market, banks raise the interest rates they're willing to borrow money for.
For example, the US Fed is putting $40 billion on the stock exchange, and another $24 billion on the books for the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, the national central banks have agreed on a coordinated approach to preventing or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move should solve the economy's biggest problem, namely the growing shortage of free capital that banks can lend", Bernard Baumohl, of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a report to his clients.
"The coordinated action of central banks in the United States has reduced the probability of recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks, primarily in the United States, have lost $60 billion in unpaid loans.
Analysts are expecting billions more in losses.
"Central banks may indeed be afraid of what might follow if they decided to go this route", said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems to be a really bad situation", he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce demand and push the US economy into recession with potential consequences for the growth of the world economy.
The central banks have done so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, which is used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain also cut their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"This will have an effect similar to the further interest rate cut", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank's move will help to avert the crisis, as it will not solve the underlying problem, the collapse of the US housing market.
The incredible controversy of the ecologists
Global climate change is most threatening to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN's international conference on climate change in Bali.
His book Blue, not the Green Planet, presented in Vienna, made it clear that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
Klaus believes that not only the structure of the conference, which is an unusual mix of government and civil society representatives, is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality.
"The discussion there is completely without structure, it is just a throwing of words, which are substitutes for the solution of the current problems", Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he emphasised that his topic was very important to him, which is why he is so committed to this topic.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book was published in a German translation, since, as he said, "I often only come across caricatures of my opinion".
So now, all those interested can read his unvarnished opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he was not a climatologist, he felt he had sufficient background to write such a book.
As a professional conference monitor and judge, he has experience as an academic in statistics and economics.
The book concludes with the thesis that climate change is a constant, that it is normal, and that there is no consensus among scientists on the issue of global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious, and therefore not dangerous, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective, and unacceptably costly.
Furthermore, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, he considers the imposition of unproven opinions on others unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to those in attendance that he was "not against the reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
A similar topic was discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 couldn't get their license exchanged.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and couldn't get their old licenses replaced in time, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to request a replacement so that the agencies can issue the new driver's license by the end of the year.
But the Ministry is not afraid that after the new year, 100,000 drivers will be driving without a valid license.
The agencies say that the people who haven't changed their licenses are the ones who don't want to drive anymore.
As the traffic reports a sharp decline in interest in driver's license exchanges, the capital's offices have been flooded with applications for driver's license exchanges, which have seen a surge in interest this week.
The Mayor's office receives about 2,000 clients a day.
You'll have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, there are about 140000 drivers who have not yet changed their driving licence.
It takes 20 days to get a new driver's license.
However, the new driving licence can also be applied for within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete the mandatory license exchange by the end of the year and start with an invalid license will be fined from January.
The guilty party must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may settle the matter by agreement.
The fine for administrative negligence is 2500 crowns.
According to the information that the city has received, you can also be fined if you don't go anywhere.
He's supposed to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called on the agencies to be lenient and to impose fines of up to 1,000 kroner.
According to the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka, however, no one is threatened by fines of tens of thousands.
He thinks a driver's license is a document that people can use to decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card, which should be valid for everyone.
Those who no longer want to drive should give up their license.
Just take it or have it sent to the appropriate office.
By the end of the year, all licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers will also have to gradually replace other types of driving licences.
Those with documents from 1994-2000 can still exchange them for three years.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expire only in December 2013.
Hanzelka says there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court has reduced the sentences of the detectives who worked with Berdych.
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařik, former police officers, who are suspected of colluding with David Berdych, have been sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was the final decision of the Supreme Court of Prague, which reduced the sentences of one of them by one year and the other by two.
The investigators of the Prague Organized Crime Division were originally facing 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today's decision is final, and can only be appealed to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also a suspect in this case, he's only awaiting trial in the first degree.
In other cases, he has been sentenced to a total of more than 16 years.
That's all you get.
The County Court found 19 people guilty in January of participating in robberies, of which the Supreme Court heard 16 appeals today.
Most of the defendants have denied the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying they were speculative.
According to the Central Czech Senate, after the agreement with Berdytsch, the police members provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped the gang avoid criminal liability.
So the gang gave 30% of the loot to Opava and Koňařek.
The indictment covers the gang's crimes from 1999 to 2001.
These include robberies that often result in serious physical harm to the victim, but also misuse of public office and the illegal possession of firearms.
Because the police found illegal handguns, steel-core bullets, laser sights or machine guns during house searches.
The gang is accused of taking tens of millions of crowns with the robbers.
The gang of twenty-something has already been found by the courts in this proceeding legally guilty of other robberies by Berdych and many others.
Other members of Berdych's entourage are testifying before the court in other proceedings, some of which have not yet gone to trial.
Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, have so far avoided trial, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for criminal proceedings.
Bill for the exchange of children: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged families, Igor Veleba, demands from the hospital in Třebíč 12 million crowns in compensation plus court costs.
Three million for the mothers, two million for the fathers, and one million for the children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per birth.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál Veleba, disagrees with the proposal.
"We reject such a claim because it is too much", Dostál said after today's hearing.
"To form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion prepared by the counter-proposal.
We're determining if it has any use value.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone", Dostál stressed.
He thinks the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablons wanted a million crowns for every month until she raised their biological daughter.
Veleba was the subject of an expert review prepared by the Motol University Hospital in Prague, which served as the basis for the compensation negotiations.
The children's parents suffered from varying degrees and depths of emotional damage and stress, according to psychologists and psychiatrists.
Men were better at handling stress, even when faced with the criticism that they didn't interfere with the newborn's exchange.
Women are less able to deal with the actuality of trauma and what's happening right now, summarized in Vele.
Veronika and Nikola were switched at the Třebíč maternity hospital on December 9th.
Last week the children were returned to their parents by birth - Nikola and Čermák in Prybyslavica, Veronika and Libor in Brno and Jaroslava in Jablonec.
At the end of October, the district head of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 crowns to the families to compensate for their expenses, which were caused by the mistake of the hospital in Trbičské, which is run by the district.
All Czech hospitals are covered by compulsory insurance.
In case of error, they have to reach for the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases, they can ask the founder for help.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low compensation to people, the amounts being calculated on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million kroner.
Polívka lost his kingdom of Valašsko
Polívka Bolek lost the case for the title of the Kingdom of Vlassko.
According to the judge of the District Court of Ostrava, although he was the first to use the title of Valachi King, the project was developed by the team of Tomáš Harabiš and his team, who worked with the actor for many years.
Polívka was not present at the hearing today.
However, according to his legal counsel, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are feeding off the popularity of Bolek Polívka", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
He says that when you hear the words "Kingdom of Valachi", you think of an actor-comedian.
This is the opinion of Harabiš.
"We've had almost ten years of work behind us.
"Finding money and making stocks", he said.
He thinks the money's the reason for the fight.
"Years later, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They want to profit from our work", he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, the name King Polívka was first used by the Vlachs in a TV program.
In 1993, he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohaty.
But at the time, it was not connected with the goal of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing passports to the Valachi.
The original student-sponsored action turned into a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabiš later founded the creation of the Valašsko Kingdom Society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to put her name and signature on the passports, and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting her farm and theater performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš himself was only using the idea that Polívka had put out in the manse for his business.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity has certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project", the judge said.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was the intensive work of Harabiš and his team.
The cooperation of the now-conflicted parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabís have accumulated, culminating in the acquittal of "the eternally elected King Boleslav I".
The leading role in the kingdom was taken over by Jarmila Šulaáková as the queen mother on the initiative of Harabiš.
In 2002, she filed a lawsuit against Polívka Harabiš and Co. which was rejected by the court today.
The battle planned by Harabis could bring light to the controversy for the throne and the princess's half.
This fight should make him a new king.
He didn't want to give details or a date.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
This should be something like the Slovak royal exodus.
A king should be elected for a fixed term.
Mr. Polívka is also welcome to apply", added Mr. Harabiš.
The 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: the prejudices are fading
To be honest, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The quality of the shift, the driving and the production are often below average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, is already on the market and is much better.
And the SW-called station wagon is one step further, so I'm left with no choice but to think it over.
When I was testing the Peugeot 207 classic hatchback, for example, I complained about the back seat being left in the front.
This time the complaining is over, as the body of the estate means that the two-meter giants are no longer suffering in this respect.
♪ On the run ♪
I'll get through the courtyard quickly so I don't have to repeat myself so many times.
It's a fairly well-designed console, and my only complaint is that it's a poor console.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invention here, if the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom or the beaks.
The side-drive was also improved compared to the 206.
As for the cargo, you can also see the increase in the dimensions of the body.
The little head space that I mentioned before disappears in the station wagon.
Bags in the trunk.
The most important thing in this vehicle is the cargo area.
I would consider it to be very accessible (also thanks to the retractable rear window) and to be spacious.
The empty spaces are equipped with storage racks, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they're stretchable and they can carry heavier objects.
But let's stick to the volume for a little bit.
This is based on the tables, the basic layout is 428 l, which is more average compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most sought-after car in this class - compared to the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the younger Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is noticeably behind the 52 liters.
For a foreign holiday or a stroller placement, this value is almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I would have to mention the almost perfectly straight floor after the second row of backrests had been lowered or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was powered by a four-cylinder, 1.6-liter, 88-horsepower, inline-six engine.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 1600 that drives a family hatchback should look like.
It's quiet, low-powered and primarily pulls.
Compared to the Škoda's counterpart, which often looks like a rags-on-the-mouth exhaust, I can only be happy with that.
The river is flowing
The price of the motorcar is not cheap.
But we must remember that we tested a car with a large interior and a very good engine.
The car with the four-cylinder engine of foreigners for 329 900 Kč still goes.
The car starts at 410,990 horsepower, which is quite a lot.
The Premium equipment we tested will add an additional 80,000 Kč to the equipment.
But we also had head-sacs, automatic air conditioning, automatic window wipers, rear windows, electric remote controls...
So the car with the hood and the hatchback costs 531,900 Kč.
That's a lot, but add in the additional equipment on the Fabia, and you get a very similar result.
So all we have to do is decide on the brand.
Failure to integrate Slovak students into British schools
There is a growing number of Eastern European children in British schools, which raises concerns amongst locals about the future of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already reported cases where arguments between immigrant and native-born children have turned violent.
The problems of integrating Eastern European children are illustrated by an incident in northern Kent, where disputes between the settlers and Slovak immigrants are escalating.
The students' quarrels and arguments are already characteristic of the parents' relations.
The situation escalated to the point that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman for beating a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The defendant claims that the boy insulted her with racist slurs.
Police had to act after two 12-year-old girls were attacked by Slovaks on immigrant.
The girls allegedly used racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"On our way home, a boy climbed onto the bus and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he came at us with apples and beads and then exposed his naked buttocks", the mother of the Slovak students wrote in a recent article for The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described the controversy over Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks looking for work in the UK.
There are about 30,000 Slovak students in British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you want from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you choose well.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or the sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters serving pizza, ice cream or boozy cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find it in a complete and even richer inventory.
But there is much more to be found on one island, Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was a bastion of American conquest.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse of treasure and a transshipment point for goods that were looted by the Spaniards in the Americas and shipped to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the late '20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, built it because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (primarily prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and promoted drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
I've been to the movies.
Havana was built with tower houses and wide avenues lined with cars, which became a cult symbol in the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of American showbusiness stars and politicians.
What about today?
You can paint the walls of Bodeguita in Havana with your handwriting.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, they'll mix you a cocktail of your choice.
And the cult cars of the '50s are still on the road in Havana today, as the once exported cigars and youths have long since rotted in this salty and moist air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has been largely destroyed, there are no other colonial monuments in the area as beautiful as this one.
Other places are getting better, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides much-needed money, development has been given the green light.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, and others.
Cuba offers another unique delicacy that is especially appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugarcane was transported to the sugar mills by steam and motor trains.
Their motor fleet has not been updated for decades, so they display machines that are still in operation, machines that are only seen in museums.
Where are we going?
Most visitors to Cuba do not avoid the most famous places.
So there's not much to write about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should remind you that the aforementioned Hemingway estate is a museum, and if you love the writer, you should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Viňales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba, in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from lime.
The valley floor is steeped in limestone formations, limestone tops, and rocks, and their cavities are covered with fertile soil that makes the scattered ridges densely vegetated.
The valley is where some of the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be seen when you visit a cigar factory in Havana.
Some of you might find it interesting that it was the location of Major Zeman's Chilean episode.
The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy is embodied in the beauty and monumentality of the not-so-large city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, which was greatly influenced by later French settlers, remained almost unchanged for four centuries.
The plain of Escambray, between the sea and Trinidad, is so isolated that even in the 1950's, there were no roads connecting it to the rest of the country.
That kind of isolation helped him stay an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't tear it down, and everybody was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon to spend in Trinidad, it is worth visiting such local attractions as Playa Ancón and the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
And in the evening, it's a good idea to go to the Casa de la Música, which is awakened after dark, where the music only subsides in the morning.
Other, including mixtures
The town of Cuba, in the eastern part of the country, is considered by some to be the most beautiful town.
Surely, the road itself has influenced that opinion.
Both routes from Guantanamo to the island have to cross high, jagged mountains, and pass through nature that is hardly touched by human activity.
The eastern landscape of Cuba has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its pristine nature.
It is where the best chocolate is made, the church has a Columbus cross (actually made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and from the hill where the castle once stood and today stands the El Castillo hotel, you can see some table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Much can be written about coffee, rum, cigars, the plains of the Sierra Meastro, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Caridad del Cobra, the patron saint of Cuba, and Santeria, the African religion practiced by descendants of former slaves.
I mean, as they say, "better seen than heard".
Afghan allies are passive, say the Americans
The lack of troops and equipment is also affecting the progress of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should outline specific plans for the coming years.
The Afghanistan mission is not going as planned, agreed to in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the leaders of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country.
In the face of growing Taliban resistance, the eight participating countries are also discussing further planning and coordination of the allies.
While the US Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, has called for greater activity by NATO troops this week, Britain has made strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development aid a priority.
"The progress in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to take the lead in further developing the economy and security", British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is at its highest level in five years, according to U.S. government data.
Violent crime increased by 27 percent in the last year, and in the southern province of Helmand, by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern areas.
But the United States believes that the Allies have reached their limits in terms of troop organization and equipment.
In particular, they requested additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think hard about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them", Gates said.
In a similar spirit, today, Jaap de Hoop, the Secretary General of NATO, spoke.
"I'm not happy with what's happening in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been debate among the participating countries in recent months over whether all allies are providing the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are present in Afghanistan in relatively large numbers.
But they've been planted in areas where the least violence and fighting is required, so they're not as high as we are in the southern and eastern parts of the country", Gates said.
The Sun, a British tabloid, this week called the German soldiers "lazy".
"Afghan journalists exposed: Germans playing while our boys are fighting", the Sun wrote in a piece accompanied by a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded by publishing a photo of a British team playing soccer in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will reach one billion dollars in 2009
Each Czech is owed 84,000 crowns.
The total debt stood at 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, by early December, the Ministry had reduced this plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt stood at 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, it decreased by 13,4 billion kroner from June.
The Treasury has today confirmed its public debt figures for the beginning of October.
Each Czech is owed more than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state was over $11 billion in debt.
"For the time being, it seems that, with a smaller deficit next year, we will only be able to cross the one trillion mark in 2009.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and one trillion crowns", said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, to iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikora said: "We could cross the one trillion mark in the course of 2009.
Exactly when depends on the next budget, which is still unknown.
If it turns out that the political landscape is changing, that politicians are willing to save more, that could be postponed until 2010.
But I don't expect that change", he said.
Growing debts
The government debt is the central government debt, which is mainly formed by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The public debt is financed by banknotes, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has risen to SEK 719,4 billion by 38.5 billion so far this year.
The state's foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable government debt reached NOK 803,3 billion at the end of September and decreased by NOK 13,7 billion from June.
The average maturity of the sovereign debt has increased to 6.5 years.
"The total public debt for the year has increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is really quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is generated primarily by bonds, which are up 20 percent.
The bad thing is that the debt is increasing, but on the other hand it shows how we will have to trade when the pension reform comes", Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of the public debt for 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159,2 billion kroner this year.
However, by early December, the ministry had reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily a deficit in the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the assumed 91,3 billion crowns.
Furthermore, it concerns the planned maximum resource of CZK 13,3 billion from the Czech Consolidation Agency, a reserve of CZK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of CZK 43 billion of government bonds and the repayment of CZK 1,8 billion of loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher will appear today in a Khartoum court for a name given to a stuffed animal.
A Khartoum court sentenced a British teacher to 15 days in jail and deportation from the country on Thursday night for violating Islam in Sudan, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six- to seven-year-old pupils to name a teddy bear after Muhammad, but Islam forbids any depiction of the prophet.
Such an act is punishable by lashing.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum was arrested at her home on Sunday, charged with insulting Islam and rebellion under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after parents of the students had lodged several complaints with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her six- and seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"The children suggested a total of eight names, including Hasan, Abdullah, and Mohammed", says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, 20 of the 23 children voted for the name Mohammed.
Muhammad is, of course, the name of the prophet of Islam, but it's also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with the photo of the macaw and the inscription "My name is Mohamed".
The problem is that any depiction of the Prophet is a violation of Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague who teaches at the same school, said that she knows her well and that she would never have done anything that violated any religious belief, saying that it was "an innocent mistake", "just sorry that she voted with the kids".
Many of her students agree with this view, saying that she "treats the children very well" and "never discusses religion in class".
Remember, Muhammad is also the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This is one of the first names Muslim families have chosen so often to express their respect for the prophet (often given to the firstborn of the family).
But what are the rules for using a first name?
Can a toy be called that?
That's obviously a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached at the last talks in Vienna on Wednesday on the future status of the province.
The end result is failure.
The sixth and final round of talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the breakaway province ended without any agreement Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not reached an agreement on status", EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
US Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the talks.
"There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but there will be a very difficult period", he added, stressing the "existence of obvious tensions".
The mediation ends on 10 December
The EU, the US and Russia will make their final trilateral visits to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province of 90 percent Albanian Lakhta may be clear after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harchenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10th.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, was the sixth and final meeting of the talks since the UN entrusted the troika with a new mediation mission last August.
The Americans and the Europeans consider their mediation task to be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already defeated the cause of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after the deadline.
"Russia was committed and will remain committed to a negotiated solution, to compromise", Bocan-Harchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN control over Kosovo, Western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina has said that she is ready to make a unilateral statement if the Security Council does not decide in her favour.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement", announced the president of the independent province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where "the last chance negotiations" have been going on since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising and future Prime Minister of the province, also expressed his condolences.
But he added that Belgrade's vision of autonomy would be "a continuation of a past that has been marked by murders and deportations".
The domino effect.
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, said that a compromise was still possible and warned Kosovo's Albanian majority of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino effect" because of the wars of independence in the 1990s in a region still unstable.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise", Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be left solely to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
"The parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", declared the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations lasted two years.
They must end where they began: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the last word", adding that the unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians is based on "agreements" with Western powers.
Bush is pushing for reconciliation between Israel and Palestine.
President George Bush announced Tuesday at the opening of an international peace conference he hosted in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin talks immediately to settle their 60-year-old dispute.
Bush, in the presence of the two presidents, promised to support them in every way possible to sign the "peace agreement" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle 'terrorist networks' and Israel must end its colonial activities, Mr Bush said, and reminded both sides of their commitments under the 'peace agenda' adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the goal of the Abbas-led negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel is "to sign a peace treaty that will resolve all outstanding issues, including the core issues".
The latter concerns three delicate issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict who lived in the territory of the modern state of Israel.
Abbas, speaking for the US president, insisted that future negotiations be "global and profound" and cover all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, the refugee issue, borders, colonies, water and security".
Then, as he stepped up, Olmert promised that future negotiations would be "direct and continuous", and he would seek to have them "completed in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush had set out the vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, living side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had been promised this by Bush before he decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was considered a success by Washington) has initiated a plan with the support of all Arab countries that guarantees Israel peace in exchange for withdrawing from all Arab territories captured during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is a gateway to the history of the Middle East, especially because it takes the problem at its root and focuses on the central issues", the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
The prosecutor says the officers are not liable.
What happened on Sunday, exactly?
As is usually the case with news of this nature, the official position and the rumours contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the initial data of the investigation launched by the Inspector General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 5 p.m.
"The car was on patrol, so it was not involved in any action. It was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without any sirens", a police source told us.
The two youths without helmets were driving "at high speed" on a green Kawasaki engine "not registered and therefore not roadworthy" (see below).
"Because the right-hand rule was not observed, the engine hit the left side of the police car", says one officer.
The passengers in the vehicle tested negative for alcohol.
The force of the impact is indicated by the fact that the front of the car was crushed, the windshield cracked in a star shape, and the bumper was broken.
The Pontoise prosecutor, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced in an emergency announcement yesterday morning that she had instructed the IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate to investigate the case, which was "due to a reckless homicide and failure to provide assistance".
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that the IGPN investigation is at a stage where the police can be excluded from responsibility.
The prosecutor said that three witnesses to the accident, interviewed Sunday night, confirmed "the police's account that the scooter came in relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, a line, no doubt pulled by footrests on the side of the road, showed that the two vehicles collided and drove together for a while until the police car was able to fall over.
The vehicles were seized for technical examination.
The bodies of the two victims were examined yesterday by the medical examiner.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, a rumor spread in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had left the scene without giving any help to the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN is cautious, but it does not rule out that the police officers committed "any serious error".
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased caution in the process", a police source told us.
Libération interviewed a witness who reported the incident a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows in his apartment looks right into the crime scene.
"My cousin and I, who is a hospital nurse, immediately went down to try to resuscitate them", the witness relates.
"There was nothing we could do".
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and grimaced.
The other two tried to resuscitate one of the youths, and the fourth made a phone call".
Tensions grew as the desperate plight of the two young men became clear, and the police officers who were on their way out drove their colleagues away.
We also know from the witness's statement that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They used a heart massage, but it didn't work.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help the young people.
The young ones did receive help.
Firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first protests since General Musarraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern city of Lahore, approximately 2,000 lawyers protesting against the emergency measures were injured by tear gas used by the security forces.
They responded by throwing stones at the police, injuring several of them.
They produced at least 350 lawyers.
Similar incidents have occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers have attacked and injured lawyers.
They've produced multiple individuals.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court registered lawyers called for a general strike and protested the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the gathering.
There were also protests in Multan in the central part of the country and in Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movement has also been supported by the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties, whose leader "has urged the people to send flowers to the judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who have sworn allegiance to Musarraf".
"Mussaraf's promise is no longer in force"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the extraordinary measure announced Saturday night.
The Court is due to rule in the coming days on the legality of President Musarraf's re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and replaced.
"What we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's decisions", the president told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise to leave the military to assume the civilian presidency has "lost its validity" after the imposition of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Musarraf was to have his military uniform removed by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has also denied a rumor that has been spreading around the country that President Musarraf has been forced to appoint a deputy general.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unintended pregnancies (24%), and those that are not planned or not planned at all.
Even today, more than one-third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by France's National Institute of Demography (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law was passed liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unintended pregnancies (24%), and those that are not planned or not planned at all.
Ined estimates that various methods of contraception, such as the pill or the IUD, still fail in 5 to 6 percent of cases.
However, according to the institute, liberalization of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that in 1970, only 5 percent of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took the birth control pill, but that rate has increased to 60 percent.
Today, eight out of 10 pregnancies are considered planned.
Every five months, he plans to have a baby, and if possible, in the spring, since that is the best time of year to have a baby.
A spectacular repair to the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the International Space Station crew spent more than seven hours in space to perform a spectacular repair of a ruptured solar panel, essential to the station's scientific activities.
This dangerous spacewalk was a record in many ways: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to plan it, and it had to be done away from the living modules, with tools "forged" by the astronauts.
The problem emerged on Tuesday when the astronauts disconnected the Harmony module from Discovery, a giant cylindrical structure that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to the laboratory modules.
However, they must be provided with power.
The crew's second task was to relocate the 17.5-ton solar panels to one of the power-generating modules already on the ISS.
The crew then began to open the module's 250-foot-wide solar panels.
One of the harmonically folded boards was then broken by a cable about three feet [1 m] long.
To avoid further damage, the tablet was not opened further.
The astronauts' original task was to take a walk on the Discovery spacecraft and then repair another faulty rotating solar panel, but instead they had to devote their time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to do the feat by hanging on the space shuttle's 100-foot robotic arm, which is attached to the station's crank.
He is one of NASA's top spacewalkers.
He's tall, strong, extremely agile, muscular upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old doctor had to "operate" on the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully measuring the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with some "shades".
He was assisted by another "spacewalker" who stayed close to the safe passageway, and from inside by the other astronauts, including the crew captain, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, insulated against the hundreds of volts of voltage from the solar panels, was invented and "co-engineered" by the station's astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his teammates had fully opened the board, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had a half-day rest, and today, seven have returned to the shuttle Discovery to begin their scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
Decline in the exchange rate of EADS shares
EADS shares fell sharply on the Paris stock exchange after the aircraft and defence equipment company announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently EUR 21,96 after a decrease of 4%.
The company was forced to revise its forecasts for operating profit in 2007 because the development of the A400M engine was delayed, which would have delayed the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the combat transport aircraft, announced in October, 'will cost between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion will be for Airbus', announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these expenses, EADS will have to report new projected figures for its 2007 operating profit next Thursday when it reports its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide further figures.
The group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS' operating profit fell by 86% due largely to the delay in the development of another programme, the A380 giant plane, which also imposed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to deliver the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The status quo is maintained.
The election on Sunday is not expected to be a big surprise: The vast majority of Russians will vote for President Putin's party, United Russia.
This is the Russian's desire for stability, for what could be called arbitrary rule, after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the electorate via public service channels in a televised message, which has been recorded but the content is still classified.
Putin leads the United Russia party, which is expected to win the election by a landslide.
The president's behavior at yesterday's reception of foreign ambassadors revealed nothing but another outburst against Western interference, a favorite theme of the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, and we want to have honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any kind of violation of the law", he added.
But the opposition says that's not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they say was used to pressure voters.
The head of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, claims that "such a dirty election was not in Russia even during the time of Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on last weekend's protests, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized protest, and according to his lawyer, he is still unable to be visited.
"Russians still think as 'homo sovieticus'", he said.
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's next in line to Putin?
The date for the first round of the presidential election was announced yesterday in the Official Gazette, which will be held on March 2, 2008, and candidates can indicate their intention to run until December 23.
As Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate cannot be extended any further.
There's no other successor in sight.
- What role does Putin play in March?
You're going to be Prime Minister?
Or will he, as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia party and the parliamentary majority, decide on the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power will win both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's become a tradition.
"Russians still think in a 'homo sovieticus' way: they don't feel they have control over their own destiny", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Kopossov, a historian at St. Petersburg University, goes even further: According to his theory, Christianity arrived in the country 500 years later than in Europe, and thus the development of civil society was delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalistic model that suited the people perfectly, all the more so because this new kind of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation but by a certain economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians "consciously reject personal responsibility", as was quickly demonstrated after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of United Russia are headed by 65 governors, who are chosen from the heads of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West is often embodied in chaos, as it was in the 1990s.
Public opinion is favoring stability.
In this spirit, Russians don't vote for extremist parties either.
Tamara Chereednytsenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
The people in power aren't so bad, so why should we replace them?"
The Troubling Memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen archive has been made public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archival documents, which cover 27 kilometers of shelves in Bad Arolsen, in the state of Hessen, have so far been searchable only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, to provide individual and named insights for past victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, eleven countries - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archive will allow historians to research "the transfer of prisoners, the health of camp inhabitants and forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive, which is managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, opposed the publication of the documents, since they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, some of the deported victims may be allegedly homosexual or mentally disabled.
After the war, the collection of concentration camp records and arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo was started for practical reasons, to identify civilians who had been deported or sentenced to forced labor and to provide evidence of their internment, which could be used to obtain compensation.
Bad Arolsen currently has over 300 permanent employees processing tens of thousands of unique requests.
However, some in the scientific community do not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of high importance.
"These documents contain basically nothing new", declared Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the research center on anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
EU and India to sign free trade agreement in 2008
The annual volume of bilateral trade between India and Europe is now close to 60 billion euros.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, announced European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath.
Already in April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the go-ahead to open negotiations on free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India's largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th largest trading partner, according to the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could be an economic boost for both sides" and "help India to increase its presence in a booming market of 450 million people".
The EU and India will meet on Friday in New Delhi as part of the eighth EU-India Diplomatic Summit, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
(Source AFP) The report was made public by the BBC.
In response to concerns, the Bank of England is offering the money market £10 billion for a five-week term
The Bank of England, eager to ease the credit crunch, announced Thursday that it would pump 10 billion pounds into the money market, at a base rate of 5.75%, and, unlike usual, this time with a five-week maturity.
"We want to allay concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we want banks to be able to plan their liquidity positions more safely for this period. e Bank will therefore offer a significant part of its reserves on the international money market in a five-week open market operation from 6 December", the bank said in a press release.
The bank announced that £10 billion (14 billion euros) will be floated on December 6 at 12:15 local time, with the bid being at the central bank's prime rate and the repayment deadline on January 10.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued cash for five weeks in an open market operation.
The normal running time for these operations is one week.
The Bank of England added in a press release that it was "ready to take further action" to bring interbank lending into line with the central bank's base rate.
The current interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been above the level of 18 September, currently standing at 6,6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England has been charging a substantial penalty interest on the money pumped into the market, which has deterred banks from using it.
The rumour (confirmed by the development of the pound against the euro) is that many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have obtained at a lower interest rate and with greater discretion.
The UMP and the NC refuse to consider the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the socialist articles of the bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text itself.
The text, which was discussed at a meeting initiated by the Socialists, contained about ten measures adopted by the national bureau of the Socialist Party on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment supplement, the reinstatement of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of travellers' cheques and the limitation of rental rates.
As the UMP and the NC voted against the review of the articles by a margin of 180 to 115, the discussion between the government and the opposition, which occasionally became sharp, was interrupted only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would resubmit all his group's proposals as part of the amendment to the draft amending financial law, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A New Festival Is Born
There have been rumors of a new music festival in Philadelphia being organized by C3 Presents, but now the promoter and organizer of the event has announced that they will be partnering with Melvin Benn's British production company, Festival Republic, to host the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey.
"We are honored to be working with someone who is the catalyst of the modern American festival movement", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also hosts the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey is in the summer, so there's plenty of time for camping.
The festival will be held August 8-10, at a 500-acre private estate about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival directors in the world.
In 1989 he started organising the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his range of events by organising the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner and co-producer of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of 177,500 people.
C3's Charlie Jones described the Glastonbury Festival as the 'most inspiring event' he has ever attended, and added that his company and Melvin Benn's company were working together to provide the region with a European-style festival.
"The Philadelphia location was chosen early on, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to put this festival in the heart of Philadelphia", said Charlie Jones.
'We have been pursuing a case with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, the political maneuvering of the city government has led to the failure of the organization", continued Charlie Jones.
"We were fortunate to have had this conversation with Melvin Benn, and we are now preparing to host a huge festival in another unique venue, ultimately serving the interests of the people of Philadelphia".
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, after having already proven their exceptional festival management skills with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The gross revenue for the two events was $9.8 million and $11.3 million in 2007 respectively.
Both festivals were held in urban settings.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on a rural festival, whereas our festivals are usually held in urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to somehow combine the two models and create both the rural feel of Europe and the urban feel of America".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, and the mayor himself, are enthusiastically supporting the event", says Charlie Jones.
Although he did not give details of the agreement, he did say that "the terms are favorable enough to allow investment in such a large event in a venue that will hopefully be home to the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "enormous", with a capacity roughly equivalent to the 80,000-seat Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already received invitations to the event, but at the time of the press conference, nothing is final.
"Vineland is basically a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of music for everyone to enjoy", says Charlie Jones.
Jones and two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, are the founders of C3, which won the "best independent event organizer" award at the recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal is facing off against the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal when you're fighting the Terminator himself...
"Seduce" is part of the Montreal envoy's mission.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes the filming of his own productions abroad.
Is it really that hard to take on the Terminator Governor?
"We have to be careful because the film industry decides for itself which is the best location for it.
If he finds that Montreal has favorable conditions, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on which to win", says Schwarzenegger.
Competing for the Festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now focused on promoting Canadian films.
The Oscars are about to begin.
The goal is to show and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it's the Sundance Film Festival, or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
L'Âge des ténèbres was well received at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's also being screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be shown in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market?
With less than five weeks until the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to the usual end-of-year hair.
But this year, it is not clear to experts whether that will actually happen.
According to Banif, 'Statistically, the stock market is generally positive in December.
However, forecasts based on statistics alone are not necessarily correct, and in fact, in the current situation, the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term.'
Experts are not at all in favour of the stock market's end-of-year performance, although they state that 'the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, which gives an opportunity for investment, as there are no guaranteed alternatives, in particular fixed yields, which are negatively affected by the move towards quality securities, both long and short-term'.
As a result, they believe that the stock market will be characterized by a more sideways, volatile movement, "especially as the effects of the Fed rate cut are not yet known, as the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tensions are also threatening".
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees with this, that is, he thinks it would be risky to announce that there will be a rally.
The expert says that "the situation is not at all rosy".
Ibex is down nearly 4 percent from its peak on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts are so prescient.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the wallets and the usual pension fund deposits at this time.
However, the expert adds that this year some change is expected, as the rally is moved to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would influence market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, says that we are close to the technical level and "therefore we are seeing a decline in the stock market index, which may rise depending on the news coming from the US, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst is confident that these will be favorable.
Analysts agree on which securities will be targeted to reach the new maximum quotas of the Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "the big securities are the order of the day this year".
The expert would add the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, "because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco says that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The construction companies can also benefit from the rally, if it happens at all.
'The ACS has been trying for months to recover its position and we hope that Ferrovial and the FCC construction companies will follow this path,' says the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main driver for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies can also do well, although the Spanish market is not very well represented in this area.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, there have been only two December inflation events.
The real year-end rally was in 2003, when the stock market emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the tech bubble.
In December of that year, when Ibex 35 was revised down to 28.17%, it registered a 6.68% increase.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive year of profit (currently the Ibex is growing by 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally will take place.
Banco Popular Español opens 200 branches, open from Monday to Saturday, 12 hours a day
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
Those accounts are operated under the name Popular Max, and they're a big change for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, since this is the first group whose branches are open irregularly until 20.30 in the evening, and even on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 pm.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced that it plans to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's currently in the process of negotiating with the union to close 75% of its branches in exchange for opening them one afternoon, albeit not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be decisive for the other institutions in deciding whether to join the initiative to promote more favourable opening of shops.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target the individuals who shop at these places, the small and medium-sized enterprises, the individual entrepreneurs and the local shops.
The bank wants to operate 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the opening of the above mentioned opening, as it is not a new opening but a transformation of the existing one.
To this end, the institution is modernising its branches in the commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is accompanied by a new conception of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, more colorful design.
Ángel Rivera, the head of commercial banks, points out that the restructuring does not require a large investment, but rather more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, which will also include a SME-specific trading room, will also sell non-financial products.
Pleasant experiences
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in three Madrid branches.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
The selection of the desks in Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets was the right decision, according to Rivero.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 branches.
Another 60 are operated under the name Mundocredit, specialised in immigration, and also have very favourable opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
The units mentioned by PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers", Rivero points out.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones with the help of external staff.
Telecinco has doubled the market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
"We did it".
With this phrase, yesterday, at the close of the market, Paolo Vasile, Telecinco's adviser, expressed his satisfaction when it was revealed that the TV station he ran had doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Something, however, overshadowed his joy: "It's just painful that it's not because we've climbed higher, but because we've fallen lower", he said.
However, he stressed that in the weak market, "we were less profitable".
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
This increase places the annual loss at 15.66%.
The company is owned by Mediaset (52%) and Vocento (13%), with a market value of EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Its rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52% yesterday and has seen a 40.5% drop since January, dropping to 2.193.46 million yesterday.
The other listed communications companies are valued at 3,571 million for Sogecable, 2,518,53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarities between the two companies.
The question is how much can we accomplish in the same market, at what cost, and how does that translate into viewership?
Telecinco announced last week that it would be the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, a consultant to Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising subsidiary.
If the announced event were to take place, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% in the current financial year, compared to the 965,4 million committed in the 2006 financial year.
Antena 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the financial year (to 734,4 million), while the net television turnover increased by 0,7% (630,4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that have contributed to the strength of Telecinco's stock market is the high pay out it has maintained up to now: in 2006, the company, headed by its President Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio may change after the acquisition of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum of 50% payment, "although we have always given out much more.
I hope that this year our shareholders will be pleased with us, as we have already done them a favor by acquiring 33% of Endemol".
Analysts are saying that the market is currently experiencing a slight downturn.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its return estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
This is explained by the fact that the estimated increase in sales decreased from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
According to the same company's forecasts, the profit of Antena 3 will decrease by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
The first.
Ibersecurities: recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly because of their high dividend yield and long-term sustainability potential.
Two, two.
Caja Madrid: prefers Telecinco (acquisition) to Antena 3 (retention) because of its 'multiple appeal' and its business strength.
The third.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends underweighting because of 'similar risks' (a saturated market and a more unfavourable economic climate).
Congress approves the acquisition of MiFID effective November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary process - which ended today with the congressional vote approving the Senate amendments - the government has initiated a social dialogue on the legislation underlying the law, so that both can be implemented before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of the representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to establish the most favorable legislation to protect investors and to regulate in detail the activities of companies in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the market.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Law, will allow the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory powers of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new Directive allows the provision of financial advisory services to specialist firms, but also to natural or legal persons, and establishes a new type of financial services company (ESIS) alongside securities dealers, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the Act increases the number of systems capable of executing transactions involving financial instruments, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and internalised order fulfilling systems that compete with existing stock exchange players.
Furthermore, the Act requires investment firms to provide market information on the key aspects of their business profile, their risk-taking and risk management methods, and to keep records of all transactions carried out in order to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Congressional Committee on Economic Affairs has introduced a number of amendments, most notably to treat securitised debt as a "complex" asset because of the high risk it poses to investors, as was the case with US subprime mortgages.
On the other hand, the transposition of the Directive was also used to legally define the scope of the activities of those with a degree in economics and entrepreneurship, 30 years after the entry into force in 1977 of the Royal Decree laying down the professional functions which could only be performed by economists.
The Senate also proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as a broker-dealer, who works for someone else, does not need the authorisation of the CNMV and can market products or acquire clients for several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index rose by 0.5 points in November to reach 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat uses to calculate the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the development of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that are comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of the time of their origin and in terms of their nature.
The same calculation method is used for the preliminary indicator as for the calculation of the CPI, but the statistical modelling method differs for the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office stressed that the provisional figure is purely indicative and may therefore differ from the final figures, which will be published on 14 December.
'The CPI remains relatively high.'
Pedro Solbes, one of the vice-presidents of the government and Minister of Economy, stated that the increase of the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only "temporary" but at the same time he predicted that the price index was expected to show a "relatively high" value in the coming months.
In the corridors of Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "even if the indicator is not very favourable", Spain's inflation rate within monetary union had remained more or less stable over the past years.
He added that November "had fewer surprises" than the previous month, when the Government had not expected such a large increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", the Minister of Economy admitted in relation to the data released earlier today.
Virgin wants to get 42 billion euros in three years through Northern Rock.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to just £12 billion (€16.8 billion) since it was forced to take an emergency loan from the Bank of England in mid-September.
It had a record £25 billion in deposits, which had been gradually reduced over the past two and a half months by the loss of customer confidence, despite the government's promise of a 100% guarantee to the bank until the crisis was over.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial trading name, Virgin Money, and Virgin will need to acquire about a quarter of the revenues of UK banks over the next three years to acquire the remaining £18 billion to meet the £30 billion target.
Richard Branson's group, a prestigious businessman known for his high-profile advertising campaigns in England, plans to spend some £50 million (€70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to reach its goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the Virgin consortium's offer as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested on suspicion of corruption.
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana, in the province of Murcia, this morning, on suspicion of being involved in the city's corruption scandal that erupted this week.
Besides, a secretary of the Town Hall and the chief of the police of the settlement were arrested.
In May, former city council member José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, a member of the People's Party, who was the head of the corruption network, according to official sources interviewed by SER radio.
Police are continuing to investigate at city offices and the Urban Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer is also under investigation as a prime suspect in this week's corruption scandal.
According to information from the radio station SER, the lawyer of the populist Juan Morales was arrested as he was leaving Morales with a documentation on corruption in his briefcase.
Police sources say the investigation is about a fee that Morales allegedly received in exchange for signing a development agreement with a Galician construction company to redevelop 200 acres of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono will accept the PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and the presidency of the Parliament if they win the elections.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialist Party José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE's Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to take over the presidency of the parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party's federal headquarters today at noon after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister justified his choice of the former minister by saying that "we have to count with the best" in politics, and that Bono is "among the best".
He also added that it was "probable" that the Manchai politician would be the Socialist Party's candidate for the post of President of Parliament if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono will take over from the current parliamentary president, Manuel Marín, who announced on November 15 that he does not intend to run in the next elections and will give up his political career to fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister has been constantly pressuring him to return to the political arena since he gave up active politics two years ago.
He also added that since voters are aware of who will be the economic vice-president in the event of a Socialist victory, the party would like to inform them, "in the name of transparency", who will be the President of Parliament.
If Bono is to be the next president, he would like the Parliament to be a "theatre of respect, not of abuse or shouting" and to be more like the home of the citizens.
"Sometimes it seems that the Parliament is the only place in Madrid where we can't talk in peace, it's happened 26 times that the Prime Minister's speech was interrupted in the Senate".
He praised the current president, Manuel Marín, for his "excellent work", but did not want to present himself as president, lest his opponents consider him "a dominator".
Campaign for the climate
Since the climate change movement relentlessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who favor political or social battles, it must be very strong.
He should even have a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero on his side, who says the movement is more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and who says "we must make a new deal with our land".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to Spain's leading role within the Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance with the convention, what sectors are affected and why has the government not done anything to prevent it?
In addition, it should clearly explain to the Spanish people what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings can be expected at individual and societal level and what will be the economic consequences?
I mean, who has to make the sacrifice and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have not been and will not be given an explanation for these questions.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change action, actual action, is always unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and costly to both businesses and the public.
Even the PSOE's gas price hike would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing, with mere propaganda, empty words with no real consequences.
With conventions, committees, protocols, new officers.
The Earth Treaty, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and even embellishes the election meetings and inspires tenderness in us.
The
The mayor of Totana and the chief of police have been arrested in a suspected corruption case.
Police arrested the mayor of the city of Totana, Murcai province, José Martínez Andre, the local police chief, the city hall secretary and a catering company for crimes related to urban development, police sources said today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and taken to City Hall, where he is currently being held by several police officers, many of whom are investigating the Urban Development Council and the municipal agency in charge of the Industrial and Housing Administration.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on Monday in a case where two hectares of agricultural land were converted into a building site to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 apartments after illegally paying a commission to its directors during their previous mandate.
Two other individuals have not been arrested yet but are under investigation, according to the 1st Court of Appeal.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, former Totana mayor Juan Morales, now an independent MP for the Popular Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also under investigation, as is the former mayor's current girlfriend, who lives in the provincial capital of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A, a lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), together with the director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G. The latter company is also part of the Nuaria Group and through it the corruption was carried out.
The investigation is being carried out by the Local Government Crime Unit of the Central Operative Unit of the Police, whose members, in addition to the arrests, have carried out 11 house searches, mainly in companies related to the arrested, operating in Madrid, Vigobá, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, one person was arrested, the owner of a well-known local poultry company who may have been a middleman.
The Nuaria Group was to create the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified, and the project would have doubled the population of the settlement, which currently has 25,000 residents.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as real estate broker Autesa e Inomonuar, Conycase, which manages the car parks at Coruna, Venezuela and Katolikus Ferdinánd, Vigoban, Hogartel, which specialises in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which specialises in the sale, promotion and installation of building components.
Things that happen
The first.
If it's all right with you, we'll put aside the Book of the Month for a while and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I already have one.
People, life is constantly changing.
Of course, everyone can make up their own minds.
Two, two.
Our correspondent in Finland found this comment in one of the largest daily newspapers in Finland, the Helsingin Sanomat, probably the top PISA report on the state of the world's literacy, referring to the fact that it was published on November 18th, at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn's book.
"Philosophical teachings were introduced to the public after the tragedy at Jokela High School.
The killer, a student about to graduate, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Council, Pekka Elo, in charge of philosophy, demanded in the pages of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers examine the teachings of Plato with a critical eye, and then added that knowledge of Nietzsche was not necessarily important in the compulsory elementary philosophy classes of secondary schools".
The third.
One of his colleagues informs us that the Penal Code contains an offence related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is a misdemeanor punishable by six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal a disc worth less than 400 euros from a shop, it is only an offence (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal €1,000 worth of goods from a shop, theft is a crime, but the penalty is still below the penalty for downloading from the Internet (Article 234 of the BCC).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty still does not reach the penalty for Internet downloading (Article 244.1).
D. You'll get less punishment for fighting than for copying CDs.
If you participate in a mass brawl, you can be fined from three months to one year (Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), but for copying a CD, you can be fined from six months to two years
The Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties.
E. According to Article 184.2 of the CPC, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors shall be punished more severely than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, someone's gotten a little out of control.

My GP gave me an article about some strange research entitled "Money Causes Brain Activity, Especially When Others Have Less of It".
So the feelings of the workers on payday are affected by how much everyone else gets.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance tomography, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
The study's author and head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, says: "The strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly and the partner made a mistake".
The researchers found that when both men gave the right answer and received the same amount of money, their brain activity was moderate, but when either of them received double the amount, their brain activity was enhanced.
I have no idea why it took so much science to reach such a simple conclusion.
Attorney General for the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court for the crimes committed in The Hague and the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
Her term expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a bit of a sour expression, as the people responsible for the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered, namely General Ratko Mladic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary film, Carla's List (2006, not yet released in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York, as she tries to put pressure on the governments concerned to put the fugitives on the run.
What kind of insurance is good for me?
Motor insurance, which provides protection for the owner of a motor vehicle against various types of damage, involves a considerable expense and depends on a number of factors, such as age, sex, date of licence, marital status, type of motor vehicle to be insured and type of use.
Getting the car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car to buy.
First, we need to know what it is.
Motor insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company will pay the fixed insurance premium in order to receive compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is basically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, the date of obtaining a driver's license, marital status, the type of car to be insured, its use, and so on.
Insurance companies set the premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. the higher the premium, the higher the risk of an accident.
That's why people over 25 or women pay less, because statistically they're less likely to be at risk, because they're more careful.
Similarly, studies have led insurance companies to conclude that married people are less likely to cause accidents than are single people.
The frequency of use of the car is the determining factor.
The more frequently used the greater the chance of an accident.
Insurance companies take a number of factors into account when setting the premium.
The owner must therefore do a thorough search to select the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the most important factors in the selection process, so that the insured person's needs can be best met and a reasonable price can be established.
When taking out insurance, those under 25 face a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of their licence.
Although the ideal is to be insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
The more cautious drivers can take out full insurance with their car, so they're protected from all hazards and the cost is affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured party pays for some of the damage.
'The amount of the premium that the insured person has to pay depends on the premium; the higher the premium, the lower the premium,' says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa, the Spanish online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third party liability insurance, where the customer insures himself against damage caused to others but not to his own car.
In addition, you will be insured against theft, fire, and loss of your car.
That's good advice.
If you are under 25, be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus and thus reduce the amount you will have to pay in the future.
The benefits granted in relation to the basic rate of the insurance company are called bonuses.
The penalty for the basic rate is called the malus.
'The amount of the bonus and the premium depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonus", explains Noguera.
If they are over 25, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, since the risk of accidents is reduced by the experience gained over the years.
At this time, we recommend that you take out full insurance.
"In general, young people are not yet able to apply their experience to a single accident, even when driving", says the Spanish director of a European insurance company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already overcome the fear of newcomers.
If you are already married but do not have children, it is best to take out a comprehensive insurance policy, provided that your financial situation allows it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky clients, so the premium is lower for them.
In this case, it is best to have a complete insurance coverage for the parts themselves (up to 300 euros), or if you have a higher premium, you can extend the coverage to cover damage caused to others from the third year of the motor vehicle.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have more customers and can afford to have a higher self-pay", confirms Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, the full insurance is recommended in instalments (around EUR 150), or it can be extended to cover liability insurance if the premium is higher.
Motor vehicle insurance is very important, not only because it provides protection for the owner in the event of an accident, but also because it is a major expense, so it is essential to choose the right form of insurance for you.
Celtic are trying to score points in Milan to get to the last eight.
Milan and Celtic will be meeting at the San Siro on Tuesday to pick up the missing points in the Champions League final, giving the Italians the lead and the Scots the chance to qualify.
The Italians have 10 points and have already secured a draw with Portugal in the fifth round, while Celtic have nine, but would need another to prevent Shakhtar, who have six points, from overtaking the four-point Benfica.
The two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan have to play in Japan for the Club World Cup, where they will try to advance to the last 16 in the semi-finals on the 13th.
This will bring Group D to a close before the others, and although the most likely outcome at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be a draw, both teams will be looking to win, as the Italians don't want to lose at home, and Celtic could be the first to start from a better position in the round of 16.
Gordon Strachan's team even loses enough to qualify if Shakhtar win, but it can't be guaranteed, because if there is a tie, the Ukrainians will go on, who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the Scots' night worse, as they look to reach the last eight of the re-organized Champions League for the second time in a row, after being beaten by Kaká in extra time (1-0) in the previous season.
If Rossoneri win, Shakhtar will be the most happy, because if they lose, Celtic will be in the last eight and will stay in UEFA.
Because Benfica, despite being in last place and having no chance of staying in the European championship, could still get third place with a win that could be played in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first show of the Spice Girls' tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, performing in front of 20,000 people for the first time since their breakup in 2000.
Shortly before the concert at GM Place in Vancouver, "Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) announced that the band was "in great shape".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also featured a video about the band's history of huge success in the 1990s.
The band's reunion and tour coincided with the release of a new album in Spain by EMI, which included the major hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls are wearing bracelets given to them by Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was there in the packed auditorium at GM Place, although Victoria had forbidden it a few days earlier.
Speaking at the opening of the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "hasn't seen our dresses yet, so I'm nervous about what she'll think of the show".
'Sporty Spice', was the reason why the band broke up two years after he left the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also appeared nervous during the press conference held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I could see that people's feelings, that people's feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I did", Chisholm said of the band, which he had broken up with nine years earlier.
The singer added that in time "things have settled down and we love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls last played in 1998.
CTV reports the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines plane.
At the airport, they were met by a group of babysitters.
They have five children, seven in all.
After the vancouveri concert, the band will perform in California (USA), then in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They're playing in Madrid on December 23rd.
New fears over Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
A gas dispute has erupted between Ukraine and Russia, which could affect Russian fuel to be shipped to Western Europe.
Much of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) passes through Ukraine, and disputes between the two nations are always the subject of intense attention.
Kiev has stated that if Moscow raises the price of gas paid by Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with a higher transit cost.
One, the drop in supplies to EU countries, was the result of a previous dispute between the two countries that erupted last year.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow involves the attempted agreement between the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, on the price of gas that Ukraine will pay to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that a 50% price increase over the 2008 price agreement with Ukraine should be implemented for gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of Gazprom's shipment to Ukraine.
'It is important that we make the case during the negotiations as one of the most important transit countries for natural gas,' Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to the debate on the cost of transit through Ukraine (and to Western Europe)".
As a result of the latest major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the pipeline to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino effect on exports to Western Europe, which also significantly depressed prices.
One quarter of the European Union's gas supply is Russian gas.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom supplies its own gas supply to Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS 'must control foreign workers'
NHS boards in Scotland should improve their checks on criminal records of workers coming from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
The proposal was put forward by the Auditor General, Robert Black, after a doctor in Scotland, a foreign national, was linked to the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland did not have accurate figures on the number of overseas workers.
However, it also identified key controls that were carried out properly in its report, using a sample of five health authorities.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the Auditor-General checked the list of employees recruited from outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed into the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors who were questioned by video link at the Old Bailey on charges of attempted car bombings in the UK in October.
NHS committees must check the qualifications and work experience of their staff from overseas countries and their UK work permits before they begin to work.
Although the Scottish Health Boards use Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, the agency is not authorised to obtain such information from outside the United Kingdom.
The Auditor General's report suggested, amongst other things, that the committees introduce the Criminal Records Bureau's guide, which facilitates the employer's control processes with various overseas countries.
"While evidence of such checks has been found in personnel records, they are not carried out on a regular basis", states the report.
Black said that while the Scottish NHS had a high level of performance in its pre-employment screening process, he added: 'Our report highlights areas of improvement in the system to ensure we have up-to-date information on the number of overseas staff in the NHS.'
Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "highly unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS staff who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
'The report shows that the pre-employment checks currently in place are working well in NHS Scotland and the value of the recommendations is not yet clear,' she added.
The Scottish health authorities estimate that their current overseas staff, consisting mainly of doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the Auditor-General pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, partly due to the fact that committees have problems identifying staff on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures implemented in the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, the Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures included the control of passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the guidelines and guidance on pre-employment checks for NHS overseas staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was delighted to see this task completed after the Glasgow airport attack.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, would take into account the recommendations in the report and ensure that the updated guidance on pre-employment checks for all staff, including those from overseas, reflected best practice.
Joy Division is in the movie awards
The biopic of the late lead singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, Control, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards - including Best Film.
Also awarded were the lead actor, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis's role, and director Anton Corbijn and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
The best actress award went to Dame Judi Dench for her performance in the thriller "Details of a Scandal".
And the Variety award for bringing British film into the international spotlight went to Bond actor Daniel Craig.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise through the ranks of Joy Division to 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The black and white film, which also features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack, cost just £3 million to make.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn - who previously made his name with the cover of U2's "Joshua Tree" - did win two awards; best director and best new director.
Rock music was another highlight of the ceremony; Julien Temple's film about Joe Strummer, the lead singer of the Clash, won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his performance as the driver of the mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London thriller Murdered Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough-guy roles, has been awarded the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose credits include "Scum", "Scoop", and "Sexy Dog", is currently filming "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to accept the award named after his "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" star, Harris, who passed away in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors for people like me", Winstone added.
"I feel truly fortunate to have met Richard Harris on more than one occasion.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time and I have a great respect for him".
The selection of the independent film awards, known as Bifa, is decided by a panel of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom, who are also the founding members of Bifa.
208 people arrested in Saudi Arabia in connection with a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants affiliated with terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on an oil refinery and a series of attacks on church personnel and security forces.
State television in the world's largest oil exporter says one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to a television report, a cell of eight men led by a resident of foreign nationality planned to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
Following an attempted Al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
The report, quoting the interior minister, said that 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a "rocket-firing specialist" who crossed the border illegally.
The report also said that the militants tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
Of those arrested, 22 were plotting attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take a tougher line against the flow of Saudis into Iraq to join Al-Qaeda fighters fighting allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, who are considered heretics by Saudi hardline Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda fighters are seen by a significant number of Saudi religious leaders as being drawn into the political circle of the royal family that controls the government.
The group's fighters, spurred by calls by Saudi-born Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the targeting of the pro-Western Saudi government, have targeted foreign settlements, government buildings, and energy facilities.
"The security forces have made a tremendous effort in the last...five months", an Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
The arrests included a 16-person "media cell" in Medina that was aimed at spreading "takfiri thinking", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that advocates violent action against Muslims who are branded disloyal and apostate.
The arrested also included 32 individuals accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate of Venus may provide a glimpse into Earth's future
Scientists yesterday said Venus once had a pleasant environment.
Data from a European spacecraft orbiting the planet suggests that this planet may be considered more of a capricious twin to Earth than we previously thought.
Venus is Earth's nearest planetary neighbor.
The two planets are almost the same size and orbit, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions very similar to Earth's, and even habitable conditions.
But with a dramatically high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, Venus has entered a radically different evolutionary path.
Today, the planet's water has evaporated, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it's being ravaged by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, based on a year-long study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could take place on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is beginning to be understood why the climate of Venus differs so much from that of Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are very similar in structure.
"Our new data has allowed us to develop a scenario for the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it might have had Earth-like habitable conditions.
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
One kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was being examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
The gates are wide open
Mitt Romney says it's not appropriate for a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
But the Republican presidential candidates did agree to participate in a YouTube-streamed debate, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and passed them on to the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday night, November 28th, turned out to be as ridiculous as the one posed by the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected the state of the Republican Party as we approached next year's elections.
It's not yet known how the CNN executives who co-financed the debate selected the YouTube clips to be distributed to the candidates.
The longest question in the first half-hour debate was on immigration.
This is one of the Republican party's most contentious issues.
CNN asked some voters who were unsure if they were being told something that was troubling them to say, "I've heard a number that the moderator has found to be a strong consensus when the candidates have been tough on the border issue".
The most intense and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, who was leading the nation, and Romney, who was leading the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the perception that he's been too lax on the issue of illegal immigration during his time as mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his former Massachusetts governor's house.
The debate between the two became particularly heated when the questioner asked about supporting "amnesty" (which would grant permanent status and citizenship to illegal immigrants).
Some of the candidates with fewer votes - such as Representatives Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado - have managed to delve deep into the issue.
And although none of them are considered likely candidates, their continued presence in the race may be explained by the fact that they were the first to raise the immigration bell.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is a broad consensus among the candidates: a common goal of strengthening borders and a strong stance against illegal immigrants.
This issue, along with the fear of Chinese toys and other worries from the outside world, is helping to obliterate or minimize the divide between libertarians and Christian conservatives within the Republican ranks.
When other issues came up, however, the debate turned unpleasantly violent.
Giuliani was faced with the question of why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Romney argued over whether simulated drowning constitutes torture.
Another questioner wanted to know if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Stumbling over this question, Giuliani finally settled on the view that, although he considered the Bible to be his favorite book, he might not take the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was raised as to whether Jesus would approve of capital punishment.
And so, in the face of expectations, Mike Huckabee, the first-place finisher in the just-concluded Iowa primary, who credits his victory to a strong Christian conservatism, responded by saying that the death penalty is painful, but it's necessary.
When asked if Jesus would have sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for office.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's spirited rise in Iowa coincides with libertarian Ron Paul's fund-raising drive and the enthusiastic cheers he received at Wednesday's debate.
The sudden breakthrough of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet been able to launch a joint candidate from among aspirants representing more familiar and traditional principles.
In 1980 and in 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who timely and convincingly proclaimed a victorious message of American greatness, and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
But now the party is divided, and the consequences are unforeseeable.
Labour Party pain
Another gap before Gordon Brown; the way out remains unchanged
In the face of British political scandals, this one doesn't seem too spicy.
No one has sold their honor, no politician has had his Paris hotel bills exposed, no one has committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman had secretly contributed over 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) to the governing British Labour Party for over four years under the names of others, and that the party had not reported this, is one of the things that the circumstantial Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister was voted out of office, and when he made a rash statement that the outcome of the election was not influenced by the polls, he questioned the intelligence of the British people, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat's deputy leader, noted with increasingly witty remarks, the once-feared Brown Stalin has morphed into Mr. Bean.
The failure to rescue the distressed bank Northern Rock exposed regulatory weaknesses and shortcomings in judgment.
The sick proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interests to join forces with the government.
The leak of 25 million people's personal data by the IRS exposed an unimaginable level of administrative incompetence.
In the House of Lords, three Western generals have sparked a riot, protesting against the cuts to the army budget, saying that the position of Minister of Defence is a part-time job.
And now here are the secret donations of David Abrahams, Peter Watt, the general secretary of the Labour Party, who has resigned.
These accidents don't mean that Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach a point beyond which control is impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
But as it becomes clear that the prime minister is unlikely to be able to see things ahead, and may not stay in office for long, the suspension of disbelief ends: the civil service begins to leak, cabinet ministers go into briefings, the press looks for bad news, and the government becomes defensive and unable to focus.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult position, since unlike other political leaders, he is not considered to be "fresh blood".
As much as he'd like to deny his connection to Tony Blair, he was his right-hand man.
The problems with Northern Rock and the IRS records, for example, are tied to decisions made during Brown's Treasury Department.
And while he was not directly involved in Blair's misdeeds, such as the protracted investigation into the relationship between the "nobility for money" case and political party funding, voters are entitled to assume otherwise.
While Brown's situation is uncomfortable, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The shootings are not as frightening as those toros make them out to be.
Just like Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was directly recruited.
And reparations, painful as they may be, can bring about the kind of direction that Stalin in Brown always promised: a government that is reliable, solid and a little rough.
A good example is the political donation scam.
The mysterious Abrahams of Garboia, who compares his donation to charity, said that he did not want to reveal his goodness to the public.
Perhaps so, but it was not his decision to make.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and well-founded: the public has a right to know who is knocking at the door of the country's rulers.
Watt, who says he knew about Abrahams's action but was unaware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during the hearings, as will Jon Medleson, the Labour party's foundation chairman, who learned of the confused donations in October.
Brown, however, is currently off the hook: there is no indication that he knew about these coils, not even that the huge payments were made after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of his job.
While he quickly condemned the party's violation of the law, he diluted his firmness by resorting to familiar devices; he appointed a commission headed by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the matter, for safety's sake.
In this story, the "lesson to be learned" is not very complicated.
In the case of a criminal offence, the police are responsible.
Brown also has other things to sort out, such as appointing the chairman of the independent committee on public policy, which has been without a leader for six months, or advancing an effective reform of party funding.
This would require the hard-line Labour Party to break with the Tories and the special financial ties with the unions - a tough sell for the hard-line Brown.
But you have to face some facts about the party.
Polls show the Conservatives are currently leading by a wide margin; Brown has two years to win back voters; the only way to win is through impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis threatening the U.S. credit card market?
If blood gets into the water, it's natural that sharks will appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weak, predators are focusing on the nation's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit, the credit card market could lose up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the depreciation rate, which represents the ratio of bad loans, and the default rate, which represents the ratio of late payments over 30 days, increased.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss last month in the U.S. consumer finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
But the panic is still early.
The rate of write-downs and late payments remains low.
The Moody's late payment rate of 3.89% for the third quarter is a full percentage point below the historical average.
The decrease in rates is partly due to technical factors.
The 2005 amendment to the US insolvency rules for individuals led to a sudden drop in the number of insolvency filings, but also caused a large loss in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcy applications (and thus the write-down rate) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether the overall borrowing conditions deteriorate or not.
The payment rate, which is the ratio of monthly repayments of consumer credit, is also solid on the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card-backed securities is also quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at TowerGroup, a research firm, estimates that the 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers are accumulating credit card debt to pay off home loans.
However, card issuers monitor primarily cash movements rather than asset values, and so a fall in house prices does not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may even be advantageous for the creditors.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage, consumers have less incentive to pay off the loan; as a result, the repayment of credit card debt is given higher priority.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions more quickly and flexibly than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of a sudden revaluation of assets.
"It's unlikely that we'll wake up one day and have to completely revalue loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
If a subprime-type crash in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much more likely.
If falling housing prices and a credit crunch are pushing America into recession, the industry is certainly facing a difficult future.
These predatory swimming birds are worth watching.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case
On Wednesday, three British bankers pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the fraud of former Enron CFO Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud, alleging that they had collaborated with Fastow in a secret scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers.
Their trial started in January.
But at a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein, Jr., each of them admitted to a single fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in the UK during the two-year extradition procedure.
The investigation into the Enron collapse in 2001 in the United States is still ongoing.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers, dubbed the "NatWest Three", are accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 to prepare the fraud with Fastow and Fastow's right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
Fastow, responsible for orchestrating numerous fraudulent schemes that led to Enron's bankruptcy, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was not aware of any interest in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware of the size of the interest.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a stake in this company.
The indictment alleges that Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would purchase a $20 million stake in a subsidiary of Greenwich NatWest.
But in reality, the $20 million was in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution believes the bankers got $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others got $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana state prison.
Kopper is serving three years and one month in a Texas prison.
The three Englishmen were allowed to travel to the United States, where they are staying during the trial, on bail of $1 million each.
Enron, the seventh largest company in the United States, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks failed to cover millions of dollars in debt and in businesses that were seen as profitable but were actually losing money.
The collapse has caused thousands of jobs to be lost, a market value of over $60 billion, and a pension fund that has been reduced by over $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their role in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges leveled against Lay were dropped with his death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow.
Starting at $54 million, a Rolls-Royce-powered Gulfstream G550 aircraft that can fly nonstop between Moscow and Los Angeles with a tank.
But for some wealthy Russians, this amount is just a nickel.
"It can hold 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"But nobody orders that many seats, because the machines are bought for private families or for corporate executives".
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors to the four-day exclusive Millionaire's Fair, held in the huge exhibition halls around the capital.
Along with Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods companies rented booths at the show, hoping to interest Russian new-millionaires in everything from Mahogany-studded yachts to diamond-encased 50-cent refrigerator grills.
Mr. Firer was looking carefully at the bright orange Porsche on display in the booth next to him.
"Nice car, but it's not even close to our products", he said.
"Russia is the second largest market for private jets after the United States".
It seems the Russian capital is swimming in money, like Dallas did in its heyday during the oil boom.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were considered material here", said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at Harvard's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi gamblers of the 1970's and the Japanese gamblers of the 1990's, the Russians have now emerged as the world's most spectacular spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are claiming their share of the gold rush.
At another luxury industry conference in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of the world's richest people, Russia is home to 53 billionaires with a combined wealth of $282 billion.
Moreover, Russia's second-rate millionaires number 103,000 and have a combined fortune of $670 billion, according to a study of personal wealth trends in the former Soviet Union by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(According to World Bank data, in 2005 the number of people living below the poverty line in Russia was 15.8 percent.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris jewelry in London.
Nicole attended the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all impeccably groomed, and the men are a real treasure trove".
Two estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, who were walking around the halls on a Sunday evening in evening dress, both claimed that they and their clients were millionaires.
"I'm looking at the cars and trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said young Yumatova, who was boastfully flitting around in her custom-designed clothes as if she had become accustomed to the hustle and bustle.
The fair is primarily designed for the new rich, the brand-oriented Russian shoppers who are willing to walk around a sprawling, cipher-studded venue after hours of traffic, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Mövenpick ice cream, regular pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund plüss ducks.
For the average person, the entrance fee is 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically sat in the booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, opposite a wall-size, hand-painted blue-ceramic copy of Rembrandt.
"Russians are more interested in the obvious".
Indeed, the salesmen here said that for a long time (by Russian standards, this was 10-15 years) rich Russians had already switched from flashy logos to trivial, limited-edition brands that would not fit on a trade fair.
Yet thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaire's heirs and tourists, filled the venue to capacity every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the bed manufacturer King Koil, said that he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold leather, for $70,000 each.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate of A1 Moto, a company that provides high-end cars with modern alarms, reported that his company sold a bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car company that provides customized solutions, sold three cooling grids to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon, which resemble connected chains, and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel he had made for a Russian casino owner, which he said was covered with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
A set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a strut-skin wheel and a picture of his wife's face made of a cube of zirconium will not necessarily use these objects", said Karapetian.
"Instead, he's gonna keep 30 or 40 cars in a guarded garage".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a privilege these days, given the surge in real estate prices there.
"Whoever bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago is now very likely to be a millionaire, if not in cash, at least on paper", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who are not millionaires can at least make a show of wealth at the booth of Alliance Continental, the Russian asset management company.
The company built four English-style telephone boxes, which were piled up with millions of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, told me that his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires' Bazaar.
Many of the visitors stopped to gamble, taking pictures with their cell phones of themselves in the money-laundering or pocketing a few million dollars.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", said Karryev.
Surgical malfunction is suspected in a New Jersey death.
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked out the window of the "Only a Little Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance pull up on Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
A police car arrived shortly after.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop", said Mr. Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"I knew someone was dead by then".
Authorities have identified the deceased as 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, a former executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
An investigation is underway to determine whether the death was caused by an unlicensed plastic surgeon working at 212 West Scott Avenue, who has not been identified by police.
Authorities have not yet been able to determine the cause of Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to high-ranking members of the Newark Police Department.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, had been working as an assistant to Police Commissioner Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, diligent and dependable", McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector".
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of former New York City police officer Jimmy Arroyo, who now works for the Cotton Control Board, and left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
A spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Eileen Walsh, Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators are working to determine whether Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon.
"The odds are high", Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing".
According to the authorities, they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
21st and Mrs. Arroyo found on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and the police have revealed very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if the detectives had interviewed Castro.
The study participants are investigating whether part of the house functioned as a medical prescription.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door to Castro's home, where a withered rose bush stood in the narrow front yard and a dalmatian roared from the back of the house.
Next to the basement door, in the driveway, there was a blue container marked "Ethyl Vanillin", which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hanging sideways from hooks.
McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the unusual and unusual political culture of the new city.
"He always said, 'You better watch this and that,'" she recalled.
"He was always there when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I left at night.
It was confusing".
Expectations for a Fed rate cut are leading to a global stock market crash .
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic skyrocketed yesterday after the vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of America's reassuring remarks raised hopes that the Fed will seek to ease investment options with further interest rate cuts.
Stock markets in London, New York and across Europe have rallied after Donald Kohn, the right-hand man of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, said that policymakers must respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the uncertainty in financial markets.
In addition to Kohn's clear aim of calming markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crisis, he stated that the current unrest "has partly reversed the market developments in late September and October".
He said that if the increased uncertainty continues, it could increase the possibility of further tightening of credit conditions for households and companies.
The comments were interpreted by investors as indicating that the Fed was prepared to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even to make further interest rate cuts in order to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements have also had a calming effect on Wall Street, which has recently been hit by several bad news stories about the U.S. economy, including the record number of homes sold in the U.S.
The collateral effect of financial turmoil was reinforced by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would be laying off 650 employees, or 4 percent of its global workforce, as part of cost-cutting to offset losses in the U.S. secondary mortgage sector.
The above measure affects a total of 20 jobs at the London headquarters, which employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 pounds to the value of Britain's blue-chip companies.
The German Dax rose by 2.6%, while the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
The credit market turmoil was renewed after the European Central Bank's high-demand auction sold three-month bonds to European banks at a 4.7% price, the highest since April 2001.
With the UK interbank rate, Libor, having risen steadily since 12 November to its highest level since September, 6.59%, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to provide additional capital to the London money market.
England to appeal Owais Shah's decision against Ravi Bopara
You've given me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should have the sixth position of the English team in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first Test against Sri Lanka, it is equally important who makes the decision.
The latter question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors, who is temporarily in charge of this particular task, is helping head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan with the decision, and because the desk of the English managing director, Hugh Morris, is beginning to fill with applications for the national selectorship, or at least for a one-off post.
The shorter of the two players will draw the one who does not get the sixth-string spot, but as we know, life, and especially sport, is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell what makes someone reach the top of their profession while someone else can't even reach the bottom, and it's often more a matter of luck than talent.
It is not just cricket that is difficult to select, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to step forward?
Is it fair to the Shah if this happens?
The same question can be asked in other areas of life, for example, if you put John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly educated, young business executives in front of decision makers, and there's only room for one of them.
Who can tell the level of a cricketer without being thrown into deep water in a serious competition?
Of course, data is a big part of decision-making, but equally important is choice.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's eye at the right moment at the cricket gate, and a batsman must be given a chance on a regular basis if he is to become a great player.
It's much more difficult to catch the scout's eye.
James Anderson, for example, has had more players than him last season, and he's a solid first-team player, even though Stephen Harmison says he's in good shape and can hit a lot of balls.
Anderson fought his way into the tournament with 32 first-class wicket hauls and 33 runs batted in.
Chris Tremlett only struck out 29, but both have had successful moments at the highest level and hope to have more in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided by the opinions.
This decision may make or break someone's career, but it may not have any particular impact on the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was the then-rising Paul Collingwood who rose to become the defining Test cricketer, perhaps still under-appreciated today despite scoring double hundred against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that in their meeting at the Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, in the light of their conservative instincts, will vote for the greater experience of the Shah, against the youthful vitality and dynamism of the Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
Shah made his brilliant and successful debut in the quarter-finals of the 88 Bombay Test against Bopara, who was seven years his junior, 22 years old, and who also excelled in the twist and the drum, scoring 32 first-class centuries.
But the fact that Middlesex player Shah only ran ten in the two-quarter test against the West Indies at home Lorda in May, and the fact that Vaughan, who was struggling to get back in the game, was met with immediate opposition from the selectors, seems to have reduced the stamina that was still evident in Bombay.
Compared to Essex's all-round talent, he's a lively and unrivaled player.
There's nothing to be ashamed of on the cricket pitch, but off the field, his behavior was well described when he overturned a four-wheel drive car of the team's automobile sponsor, Volkswagen, at an exhibition.
He suffered minor injuries and was presumably shocked, but the first thing he did afterwards was to pick up his Vodafone (which was sponsored by the company) and call his teammate, Alastair Cook, who was watching him from afar, and ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a classically improved midfielder, with a sliding mid-range move that gives him a good shot, and a confident and skillful bat.
It's one thing to choose the right person, and another to choose the right moment.
Maybe that's the art of selection.
I would personally give Bopara a chance now, which is not to say that I don't think Shah would be a good choice if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one playing this weekend.
Buses are transporting refugees back to work and fight al-Qaeda.
Yesterday, the first buses arrived in Baghdad from Syria, carrying Iraqi refugees who had run out of money, who had expired visas, or who were hoping to restore order to the city.
Some of them have returned to fight the soldiers who drove them from their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already packed with Syrian and Jordanian refugees returning home before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus arrived, packed with dozens of buses.
"I then decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", said Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he added, referring to the militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently stopping the Shiite army.
A 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni city of Amariyah, Qassim al Atwani, returned home with two of his children after failing to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking up jobs.
Amari's ski neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying that American-backed troops had successfully pushed al-Qaeda out of their stronghold in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shia tribal leader who fled a bombing from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, after he began to encourage his citizens to fight against Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had formed an anti-al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and needed my support and that of my sons.
That's why I came back today", said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the peace that has been consolidated in the capital since the withdrawal of American troops and the appeal of civilian armed forces working with the Americans.
But even more were forced to return home from Damascus because of visa and material problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a mother of three, echoed a widely held view among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had asked the Syrian government to deny the refugees' visas in order to force their return.
It is estimated that over two and a half million have fled the country's death squads.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and put pressure on the government not to issue more visas to Iraqis so that they could immigrate", said the Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I fled".
One of the reasons for the easing of violence was the expulsion of Sunnis from Shiite areas, while Shiites also left Sunni areas, which resulted in a reduction in tension in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden arrival of refugees will stir up the mood again, perhaps even leading to new fighting.
Small Saar Region - training in the plain
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and its higher education is internationally oriented.
In just one training area, the people of the Saar struggle with the same deficiencies as the rest of the country.
"Today I explained to a non-French person from the Saar region for the 50th time that we are not French", is the self-ironic slogan on the posters for the 50th anniversary of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saar region, which according to the surveys of the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne, is ranked fifth.
In this way, higher education institutions - even if only because of traditions - cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can still complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
Accordingly, your 15.6% is a high proportion of foreign students.
However, the Saarland's colleges and universities are also more attractive than average for those who wish to study in the Saar - many of whom do not have a high school diploma.
"The Saar region is taking advantage of the opportunities of vocational training", explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Economic Institute.
More than one in five young people are enrolled in vocational schools, with the Saar region exceeding the federal average by more than seven per cent.
The possibilities for combining vocational and higher education training are well developed.
The infrastructure for dual studies is the second largest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite the practice-oriented training and the growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Saar Ministry of Education has therefore ordered the higher education institutions to carry out a marketing campaign focusing on engineering.
"We have initiated a number of reforms in primary schools following the first Pisa study", a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education said.
So the government has instituted nationwide comparative tests.
To get kids to start school early, the last year of kindergarten is free, and that's a model that other states have started to emulate.
Whether the students' performance improves permanently will only be answered in future comparative studies.
The 2003 Pisa survey showed that the proportion of students at risk had fallen from 29 to 20 percent.
The Saarland's overall performance was not, however, improved to the same extent as that of the other federal states.
Bavarians are better at counting.
To the great annoyance of the Saar-Velhi, the Pisa census does not take into account the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, this area could be harvested in a different way.
The language of the neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in secondary schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chavez is resetting the clocks.
In Venezuela, the clocks will be different from the rest of the world for the foreseeable future.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chavez will roll back the clock for half an hour in the Latin American country.
Meanwhile, Chávez became the laughingstock of Spain.
As Venezuela's official newspaper reported, a new law will turn back clocks to four and a half hours behind Greenwich Mean Time.
In this way, the South American country will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
One of the reasons given by the anti-American Chávez for his decision was that the United States had forced the world to use time zones based on whole hours.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday (local time) that he was cutting ties with neighboring Colombia over a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the President of Colombia, he has no contact with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this for the sake of my dignity", said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that will be voted on by the citizens of the oil-rich country in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly increase his power in the country.
The controversy was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chavez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe's decision to "arcul spit" Venezuela was a direct criticism of Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile-phone jingle has been heard in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), a phrase that has been downloaded by more than half a million people.
The phrase comes from Juan Carlos, King of Spain, who at the recent Latin America summit was so incensed by the constant rantings of the left-wing populist politician that he cut it off.
In 2007, Germans are threatened by wage cuts
A forecast says that German workers will face a decline in real wages this year despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have given a host of reasons for their pessimistic forecasts.
The Hans-Bröckler-Stiftung has calculated that in 2007 employees may actually expect to receive less than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage growth, the increase in the general sales tax and the rapid rise in food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research to the German daily Bild.
Unemployment insurance can also place additional burdens on employees.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stated in a statement to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that in the current situation it is right and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Employment Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to turn to the federation for loans or subsidies, a politician from the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD, was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the explosion in food and petroleum prices has led to the highest inflation in 13 years.
In a year-on-year comparison, prices increased by a total of 3%.
Venus is Earth's evil twin
Despite its harsh atmosphere, Venus is more like Earth than previously thought. In its orbit, the European spacecraft Venus Express detected lightning bolts and in its polar circles winds similar to those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is struck by lightning.
Europe's Venus Express spacecraft has provided evidence of electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus travels from cloud to cloud at 56 kilometres (35 miles) altitude, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the journal Nature.
The famous "soup theory" of the origin of life on Earth is that lightning caused the storms to initiate reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been in the very early ages", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
At present, there can be little life on the surface of Venus, its atmosphere being 100 times denser than Earth's, and temperatures sometimes reaching 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the Earth's infernal twin, but it's still her twin", Russel pointed out.
The main question of the ESA mission is why Venus, so similar to Earth in mass and size, is on a completely different evolutionary path.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a landmark in the quest for Venus, because no probe had been on a mission to explore this planet since the early 1990s.
The latest findings, reported in several Nature articles, are not just proof of the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system, the researchers say.
"They also indicate that the neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than originally thought", Esa said.
In addition to the well-known northern polar vortex, researchers have discovered an even faster moving cloud vortex at the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the winter hemisphere of the Earth, says a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica in Italy.
The second-most innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth, and at 7,500 miles [12,100 km] in diameter, it is almost as large as Earth.
The Evening Star, as it is also called, takes just 225 days to circle the Sun.
However, it orbits its own disk much more slowly: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus' surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius, coupled with a pressure of 92 bars, is hardly Earthlike, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Both of them had water accumulated on them, which remained as an ocean on Earth, while Venus was expelled into space.
And while on Earth, carbon dioxide is bound up in carbonate rocks, on Venus, it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Köhler, demands an end to the dispute between the parties which has arisen over the Dalai Lama's acceptance as Chancellor.
He indirectly criticised the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September election.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's prestige and has called on the grand coalition to end the debate over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not be seen as a divided nation on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
Köhler also expressed his understanding for the fact that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) hosted the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights are universal for me, even if I respect the differences between cultures", Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must maintain a delicate balance in foreign policy, the President of the Republic stressed; however, Merkel defended herself against the accusation that the Chancellor was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not broken with the traditional 'one China' policy.
China is aware of this", Köhler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German Foreign Minister (SPD), has indirectly expressed his displeasure with the Dalai Lama's reception and has therefore become a target of attacks in the ranks of the Union.
The Commission's proposal is to be implemented by the end of the year.
After the Dalai Lama's reception in the Chancellery, there was a great deal of unrest in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only rejected the invitation of the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries' Foreign Ministries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to host the Dalai Lama.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the Tibetan religious leader in their official capacity, as confirmed by Chinese President Wen Jiabao.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words suggest that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan territories from China, including other modern provinces.
Schäuble warns of unrest like the one in France
Street clashes with the police, shootings, car fires: Wolfgang Schäuble is wary of riots like the one in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from turning into street violence, demands the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades are being set on fire, rioters are firing sniper rifles at police: Following the serious riots by young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior (CDU) Wolfgang Schäuble fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must ensure that social explosives do not accumulate in our society and do not degenerate into violence.
We have to take it seriously", he told the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not all youths adjust to the rapid changes in social reality.
The federation, provinces and communities are working intensively to resolve the problematic cases, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes are already visible".
But it's too soon to resolve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble referred to the fact that German suburbs do not have the urban architectural and sociological problems that France has.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have been fighting police in the streets for the past few nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were set on fire.
In view of this, the head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Mr Kenan Kolat, called on the Federal Government to take greater action on integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "danger of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But action is required.
Kolat referred to the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families as "higher than average".
First of all, more educational places should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective".
However, the Turkish Community leader added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
And many young people from immigrant families don't want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat warns: "We must be on our guard".
Young people "should be given the opportunity to work and to study as soon as possible".
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, the night was quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were on call, a helicopter with headlights circling the area.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and some burning garbage cans and authors.
Since the report, a security detail of 1,000 men has been on duty.
Police are prepared to intervene as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, 80 police officers were injured in the Villiers-le-Bel riot.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were sparked by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
The prosecution's initial findings are that the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young men.
In the realm of the cloud-shaker Angela
The chancellor's recklessness is proof that the coalition is dead and that nothing can be expected of him.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor live in?
Following his bleak, indifferent and meaningless speech in the Bundestag's general debate, it must be stated that he does not live here - nor in the country whose governance he is responsible for.
Angela Merkel flatly refuted the charge that she was too focused on foreign policy.
It's provincial, he said, and it's just a way of saying he doesn't want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federation meeting, he made it clear to everyone how much blame is being laid at the door.
Meanwhile, there was no real interest or empathy for the country's problems.
Instead, we have Angela the Skywalker, a politician who has escaped reality, who has fled into foreign policy and is left with the uncertainty of his own.
Example of climate protection: He unrestrainedly praises himself for the Heiligendamm Resolutions, but he is silent about how the country should achieve climate goals.
In general, as far as self-praise goes, the CDU chairwoman would not have allowed herself such an act of immodesty two years ago.
Now he's clinging to the phrase that prosperity makes a positive impact on people.
This has damaged his reputation as a pragmatic person who offers solutions to problems instead of rhetoric.
But in the kingdom of Angela's rising, domestic problems are only a side issue.
Child poverty and the problems of low-income people?
It's only worth a few half-sentences.
The frequency of language errors in family replacement is telling in this regard.
Merkel has to be three times to come up with a half-way-clean sentence.
If it's about specifics, he's trespassing in foreign territory.
The Department of the Attorney General
The Republican presidential candidates have been engaged in a bitter battle of wits between the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, in a YouTube debate, and now they're wary of an outsider.
The candidates' tension has already surfaced over the first issue.
Mitt Romney is accusing his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of making New York City "a haven for illegal immigrants".
Contrasting this with the hard facts: "I would say that his own house was used as a refuge for illegal immigrants", retorts Giuliani, who also blames the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants as private individuals.
The candidates are rushing to the polls: With the Republican camp still without a unified favorite, the eight presidential hopefuls are using the debate on CNN as a way to undermine their opponent's credibility.
The 30-second videos that users upload to YouTube are little more than short summaries.
"This is the kind of isolationism that got Hitler to power", John McCain says under the nose of his running mate, Ron Paul, who is the only one of the panelists to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also being washed by a Vietnam veteran who is reluctant to condemn what is known as "waterboarding", a form of interrogation that simulates drowning.
That the campaign's important issues are, however, beyond the debate over Iraq and torture, is shown by the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
There's a lot of applause in the room for the conservative values and the rejection of future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
"I was wrong then", Romney said, and he apologized to his supporters and television viewers for voting for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, nods when asked about his literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf's first civilian government
A day after the withdrawal of the army, Musharraf, who was in power in Pakistan, was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The oath of office for President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf for another five years was administered on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to uphold the constitution and to act in the best interests of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over the military leadership to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus succumbed to international pressure, primarily from the United States.
After eight years of bloodless military coups, the former general is now ruling as a civilian head of state for the first time.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf has met a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency which Musharraf had declared on November 3rd.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency shortly after taking the oath, thereby fulfilling another demand of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf seated lawyers who sympathized with him in early November after declaring a state of emergency, last week rejected any protest over the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal area of North Waziristan, an attack on a military convoy killed five soldiers and wounded four others.
According to a military spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The fathers of krautrock are back
The German supergroup of the 1970s was back in the music scene, with three members of the band Harmonia playing their instruments to the beat of a concert in Berlin.
The reunion will feature a cut from their "Live 1974" heyday.
They were already well known abroad at that time.
The sensation announced was the three gentlemen surrounding the dinner table.
Each with its own instrument, its own cable, and each with its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, in the middle, in a snow-white shirt.
Michael Rother, 57, on the left, is a young man with a laptop and a guitar.
Looking over the audience, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius on the right is stunned and concentrates on the console.
Each one produces a noise of some kind, and occasionally a rhythm.
And all of that, sometimes, almost by accident, is combined with traditional music.
But this does not seem to bother you.
It was a great thrill for the fans of the krautrock music direction that the Harmonia band was back in the music.
What we can tell you is that, as a result of proper investigation, we can conclude that the name has pervaded the collective memory of the band, but in no way has it left such a lasting imprint that we will miss this band sorely after 32 years.
But why shouldn't I celebrate the living legends of the Germans in their 70s?
Especially because what we misleadingly call krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in its home country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for lifetime achievement to the surviving members of the Cologne band Can in 2003, German pop icons sat in the room with a puzzled face.
When he thanked the Red Hot Chili Peppers and La Düsseldorf and Neu! for their support, the surprise was boundless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother, an old friend of his, would sit on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Rejection at home and acceptance abroad are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is already overwhelmed by the Harmony, because the trio existed for only two years, and in that time had a far smaller impact than what others later attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously worked with Conrad Schnitzler as artists under the promising name Cluster.
They played in the basement of the Schaubühne Theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a record company financed by the church.
Rother briefly joined Kraftwerk, and in parallel gained a reputation as the guitarist of perhaps the most radical German band at the time, Neu!.
However, around 1973, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in the Forest of Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rom lived as a commune that had fled the city.
Less ideologically than in the I. Commune, where Roedelius was still a baby-sitter.
Their lives are more like idyllic artistic lives.
Apparently, the flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir was found in the trash and that's how they got their name for their art.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next one is called "De Luxe".
Despite its relaxed and modest music, the group was in financial need.
The gathering of the relics alone did not ensure their finding.
The CD, released as Live 1974, was recorded at a concert in Gresham, in front of a record-breaking crowd of just under 50, so you remember.
The Harmony Effort and the occasional practice were Rother's ideas back then.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced their breakup in 1975.
Rother was stuck in the esoteric and supported himself with albums like Flammende Herzen.
Cluster was revived in the '80s, which has since become more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album from the Griessem is a tribute to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record label, Greenland, set out to nurture krautrock as a distinctive German adjunct to live music.
Neu! was already being performed in the same way as Roedelius's solo work.
The Harmony revival will be held at the Berlin House of Culture.
It's a public fundraiser, part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the British originator of the Krautrock Sampler, is also present.
Also in attendance is the creator of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
All of this roughly outlines the influence of krautrock on the subsequent pop music era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills the void reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's statement, along with the most unusual sounds, floats through the room: "The only true music is the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in a room in a farmhouse.
The projection of additional black and white photographs of the Kusza wiring equipment serves to build the legend.
In the lobby, the three veterans are busy improvising again.
This is simply the attachment of microphones to the organ and drum kit with the intention of eliciting from the instruments unheard sounds by means of instruments that produce sound effects of their own making.
Today, electronic music is seen as electronic music.
Three, tech-savvy and a master builder.
Even the chorus doesn't change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and snore, and in a beautiful part, they sing "Aaaaaaaah!" with feeling.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Roots were sought less in the blues than in the music-arts colleges (Can), the technical know-how (Kraftwerk), or the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts "68!" they're not entirely on the wrong track, and that's why Harmonia is not letting themselves get off their feet.
Even the most obvious thing gets thought through on stage.
Where does the music begin and end?
It can make a man nervous, or it can make him forget his moments of exceptional good fortune.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
Through "Versage" and "Mörderischer Frieden" two films are repeatedly dealing with the Balkan war.
But none of them are convincing.
The basic thought is either too action-oriented and shooting or too emotional.
Not even Richard Gere can help you with that in "The Walking Dead".
First, the good news: although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it is there, in the dark background of the Bosnian war, that they have found the actor Richard Gere again.
We've been losing sight of the most handsome man of the '80s lately, because his many good-guy, no-say-something roles in women's-oriented films and his many press conferences on Buddhism have taken our mood to dance.
And suddenly Richard Gere is the most compelling reason to watch The Wedding.
It's a wonderful, smiling portrayal: essentially, the war correspondent Simon Hunt is what Gere would have become if fate and the film industry had not been so kind to him: a man who has long since left behind his best years, but whose romance-like memories of his decline have retained much of his former charm.
But the film "The Betrayal" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also began screening this week, continue the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" is a film about two German soldiers (Adrian Topol and Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film, which is shallow in the TV movies, is lost too quickly in the shooting and the action.
It carries the "Cobra 11" badge - war instead of highway.
On the other hand, it is in the case of "The Betrayal" that one can see why not a single really good film has been made about the Balkan war.
The story of three US war correspondents who set out to investigate the Serbian war criminal known as "Roja", with a different director, a different screenwriter (both in the persona of Richard Shepard) could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" story in another era.
The stories have a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups cut down the forest to do what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the journey to madness is complete.
One of the reasons why The Opposition failed is that it simply doesn't allow Simon Hunt to be the down-and-out cynic that he is at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he's even romantically linked to a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The "Vengeance" is finally slipping away when reporters in the last five minutes of the film, in the form of fast-paced footage, achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Moslems for just retribution.
It's so bad that the only thing one would want to do is go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for the crime against the logic of cinema.
But the film's purpose is deeply human.
He intends to make a mockery of Karadzic and Mladic's continued freedom, and to accuse the Americans and the French (who are still exceptionally united) of not pursuing the persecution with sufficient intensity because of their secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that one is reminded of a famous Brecht poem.
In it, the poet writes of the Asian demon on his desk: "I gaze with compassion at the power that is born, that reveals how tiresome it is to be bad".
Films like "The Opposition" have similarly oversized, human-headed masks, but they show how tiresome it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan wars.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were a dismal failure.
And to add: There hasn't been a single good movie about South Africa.
Almost always, when a star walks through the world's crisis zones or minefields, it's like "The Paths of Liberty" with Patricia Arquette, "Without a Threat" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamond" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in time.
It took decades for Hollywood to make a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Probably some films still do - for the Vietnam War classics such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jacket" were not universally celebrated as masterpieces in their day.
But it's possible that nowadays, when every mass murder is being broadcast live on two screens, we're just learning too much about the world's conflicts.
And that deprives the screenwriters of the ignorance of reality that is necessary to tell good stories.
After all, "To Be or Not to Be" and "The Dictator" were so successful because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you shouldn't strive for good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we should adopt the sarcastically distant artistic view of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprière Lexicon" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because certain things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in horrible ways, and war will always be the rule in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is under fire for his decision to cancel the Olympics.
The mayor's departure from Hamburg's bid to host the Summer Olympics has sparked fierce criticism in political and economic circles.
Many people want to continue fighting for the water games.
But Von Beus, in his speculation, is a strong warning of the realities.
The director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described the withdrawal as "unfavourable for the economic environment".
No other project has unleashed such a powerful motivational force in the city in recent times as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, we would not be able to maintain the momentum of sports politics in a steady way".
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "that starts with modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust has maintained his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are not realistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
Referred to the decision of the Sports Confederation expected at the beginning of December on the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
"The preference given to this means that we have no realistic chance of winning in the period up to 2028 that we have been thinking about".
But we are not giving up on the dream, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) has expressed its regret over von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg has no intention of bidding for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to throw away an opportunity by burying our plans now", said HSB president Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
Moreover, the withdrawal of the application is contrary to the statement of the President of the Senate at the General Meeting of the German College Sports Association.
The Commission therefore considers that the aid in question is compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107 (3) (c) of the Treaty.
The College Sports Association only last week launched Hamburg as a bidder.
The SPD's civil society group has complained to the Senate that it has wasted valuable time on the construction of Hamburg's housing.
"The Senate has been delaying the development of Kleiner Grasbrook for years because it voted for the Olympics and did not vote for housing", said two SPD lawmakers, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to push for the integrated plan for the Olympic and subsequent residential development of Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally focused on the 'event factor'.
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused great excitement in Hamburg at the time.
However, he failed to make it to the Hamburg Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
If you think of Sweden and Fallada as being connected, you're thinking of Ike and not Andy Warhol.
Or did you?
At present, Swedish-made wall boxes cast a dark shadow over Warhol's catalog of works.
The 94 'Stockholm type' Brillo Boxes listed here are mostly forged.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen had questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Box a few months earlier, an internal investigation by the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come up with a sobering result: A copy of the six "Brillo Boxes" donated to the Moderna Museet by former museum director Pontus Hultén in 1995 - and most likely a hundred more "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxes in circulation internationally.
The back story is a long and complicated, bewildering chain of artistic and curatorial antics.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxait" in New York in 1964 - painted wallpapers based on the red-blue-white pattern of the "Brillo" soapbox.
At a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were displayed: These were not (for cost-saving reasons) from Warhol, but were shipped directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It wasn't about art, it was about patterns, simple exhibits.
However, Warhol granted permission in 1968 for some Brillo bottles to be made in Sweden, but these were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the era now speak of fifteen boxes that, as authenticated Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes at the time, rightfully entered the history of art and auction under the designation "Stockholm type".
Some of them have sold for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred boxes were produced and displayed in Sweden on wheels, which he then left to Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not made until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, as well as three boxes in Swedish private ownership, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968. The pressed rotating boards were first laid down and polished, then the white oil paint was brushed up.
However, the structure of the copies from 1990 shows that the paint was applied directly to the rotary board by means of a paint roller without a base - and it is not oil paint but acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authenticated by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes", says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet. "The Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York will not decide otherwise, and the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibiting material".
Of course, the Authentication Board announced back in June that it was investigating soapbox cases for "serious charges".
Since then, however, they have been cloaked in implacable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila surrender
The rebellion in the Philippines was started by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, said the hotel's manager, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, the hotel was raided by government soldiers using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricaded in the building for hours.
Half the team were in court Thursday for the failed coup attempt of 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly turn on 30 sympathizers.
The military police assigned to guard the man apparently switched sides and joined the riot.
They infiltrated the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government-run units have sealed off the area around the luxury hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
Security advisor Norberto Gonzales has condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"They have enough for the people", said Trillanes.
"We call on the people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, former commander of the elite Scout Rangers, said other units of the army were planning to join the march soon.
Government critics called for a massive protest against the president on Friday.
His administration has been plagued by corruption allegations for months.
The financial district of Manila was the main site of a 2003 attempted mutiny against Arroyo by 200 members of the military.
The uprising collapsed after less than 24 hours, as the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet is going to be a major shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet has secured a holding of more than 20% in the telecommunications company Versatel.
As the company announced on Wednesday night, the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
That's 20.05% of his share capital.
There was speculation about the takeover even before this.
The possibility of increasing the ownership stake acquired in Versatel remains open.
The move is aimed at helping to consolidate the German DSL market, United Internet said.
On Wednesday, speculation about a possible merger had already been raised, as Berenberg Bank increased its existing stake in the Dusseldorf network provider by 5% to 15,1%.
The bank only holds the stake for a third party, it's said on the money market.
The day before, United Internet had just a 10 percent stake in Drillisch, the mobile phone company.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch issued 17,4 million new shares for EUR 106,4 million.
United Internet bought 5,15 million shares of this stock for EUR 31,4 million.
In addition, the companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation in the market launch of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", said a spokesman for United-Internet.
The two companies jointly established the MSP joint venture with the aim of acquiring the competitor Freenet.
The two companies will initially be satisfied with a 10% stake in Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over a further 18.49% stake in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies are leaving all options open, especially with regard to the increase in their stake in Freenet AG, the news says.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game that has been going on for months around Freenet, and which is only now becoming more and more obvious, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2,9 million contract mobile customers and 1,27 million DSL and fixed-line customers.
United Internet and the holding company formed by Drillisch had a direct stake of 6,01% in Freenet.
Now it's been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another round of four percent.
An agreement on the right to purchase 18,49% of Vatas Investment Company was concluded in August.
