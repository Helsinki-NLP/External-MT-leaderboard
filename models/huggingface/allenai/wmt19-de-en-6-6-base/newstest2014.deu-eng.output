Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall light.
Two plants so close together: intention or tortoise?
This question was answered clearly yesterday by the Mayor of Berlin.
"The Rathausampel was installed at that time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light ensures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › Grub ‹.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, a further traffic light was necessary for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily, of which about ten percent are heavy traffic," Arnold emphasises.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety simply proceeds here", so Arnold.
A total of four traffic inspections had been carried out, a roundabout was also planned, however, because of the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße again discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was tested in the selection of the traffic lights before: "Using an especially for us with particularly long wooden logs loaded transporter we tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without bend the traffic lights".
The traffic light system, which costs around 15,000 euros, is the "most modern thing on the market", Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so vigorously that the lights of the drivers, for example, can be easily recognized even when the sun is low.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new only eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"Should a group or handicapped people cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will safely cross the road," Arnold explained.
Of course the driver has to think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly did the traffic lights show green for pedestrians, a top class vehicle rushing through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The book winner is known primarily as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze" (Weather lights on the tip of the tongue), which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz, Collage Gerhard Fresacher therefore composes a collage of prose texts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiaturen from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which the idea is copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble clings through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70 minute performance transforms the original with an abundance of directing ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Particularly the actresses are involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic realizations.
They are hard touched, submerged with the head under water, stacked to the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stack on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this strenuous way.
The best moments are the evening when it is sung - the range ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
It is only towards the end that the overturned performance comes to rest, and Winkler ’ s downright absurd humor flashes up.
A blackbox in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits into the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every kilometer travelled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing US American roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined forces with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled - and possibly also where they were driven - and of using the information to calculate tax rulings.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay for each mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It ’ s nothing we just might use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes paid by US Americans at the pump, is bankrupt.
But America is no longer fueled as much as it used to.
Cars consume less fuel.
The national oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent at high fuel prices.
"The fuel tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, for the tax could, for example, be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious statutory goals of the federal state on climate change.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also fond of the idea of having drivers pay after the distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice President of Reason Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move towards mile-based settlement.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move and thus responded to the concerns of parliamentarians from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or town in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Most committed is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 riders for the country ’ s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the First 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could pursue any of its movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Nevada Department of Transport.
People did not want it.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full-fledged surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometres travelled, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, according to Khan, the public would also be calmer.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states with the taxation of drivers.
On the contrary, their aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the mileage they have travelled.
But the devices she has tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving car drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles travelled by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance to be paid only for kilometres driven, and speed data from other vehicles to be collected in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Drivers are motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the territory of San Francisco Bay, officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation when an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats wacker
The volunteer fire brigade coped their main test with flying colours despite lack of personnel.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise acceptance.
There should have been a short circuit when sawing.
Due to the arising fire and the smoke development two people were injured, one of them could send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the weir prepared to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and to guide him into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored much wood and also straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first fire attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an overfloor hydrant at a distance of about 100 metres.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
During the exercise, Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what is to be accomplished with few staff available.
In case of emergency, support is provided via the Königsfeld daily operation group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the county of Breisgau and Hochschwarzwald, Landtagspräsident Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee and Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow came from.
Together with the managing directors of the professional schools as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the parents advisory board chairmen, he pursued this important question at the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation in the forests town between the funding centre, the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important to look not only at the family phase, but also at the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also stated that more and more employees were taking care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already known the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills often remain the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region", the President of the Regional Assembly expressed his conviction.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for skilled workers could also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its favourable position in the south-west of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
Furthermore, on his train journey from Titisee to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made for the development of local public transport.
"Continue to remain persistent and ensure that public transport improves," he said to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
Formerly the older fellow citizens were entertained in the resting place.
Meanwhile this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße before the refurbishment is to be set again on the refurbishment cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the kilbig, a small angular wall was installed for stabilization and static relief of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade during the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure envisages incorporating the Landesdenkmalamt into the planning and establishing a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation shall be carried out by experts, who shall then be put on the table of the municipal council for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
This is expected to be decided next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future as a follow-up, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and placed on new substructure.
The historic, one hundred year-old wall of the old schoolyard to the church road, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since no drainage is available, needs renovation and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not at present at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done by the current fastening work.
Originally, the refurbishment of the school was even planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unscheduled expenditure resulted in a postponement.
An important word in the historical restoration of the school walls, which was even used for filming, will be shared by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If the guidelines come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the conservationists.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Green Party, has joined the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the Jazzstandort Stuttgart.
Thus Özdemir, who is regarded in Stuttgart as the favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, contradicts the Green Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is pushing for a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden Württemberg.
The program Jazz and Pop will then be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and an aeration system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the data, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig through under the radar," said Laura Duffy, Attorney General of Southern California District, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Addressing the drug-gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue building such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US and the Mexican security forces are fighting the drug cartels for a period of time.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that he was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration to the US.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was seized because of the seizure of marijuana.
All three are threatened with life imprisonment as a maximum penalty, as officials have said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, according to the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.
They would do everything they can to get to the US.
There were no details about the detainees; at least one was Mexican.
They have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 is Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the town of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first written mention is coming closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the anniversary year is due.
Geisingen and churches were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official prelude to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event takes place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time in churches.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in churches in Hausen.
In July, the churches of Hausen will celebrate the 1250 on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
This festive weekend is also the churches of the Hausener Kirchenfest.
Municipal Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sonnwendfeier of the Black Forest Club, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle.
This is finished and inaugurated in the Jubilee Year, the official date is on the last September weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary a new chronicle will be published.
"But a chronicle should not only be of Geisingen himself, but also a printed work about today's Geisingen, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen and Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today ’ s Geisingen celebrates its birthday in 2014. In 1974, today ’ s space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
On 8 February, Strohglonki begins with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the regional music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this during the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (Hausen), which was then a court of justice.
Both congregations are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250 year old accordingly, in addition the municipal form is 40 years back.
Council targets track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
He has to take 220 000 euros into his hand.
The Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
Particularly the safety at level crossings is to be increased - regularly it comes nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute with one third to the costs, the rest are shared by the railways and the federal government.
Shield's master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the "Am Hirschen" rail crossing to the municipal council.
There the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting long-timber, could also be in reverse traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the following road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for street distribution: Thomas Kipp summed up the critics' mood with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" was regularly used for long timber transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route served as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Given that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels had to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am" Hirschen "could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have the costs of widening the street.
Notwithstanding this, the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing with the provision that the necessary retaining wall should be built in such a way that the city could, if necessary, extend the following road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to about 5.5 metres for meeting traffic.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had examined the conversion plans of the railway from the Breinlinger engineering office, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser trail was possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting up.
The responsibility for this, in turn, is borne by the city as a road builder.
The conversion could result in liability disputes.
As both the timber removal and the bending in the current state of development worked, one should not agree with the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition was significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because right next to it there is the central stop, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the central station would have to be braked at this point so far that no collision threatens.
The majority of people refused to approve the reconstruction of this railway crossing, as the city had to "bathe out" the problem with seated vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction works had been completed.
The committee considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" as unproblematic, for which intersection agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now need to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years.
30 suggestions were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
Nobody knows if there are at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: Should you search for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover alien life?
These are precisely the questions that the European Space Agency Esa is asking.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects, which should make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such "L 'missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas have been debated, five of them have now come to a closer election.
Numerous bodies review the proposals and follow the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions were selected by Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 initiated program "Cosmic Vision" should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets that orbit these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined in more detail in our surroundings.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be indicative of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on what conditions exist for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplarily.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose Esa provides the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under whose roof all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe arise and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is Dark Matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and Dark Energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M mission, the start of which is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chances for a permit as L ´ mission is "E ´ Lisa", a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
This means physicists changing the structure of space-time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been detected until today.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission includes a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
Contrary to plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that arose during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals still compete for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes among other things, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Already excreted are, among other things, proposals for samples for the return transport from Mars, for the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany regarding US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US secret service, has stated that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify to the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
On Thursday, the German deputy Hans Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which Ströbele presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a treachery and tries to criminalize political expression with threat of punishment, in which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge brought by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior HansPeter Friedrich said online about Zeit: "If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for secret services, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US".
Ströbele, a Green MEP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Ströbele said that, according to former NSA attorney Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden said in Germany, he needed an assurance that he was' safe 'there, the MEP said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw himself exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had expelled him from his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians - including in the United States - have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit for the general public.
In his letter Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines charges charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars from passengers who wish to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for one piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it would charge 25 US dollars if the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travelers to take care of payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to charge charges for the first and second pieces of baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less with you on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of luggage free of charge at the Frontier gate, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley said that the Frontier website and the check procedure were changed so that passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the boarding gate.
Frontier's new hand baggage fee will only enter into force in summer, but there is still no exact date.
Passengers often abuse luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to use them.
They argue that transportation of luggage should cost money and that passengers should pay for this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them have so far left their fingers on hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested three years ago as the first charge for hand baggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost aircraft.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline's advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit annually contributes US $50 million.
Sorensen, who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see teeth crunching and tangible discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding ran as lubricated."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had tried for a short time to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but it reverted seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontier ’ s move to charge hand baggage charges if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at guiding customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of using an online travel agency.
Frontier has, however, gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company started to award half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut once again to 25 percent of the route.
A third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only earn customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively when buying directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women attended the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the Protestant congregation in Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the congregation house was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Redemptions from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the parish council, addressed the biblical proverbs in a lecture.
"Proverbs contain wisdom, rules, or warnings," she said.
She compared several proverbs with the relevant Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: "Wooden eyes be vigilant, as scales fall from the eyes, an eye cast on someone whom the Lord gives in his sleep, and his hands wash in innocence."
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners what proverb it was.
The church councillor Christel Dehner took on medieval phrases: all good things are three, blue, a little hidden.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges into the past".
At the end a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
The town hall candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed among the guests of the breakfast round.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry started on the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified as experts for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"What is new is that the six-month courses with qualifications end," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits were manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) in Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the site's crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that an error had paralyzed their public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evenings, the online server and trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that this is still not available for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
According to the speaker, secret information is not in danger.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA ’ s website with a DDoS offensive.
With such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly supersecret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No Such Authority), now finds itself in the bright light of the public and finds itself subjected to harsh criticism after the revelations about its extensive surveillance program in Germany and abroad, which have become known in recent months – a result of the secret NSA ’ s data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA co-worker Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over intelligence fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without a job dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1% better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder, deputy head of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Numerous companies have so far reacted in attitude.
One reason for this is according to Felder and Bauer: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the craft, health care and care for the elderly".
Since September, vacancies for staff in the hotel and catering industry have also started.
Mid-December the winter season begins there.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt from 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Victory losses at Bombardier after decrease in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decline in net profit on Thursday following pressure from declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway division.
Bombardier, headquartered in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in line with the ambitious schedule next September.
On the maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, only three more launches followed so far, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday with a view to the stock having a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft range will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, binding orders for the 177 CSeries are moderate to date, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential for the new jet aircraft are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call and added that during the service life of the aircraft ground tests and software updates had been scheduled.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to make a first flight and then to add a revision period, which we have also done.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, according to the company.
However, analysts remain sceptical as to whether the first customer will be able to operate a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it would review the commissioning plan (EIS) and update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if it seems to correspond to Bombardier's internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning is postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share, respectively, from 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remain at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly and fell from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September, unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this division rose by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport division amounted to 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September, slightly increasing compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new benchmarks for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon of Thursday ’ s trading, Bombardier declined share by 8.5 percent and amounted to 4.83 Canadian dollars, after Google ’ s Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette was also announced to join the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world ’ s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bomber ’ s closest rival, reported a ten-percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
One unknown fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at LAX ’ s airport.
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
The media also reported several casualties.
US President Barack Obama will be kept informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses stated that they had seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveller told CNN station that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and cried children.
Panic broke out among those waiting, many hiding behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveller of the "Los Angeles Times".
An employee of the TSA Security Agency suffered a shot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a film".
After that he himself had been brought into a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport-evacuated buildings
On television pictures, many ambulances and police cars were driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought to safety from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As reported by the airport management on Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, resulted in a long return.
Until landings, air traffic had been temporarily stopped, it was said.
However, several pilots were also seen on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles airport is one of the largest airports in the USA.
Cocaine dependent lawyer, who warned drug boss against police investigation, must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied subworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer nicknamed "Bash", praised by criminalists as "first-class", was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police supervised Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three sachets of cocaine at the House of the Bar in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the Bar Chamber.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, wallet and credit card tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police ensured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and 200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicized.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts for obstructing the judiciary.
He admitted the possession of cocaine in a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out during their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta ’ s house and put the drugs under the lawyer ’ s garbage bin with a 60% purity in a black glove.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta, who was at dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Wolves in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, fetched the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine, after tests had detected Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to the "lawyer's secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were assured and he was taken a hair sample.
During police interrogation, he stated that he was operating an office both at his private address and at work, and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court it became known that he had called important actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and had informed about what investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken."
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, superintendent Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and is trying to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial obstruction, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years in total for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer; his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and equal opportunities were the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160 years of existence, the Dunningen lieder wreath will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which enthused the audience this spring, the song wreath will enrich two services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be held from 19 a.m. during the evening Mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des heiliges Opfer der Messe", D 872, is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost regarded as revolutionary at the time of its birth.
The Mass is performed in the context of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism Soars Awesome Confidence
The elections to the parish council in 2015 will, for example, change fundamentally in the pastoral care unit Haslach (SE).
There is then only one parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For there is nothing left to change in the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parishioners to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism about the new is slowly but gradually giving way to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral care team ranged.
On the basis of a presentation, regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach as a congregation will form a public body, which will enter into the rights and obligations of the so far six individual church congregations.
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of trustees in which the pastor Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish; so-called community teams are to be formed in the six parishes.
Your task in the future will be to promote ecclesial life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parish congregation then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds are preserved in the parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, pass to the entire congregation.
Particularly with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which then all parishes meet, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," Haslach's parish president Bruno Prinzbach relativized.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the Schutterwald pastoral unit.
They had made themselves the task in 2006, "To become one, to remain five" and had to realize that this is not so easy at all.
The committees of the Haslacher Seelsorgeeinheit then started to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concrete in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the municipal utility company, Jörg and Arne Bias, confirmed to the SOUTH, a family of four Pfullendorf families will incur between 70 and 90 euros extra costs per year.
The rise in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour is a major reason for the upcoming price increase.
This levy is redefined each year in October by the four operators of the major electricity lines.
These quantify the additional costs arising from the energy transition, which they can raise by a levy over the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In his forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy, as reported by Jörg Trudeau Arne Bias.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the public utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, with the figure rather close to the 2 cent.
Light on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just does not turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What to do then - driving in red?
If a person affected waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting time, however, must be "appropriate", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the traffic light.
Those who continue the journey despite red light, however, must be aware that they bear the full blame for an accident caused by this.
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the higher regional court Hamm.
In this case a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped on green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
Municipal council welcomes solid budget
Whenever it is about the household in council meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal bakery in Herdwangen is well filled and debt has not been known by the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be booked as a complete success in this sense.
This became clear at the presentation of the 2012 financial statements.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million above EUR 1 million was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at around EUR 1.8 million, is also about EUR 1 million above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher trade tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The wealth budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the increased allocation from the administrative budget", says Rothmund.
Since less investment than planned was made in the financial year 2012, the allocation of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of your sleeves," praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils clearly enjoyed the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to do without high lifting rates in the past.
As a result, according to Gerster, subsidies have often been cut by the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory blocks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for subsidies must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the subject of lifting rates, because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this connection.
* Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 Hubert Wermter's story at the male singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, during which he was ceremoniously honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing association.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir, which is now more than he loved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including as a member of the committee for 28 years.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg and Stuttgart, presented him - as the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the ceremony, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual ways: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local Musikverein, the Vollmaringer invited a colourful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
To honour their honorary singer Hubert Wermter they prepared a little serenade - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choir songs like "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehen durch Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten with his mixed choir and his women's group - the "Impulschor" - provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singers ’ department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to their home countries with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert ’ s "Bierlied", where the full marching Musikverein offered the crowning musical finale.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children occupied the lunch over well.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centres in the Zollernalbkreis are receiving mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest messenger would like to support the institutions in the realization of their building and embellishment wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centres and nurseries from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the campaign.
If you have a building or embellishment wish for your institution, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest messenger, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 Euro and on one (action) day.
Furthermore, the winner himself has to provide many hardworking builders.
What about the action day and the helpers?
With the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb Bauhaus provides the material.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one may ask oneself: What keeps Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?", was read in the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star, by the new law, the government "effectively takes the media into a stranglehold". By contrast, The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered "a serious blow" and called the draft "draconian".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the West Gate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media caught the authorities ’ anger because they published shots of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping mall.
Political chief David Kimaiyo responded by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative for interrogation, even if the summons were withdrawn after media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be punished with up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
Furthermore, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's description of "vibrant blogosphere".
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a key control factor in public life.
"Leave politicians to themselves, lead the country into bankruptcy, and take us back to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
Kenyan legislators have already caused public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts imposed by the national remuneration commission and reinstated their defective salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month - among the highest in the world.
Bad Trudeau Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field lost nothing about the importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant ceremony last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those who came without umbrella or could not hold such one for any reason had the afterthought.
That went on for the musicians who framed the ceremony, just like many speakers.
Therefore, the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, was also wet.
His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and members of the association who contributed.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The wealthy pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by state parliament member Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn area so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first thoughts on the solution of the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the secondary school on the Salinensee was thought.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came to create an artificial turf sports field, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were initiated two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, agreed a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country subsidies of EUR 104 000.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to acquire the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros, summarised Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial turf pitch was started on 4 June.
During the construction phase, which lasted over three months, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the installation of a dirt bike route.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it concerns direct democracy, bribery of Members and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, it should be about dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double pass.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a passenger toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for driving a lot and thus ecologically counterproductive", said the SPD's negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threats of evasive traffic on land roads, which are already the focus of the accident.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The Singing Föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not actually the question on Friday evening on the open air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.

Driver seriously injured in an accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37 year old passenger car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Muesch was on the Kempener outer ring in the direction of Grefrath around 21.15.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The cone collided.
The Aachen suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51 year old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left-turn lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right lane.
Here it came to a collision with the BMW of a 23 year old Constance driving there.
The VW Passat behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19 year old.
The police reported that a total of around 15,000 damage was caused.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport handles passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will no longer be any announcements at Vienna ’ s Schwechat airport.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements are eliminated - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation.
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann told Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the recruitment of announcements concerning individual persons.
Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already renouncing the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average around 200 personal calls through the loudspeakers sound on one day - it is planned to get calmer at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information on changed flights or departures here is a bit sinking", says Kleemann in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander and Games at Kaltenhof
In addition to brake car pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the Autumn Agricultural Festival at Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, at 1.30 pm the Highlanders will start the Games.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they are swabian at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and single-warriors compete in the disciplines of tree truncation, horseshoe throwing and water egg carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter in the width", explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be dropped vertically, should beat over once and then just come to lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
When throwing horseshoes it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From eight meters distance is thrown on a stake.
The participants must prove their skill and strength when carrying water eggs over 50 metres.
Time and water in a vat are measured at the end.
Two of each "clan" or team can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Training can be done from 10 am.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the gravel skirt.
But Swabian costumes are also permitted.
For the "Outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish Highlander and the Traktor and Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening the brass music friends get their money's worth.
At 7 pm the biraböhmische brass music from the Federal Republic of Germany organises the big entertainment evening.
The band plays polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band and sound.
The Heinz Koch from Weilen, known as the singing host and black-sausage baron, will be present.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Christmas market.
On Sunday the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for breakfast, from 14 o'clock the farmers' chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" let the festival end.
The start is already on Friday the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf.
Other programme items are on Saturday and Sunday, including the Oldtimer and Tractor Meeting, exhibitions of companies dealing with agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday include the corn labyrinth, the craft market and sheep scissors.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncing castle, tractor driving (under instructions) and tractor and surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Skiclub and the Traktorfreunde "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with vegetable cream, for example, is a quark set.
The Vegetarian Federation calls others World Vegan Day on 1 November.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Vintage Day on 1 November:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, let yoghurt replace with soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oats, almond or rice milk can be used.
Impactable plant cream replace conventional whipped cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose dough instead of egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk yoghurt can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people currently live vegan, i.e. purely vegetable, in Germany.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight we went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, via which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided on Times Square.
Despite Shutdown on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Afterwards we went through the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city from the 373 meters high viewing platform of the Empire's State Building and enjoy the view.
Afterwards, we went through the hectic hustle and bustle of New York ’ s streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße on the name day of Saint Hubertus.
St. Hubertus was a rather reckless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe of the Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth makes music on Parforcehörnern (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The wind players wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog fans on towing.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to the encyclopedia, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In case of a visit to the café of the same name at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the University of Applied Sciences Rhine-Waal it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu.
Finally, the café with its beautiful name has exactly the goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but also tangible, always recurring.
Because it's just fun and just beautiful.
A look into the interior of Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café and ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team spoils the guests with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail options.
There are delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves before the opening of the pretty café at the Opschlag as a gastronomer: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag, the likeable café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least by the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
The two young students here want to address just as much as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of café and aficionados.
The sympathetic owner couple stands behind the coffee indulgence.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is a fan of Expresso and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events already in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", the two 33 year olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right".
And with an event I always talk only to those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
This means: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
Regarding the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a part of the gastronomy.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the club locally of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoyed the harmonious coexistence completely in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the right festival to make honours.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was this time rejoiced by the secretary Rolf Wagener.
"Not only did you write down a lot for us, but you also did some round for us, for that our heartfelt thanks", says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participating in the performances and rehearsals by means of a series of activities went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier and Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was occupied by sheet music director Artur Brückner.
The board addressed a special thank you to the team of club manager Ange Pier and Ribbert, who had once again created a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier and Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Frederick Wilhelm" meets for his regular choir rehearsals on Tuesdays at 7: 45 pm in the club ’ s cup.
"We are always warmly welcomed by new voices," says Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Goals for Poverty Reduction
The United Nations is now starting to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty Reduction announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They have been included in the final draft document which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to embark on a process to reach universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realise our vision of sustainable development objectives that build on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
Even if the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days, there is still a good mood in the handball league.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this.
Everyone continues to be fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't even know how such a victory tastes", Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out trees, Malmon lifts the index finger warning in advance.
Many players I have trained in the A-Youth.
Therefore they will certainly be particularly motivated against their Ex Coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait, whether there is still reinforcement from the first", clarifies the SG Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the previous performances.
Above all in the covering work and in the changeover play it haperte finally nevertheless mightily.
Equal opportunities must also definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to make calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment firm.
Out of fear for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the Independence Square of the capital.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the White ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal storage in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo Left Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo ’ s bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group ’ s leader, Renamo ’ s spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Compared to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique's expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo ’ s election successes have shrunk since 1992, while a newer party, Movimento Demokrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due if his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency", says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has committed unsettling attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North South connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month, after Renamo had announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already worried about corruption, slow progress in development, and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life", says an author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur's legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley and Holland called for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are "overly didactic" children would "completely switch off", because in entertaining stories the messages are "subliminal".
Crossley of Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them as far as possible in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything must be simplified or lead to a happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob pulls again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scenic game.
From the arrival to the bestowal of honorary citizenship to his death, script writer and Hansjakobdarsteller Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and bridged time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On 22 October 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children ’ s sky, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his paradise roll as the great son of the city.
He drove in style with the two-man and "Black Forest foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was received not only by the audience with much applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum and Hermann understood it incredibly well to get into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual playing scenes the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
For the award of the honorary citizenship Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor, who made his maintenance in representation of the then incumbent Hättich together with a part of the city council.
The three-queen singers, who brought Hansjakob to the exclamation, then made their expectation: "Oh how beautiful, youth memories of my own three-kingdom come alive again".
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
At that time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the game.
A lot of applause and many praising words were given by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants grows
The chances of the league remaining of the sporty demolition of the Ludwigsburger Bundesliga were increased.
Because if there should be a wildcard order, then there is now a competitor less for the Neckar giants.
The basketball club project Hamburg Towers waives an application for a possible return place.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard Procedure", said former president Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
Nevertheless, a first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure, as long as it is not established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar's giant boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, ascenders can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove their economic Bundesliga suitability.
Until now, however, the licence has been refused to the Rhineland countries twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Abendmahlskirche moves into focus
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the Cultural and Tourism Office of the city dedicates the last of its public themed tours this year on Sunday, October 27, to the Abendmahlskirche.
After the visit of the Atomkeller museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning conclusion is a visit to the Abendmahlskirche.
There the leaders get the story of the construction of the church told and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also looks at the evening meal paintings created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the one-and-a-half hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller.
There are maps at the cash desk of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General ’ s Office could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30 year-old in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax on the basis of unnamed circles who are familiar with the situation.
It was said that such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally.
Snowden ’ s departure from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the US, where Snowden is threatened with extradition, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men ’ s teams fought for the winning title at the clubs ’ tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier / Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter heads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were on the same spot as Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony Carmen Müller was finally able to present the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish straight.
The double Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic finished second.
The bronze podium was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher.
In late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the tournament ended successfully.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24th and 25th, as part of the summer holiday program for a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Both young and old can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.

The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also a trade union.
In the construction of cuckoo pipes, waterwheels or gyroscopes, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as wheelbarrows and stilts.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12: 00 and 14: 00.
On a cross-country tour, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or yet lie.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.

Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday programme.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovely cheek, because he has decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart defect, is not dissuaded from his dream.
With his savings, some donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships on the heap.
The company has several iron in the fire at its location.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind turbines and logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the camp site in front of the dike.
Two huge blue hedgehogs and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the envelopes a shrill alarm noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the case of unfavourable wind this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40 year old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now time to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
He will continue to focus on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot ahead at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the recumbent tub in front of the terminal, which has been deepened to 18.5 metres, Capesize ’ s bulk carriers can also be manufactured here.
"This year, we want to crack the 3 million tonnes of the brand", says Schrell.
In addition to the local power plant, import coal goes to inland power plants.
If, then, the GDF ’ s Suez power station goes to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria ’ s basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us from believing to win against the best team in Europe over the past two years," said Bavarian coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday night at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their third appearance in the European premier league, the Munich people sold themselves very well for a long time, but were not clear enough in the decisive phases.
At first the guests managed to transform a 15 points gap 13 minutes before the end into a lead before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made slight mistakes," said Bavaria's professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian production champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays Innovation has been expanded, as it was recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines booth, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well known to perform in a club," said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year ’ s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity event for armeeveterans in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Trudeau.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of the Comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slippery fantasy soccer league series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast both at "Saturday Night Live" and at "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll as well as Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell focused on racial themes) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors magnet of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a booth for the Comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a TV show with the title "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in Larry's entire work in the comedy DNA," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of recent years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and optimistic that both sides will eventually find a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Chimneys with Machete
Two children admitted in Uruguay the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victims to go hunting for birds with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11 year old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Afterwards they would have played football in front of their homes in a working quarter.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger, who had taken her away, said she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the daily routine in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11 year old.
One of the reasons for this was a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pimp must go to prison
For exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous assault, the district court of Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in a process agreement.
In five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the bottom of the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who partly earned for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards he undercut contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who conveyed the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert had great doubts about the mental limitation and thus about a limited guilt, the 33 year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
According to a critical officer, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings could be identified after a first announcement by means of telephone surveillance.
The interrogated talks were characterized by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, did not make a statement until today.
It is a "completely broken personality" that sees violence and exploitation as normal in this profession.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He has detached himself from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after the detention," he said.
Oil price goes down to 96 USD per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, too, after worries about a high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil variety for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe in the late morning.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price fall of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil offer has burdened the prices in the past weeks.
The US Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the US offer had increased last week by 4.1 million barrels.
In the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China ’ s economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8% in the third quarter, after reaching the lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil of the type Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by U.S. American refineries, fell on the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cent to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court obstructs decision on Stop and Frisk Directive of NYPD
On Thursday, a federal court of appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the New York Police Department ’ s stop and search program, and released the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin were suspended until the city ’ s appeal was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appellate report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court ’ s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with body-borne cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police inspection.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is planned after 14 March 2014.
A number of advocates of civil rights have criticised the Stop's and Frisk's tactics.
Such controls have existed in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men, during the mandate of the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a lawsuit which developed into a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as the way other police presidents use the scheme.
Opponents believe that changes would dampen police morality, but not crime; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure after thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end Stop and Frisk's practice, which was constitutional, but merely reformed the way in which the controls were carried out by the NYPD.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which already has considerable successes.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at Cheijk and Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the missions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the aforementioned actions.
The desert-vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Karlsruhe, had made the suggestion to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to become active at the association in advisory function.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry company from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a slum quarter on the outskirts of the capital, in a record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother and child's hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be wegrationalized.
One learns much in Africa as a physician, so Henne, for example, deceleration against Burn.
Due to the political unrest in the country one could not do as many trips as planned, but for this many physicians came to Germany to hospitality here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, including medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by talking from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young MEP.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global love for human beings.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then interior minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails and followed them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to catch them in fresh action, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories investigatively: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, monitoring, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone Hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors about Clark ’ s affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editor when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don ’ t waste your time, it ’ s together with Charles. ”
A band with voicemail from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
Investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective on which Pawlby and her sister were saved as "projects".
In the time when the research was ongoing, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby ’ s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk with Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman for an affair when he had himself co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks quarrel to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone Hacking.
In protest against the planned Reichensteuer, the French football will indeed go through the first strike since 1972.
A meeting of eyesight comes to an end without results.
In the conflict over the Reichensteuer, the government and the professional soccer team in France manoeuvred into a dead end after a failed pick-up meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and heard their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the proposed 75% tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be traversed, the head of the Association of Professional Lubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The games on Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are scheduled between 29 November and 2 December.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning early", opened mayor Jens Häußler the citizen information event to the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants had come to the community hall to be explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The floods, which hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared, had been an incisive event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, said Häußler.
A river basin investigation had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protecting as many plots as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
According to the German weather service, the planning is based on a statistical flood every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In experts this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a flood of 1000 years.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Häußler said.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, approximately four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect national subsidies of about 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that there was only funding if an overall concept was implemented.
To this end, the congregation is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case case, implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs for the protection of the place were planned.
Gregor Kühn, technical planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all presented measures in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
Furthermore, the most economical solution was to be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure among residents of the old town, who have to suffer again and again from overload of the sewer net even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the directives for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that regenerative events of two to three years could be tolerated.
The wastewater channels would devour millions larger.
Severe injuries after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the street completely, but at first could say little about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should only be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38 year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, and the woman was so heavily trapped that the fire brigade needed almost half an hour to free her from the wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both victims came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a god seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Stunning the kinship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as American prophets, who is quite well regarded in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, which distributes Haffmans ’ cassette with the 118 stories of two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, security delusion, and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read themselves like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer's Manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He has seen, early already, that the computers are divinity.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minorities' Report" dates back to 1956 and exudes the smell of the Cold War and McCarthy's tribunals.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick ’ s world, which resembles our terrifying, mutants look into the future – and the police are attacking.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We grab them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, but we have a criminal camp full of Pesudo criminals." They read time streams.
They assume that what is happening is bad and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA ’ s interception frenzy.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama ’ s drones also work philosophy and practice.
But Dicks story is not over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself will be supervised and transferred to a future crime.
The system turns through.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only does it accept errors and sacrifices, but it builds on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Late Office to Say Merkel in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Federal Foreign Office about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Attorney General ’ s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 year old person in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Prior to that, the Green Party member of the Bundestag, Hans Christian Ströbele, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA unveils reinforce company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany ’ s capital of finance.
By order of the Federal Office for Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the US Foreign Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a discussion between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US did not use foreign espionage opportunities "to steal foreign companies' business secrets on behalf of US companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit."
But since Edward Snowden, who became a whistleblower ’ s former employee, began publishing his cornet to US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director ’ s floor.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company ’ s paranoia to a new peak for government surveillance.
The keg overrun may have been ten years since the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone had vanished.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management will certainly be potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents leaked by Snowden that the US has passed on foreign company secrets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If a strong European IT industry had been wanted, they should not have died out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical sophistication of US intelligence agencies exposed by Snowden revelations shocked firms that had previously seen China ’ s biggest spy risk.
Cloud computing is a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to local jurisdiction and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of non-US-based members rejected plans to use an American vendor after revelations about U.S. data mining.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers who haven ’ t been there a year ago - it ’ s: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this legal space? ”
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place.
That has always been the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate governance usually does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that gives attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have been blowing in for a long time that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of car manufacturers Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as interception devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when they travel abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid handsets are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access", the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own firms about other countries ’ economic espionage.
According to Washington Post, in February, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia, and Israel behind China as two of the countries that served to obtain economic data from hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Interior Intelligence Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding celebration succeeds, gave now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers around a wedding were represented.
A trend: The retro look has returned.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front are the often scented and embroidered dresses closed, often with a veil, but in the back they go down the back and often end in a train.
But the ghosts are different, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from Kleidermüller.
In men the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The selection of the restaurant was important.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the carriage house.
Who then wants to drive forward with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for him.
"But carriages are also popular for young people," he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more fashionable is the "After Wedding" photo - i.e. shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Successful dog friends
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it with 87 points to 12th place.
Susi Höpp and her woody in class 1 took a critical look at the judge.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenage camp, whose body was found in a coiled Ringermatte in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, the lawyer told the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium.
Investigators of the Lowndes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17 year old ’ s family stopped.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, Kenneth's and Jacquelyn Johnson's lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he had died as the Sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that it is devoid of logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Her son went to school to study and came back in his body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death, as a number of important questions remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "position suffocation."
A second autopsy, however, resulted in another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriffs Authority was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.
The teenage parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government, as the number of school-based children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now have a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff, and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the EpiPen brand's car injection is most commonly used - to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently amended the rules to make it easier for schools to keep Epinephrine in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels as if a hair is lying on it," or "my tongue is tingling".
Parents of intersexual children can choose "sex indefinite"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unambiguous genitals.
Newborn is no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can indicate "indefinite" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for sex allocation in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said years later, "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is born every year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that fall under the diagnosis "sex differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most US experts advise that the best available information on sex allocation should be used if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding, if any, for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds like a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One could perform a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops its sexual identity at all is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is happening.
It is like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-based, but is conditioned by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were found in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons face in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Not matching the gender picture boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May Welby (52) was recognized as the world ’ s first “genderless ” person after a court granted lifelong retention of a“ unspecified ” sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will in future have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, on the grounds that: "If the world is dragged into a new state, where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
"Parental existence is already stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if one does not know the sex of one's own child," she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine regarded sex as something that could be eradicated and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century this was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with non-unambiguous genitals dates back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who argued that the sex was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses - as parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person considers himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John / Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to completely castrate the child and also to remove his testicles and then raise him up as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public who are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY and male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after his birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth - and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After he learned the truth, he changed back to male identity, got testosterone injections and let his breasts be removed.
Through the operation he became infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar and Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, are worried that German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and not to assign 'fixed' to the child," she said.
We fear that this favours interventions.
We think it would be better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
TamarMattis said her organization supported the Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorised" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although it is barren, it hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine - one pulls the child big and loves it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents' happiness.
And you don ’ t have to hurry up an operation that can no longer be undone.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents around because they think they wouldn't do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex that suits him better - and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown hurt girls by shot from car
Unknown have injured a twelve-year-old in a car shot in Saxony.
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening with an air force.
The police in Burg reported that.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf.
They brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police investigated it on Friday.
Until now, Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children, which threw them against house facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and immediately removed the egg remains, also no damage should have arisen.
Furthermore, some New Year's Mowers were ignited in the city area, but also here no damage occurred.
A local resident in the Bishop of Friendship reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his bicycle panels were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found his bicycle panels in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with a future perspective
Actually Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern to be unable to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus surgery, the mid-fifties have experienced what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently a book by her has appeared on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which housing form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age ', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the greenery.
Today at the middle of fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most displace it as long as it goes.
Only the others become old, 'she says with a smile.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, do one think.
'Then it can be too late', Ries says.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 home models for self-determined living in old age.
'Which housing form you choose, however, is always an individual decision ', she explains.
T he solution did not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also become ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language one also unites in the Dolce Vita,' gives the technical book author to consider those willing to relocate.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted pensioners WG.
In old age everyone has their ticks and faults
'For me such a shared apartment would be nothing, 'she says with a wink.
Not at all as in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you simply need your retreat rooms', Ries says.
Nevertheless, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a seniors' housing community can still function.
This must then be different from the classical student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest ', she believes.
With this opinion, it is not alone in the state capital.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of Citizens' Services Life at the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people around the topic 'Become an Elder'.
That is why elderly people in particular would often also accept inconvenience and restrictions, only to stay in their familiar surroundings, which is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment should first of all inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to adapt the existing apartment to age requirements and thus to make it barrier-free, even if it is so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
Although one could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the paved path with stairs to the apartment door would be far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
In front of the procession it greets her more than before the spider on her apartment door.
USA wants Snowden to continue prosecuting
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He was also accused of having passed on unlawfully secret information.
That is why he has to face criminal proceedings in the US, said US State Department spokesperson Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Nor would the recent Snowden statements change that.
Prior to that, the German Greens had appealed to the US, following a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel's statements were those of a parliamentarian, not that of a German member of the government.
Secret service student Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
This was made clear in an unaddressed letter by the former NSA co-workers, who were sought by the USA, which was published by the Green Party politician Hans Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter has the following wording:
To the responsible persons
I was asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously contracted or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me to act on a moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-embracing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society derived from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks that have been accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a trespass and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this reprehensible stance.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and by law in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The congregation is satisfied," emphasizes Maier.
100 000 euros were earmarked in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking for the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone", Maier is pleased.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a space concert on the terrace of the Hammer Inn.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the baton at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces.
In this context Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first music hock.
Report: Obama Election Campaign Reflected to Replace Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Blatter with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, the New York Times said.
The unveiling is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin ’ s long-awaited work and John Heilemann ’ s 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and she reported on Thursday night that the president ’ s top advisors had conducted “major group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s diminishing hope for re-election would look better if he dropped Netanyahu.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book traces thoroughly the history of efforts by leading campaign and White House officials, notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on poll values to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton for vice president.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and the White House ’ s senior advisers, David Axelrod, and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley has been at the forefront of the effort to exchange Berlusconi despite her "close, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Netanyahu with Clinton.
"I said a number of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the President had terrible survey values at that time, so we thought: "For God's will, what are we doing?"
While Daley called the investigation "due care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move was paying for the ballot boxes.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if one does not seriously think about something," Martin said on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at that time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama's political explorations had reached his desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama had not known anything about the investigation of whether to drop Berlusconi in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Was the letter secret technically implemented in the draft of the Internet service E-mail similar to conventional mail?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take care to create a stable foundation for an audible correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the e-mail server of their service provider.
For example, if you have a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni.
On the route the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software and robots.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail has a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
Furthermore, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
There are also possible illegal delays.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted to read along.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an E-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to recognize who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an August 2013 survey by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
Whereas Yahoo's shares had recently fallen, GMail was able to increase significantly.
Mother in the forest hid and retired collected
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to pay their pension and care.
A 67 year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest in order to be able to continue to collect pension and care money.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, then he spent more than a year and a half in the money.
Now the 67 year-old must answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it became clear that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because the officials were curious about this, they continued to investigate.
It came out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained it.
The 67 year-old had finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy did not provide evidence for a capital crime.
Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous delicacy.
The idea came to him after reading research on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which increases the pH value in the protein and causes the light to shine.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and glows - the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced, because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his newest creation should become even more ambitious.
He says, "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is, in itself, impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six days of play.
The team of Ingo Ehlers will now come to the Derby against TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season begins anew for us.
"I hope that we finally have our heads free," Ehlers is optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Also Daverden sets as we on Tempospiel.
We therefore need to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase the coverage that has left anything but a sure impression.
Daverden ’ s coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed after the first victory of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that ’ s why we ’ re not the favorite, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to put up in Morsum to start a series.
There will be no Jan Malte Jodat.
For this the A-juvenile Joost Windßuß, who is active with double play right at the A-Youth HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become a Halloween muffle.
Over the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I think I will not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be precise - are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Federation of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion US dollars out of 6.9 billion dollars, the NRF said.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer need to dress in sexy clothes, they can now embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft will make Punk ’ s space men into Instagram ’ s feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, the NRF said.
These are a lot of "hot dogs".
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not trivial.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, sweets and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who pass through the quarters with the slogan "Sweet or Saures".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let us not imagine - eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is candy corn, but 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I could not solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it spits.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl -O -Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which earn $500 million in proceeds, so America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos, on which one pees straight into the pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where one does not get rid of them again, and one then the type, on which one stands, leaves a comment like "nice facial expression".
But we finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we have made from small up.
Fortunately, the "baby in pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, slowly rotting in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Wohnungsbrand in Helmbrechts: Coal corpse
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmbrechts on late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the county of Hof catches fire during the night to Friday.
The police harbor a charred corpse from the house.
During a fire in Helmbrechts a charred corpse was found in a three-family house.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames already hit out of a window.
The volunteers went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire, the mayor continued.
The building was no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany ’ s largest national church has launched an offense to promote the pastor ’ s profession.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the workflow and the course of the day itself.
With Burfien, the regional church commissioned a pastor on a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after leaving school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-ecclesialization: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can focus on where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This comes to meet the young people of today who are not only interested in careers, but in a full-bodied work.
According to the regional church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the emsland or the Wendland, it can become difficult in future to occupy places.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology offers broad training.
You can even become a Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and Six point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler ’ s engineers and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally's customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the strains and reality of Rally Raid.
We had really fun to develop the Defender Challenge cart - that will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge offers a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a dog that was 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cockerspaniel and bitch Ruby had run away after a small traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament
Firefighters stranded on rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to bring a dog into safety, which stuck on a 15 meter high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel female Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alzusammen, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she had escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2: 15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the site and abseiled to rescue Ruby, which was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue specialist, said, "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue - she was frozen like stiff.
But now she is doing well.
She then eaten a few dog pie.
This was a rather unusual effort.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge accident."
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Al from Keighley added, "We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never did Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she ate with the old rocker at night, and that "he offered me when I was 18."
She added: "That's been a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance this year during the Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album "Prism" landed right away on place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would entail more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU ’ s member states often bend their strict rules when it is cheaper for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-respect for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what one really wants of the Scots.
So actually no story.
And one that has already come so in the years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I have heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for uniting Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro over board as a single currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – which was only founded this year – could win nearly five million votes in the September Bundestag election, effectively driving Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket to which the national economy is forced by sticking to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that happen.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe is found again with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and quadruple for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world ’ s wage specifications do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt comes up, especially in France, the EU ’ s former cheerleader.
After the war, France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany at bay and to raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has pushed Europe down its own economic policy, which is what the troubled French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive re-election, placing the ruling socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing split would automatically bring benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white Frenchmen of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-EU single currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and that is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellites may hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flatter itself in the US.
However, Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last resort) Small Britain.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide where.
I suspect that Scotland could do well in a more relaxed European network if we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same as Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNB government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib had to account for The Coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now, only to be imposed on austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Getting Grown Faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter is already growing at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - usually this is not a sign that puberty is now fast," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious displays of the development, such as growing breasts, sham- and armpit hair as well as body smell, show up in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first menstrual bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach the menarche," said Kaplowitz, author of the book "Early puberty for girls: The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually marks the beginning of puberty, but it is' early 'when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In case of faster progress, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and preventing another result: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reserved for medicines, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter received her days with ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys come into puberty similar to girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys grow their facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards a complete earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP Conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even among babies and infants.
"We must be careful to identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls blooming early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo ’ s manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, which indicates the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always those most sought by airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard that would require a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed - especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats - is crucial for the indicated economic results, which the new "Mini Jumbo" design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" fasse 406 people in tourist class seats, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war, showing donors a picture in which three people sit squeezed together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats closer than regional turbo props," says Airbus Vice President Sales John Leahy.
In the face of changing eating habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to data from the US Department of Health.
According to US Health Statistics, the waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a 1950s seating concept when the average body circumference of the freshly christened "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out to prove that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleeping quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the figures of Airbus to the seating dimensions and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between air fares and equipment.
The company also explains that, according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It really means giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed," explains Boeing's cabin expert Kent Craver.
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
Passengers are more free of elbows, but for manufacturers it will increasingly be an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the argument is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the USA or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365 Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing ’ s statements on the results partly depend on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than with presently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft in order to make it more competitive to our products", says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat posed by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin equipment, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world travelers jet sellers even carry tape gauge with them to measure the setup in the competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compact design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten seater rows, but according to its own statement has not yet sold.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of increasing cabin adaptability and offering wide seats on aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to disappear, but could detract from the 777X ’ s wave of sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking out
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before tests on humans, further trials are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine and antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which does not cause a smoker to experience nicotine.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered to nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination on the other hand would have taken a "time-out", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, transforming liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be administered to children for people, if he is quite sure, before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thereby preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop it.
"They know then: When they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to put off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned at the same time that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies to have been influenced by Obeid
The former Labor Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the State Corruption Supervisory Authority.
At the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden holdings in three properties on state-controlled land, the former NSW minister denies having changed the regulations on maritime leasing.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid had influenced various Ministers of State to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined that Tripodi had known about both sides of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land after Tripodi ’ s former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, said accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the Circular Quay companies, which contributed $2.5 million annually to both sides, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally called for public tenders.
But he denied having made the amendments at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reorganization of the government ’ s lease regulations.
A telephone transcript submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial leasing schemes?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I cannot remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter planes attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA and 125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visa could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign workers with a visa of 457.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used on a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government proposal for discussion was published after the former Labour Party MP Maxine McKew had condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as insults by Australia ’ s neighbors.
"Strong explanations like foreigners are supposed to stand in the back 'and, Australians first' are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some in the region were to hear this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Migration Minister Brendan O Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the proposed changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be verified as to whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to or personally associated with the proprietor or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 Visa holders, after hundreds of companies who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers in the past have ceased.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan Asylant probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man, who had come to Australia with him, has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father ’ s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England already at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to look for further stretching capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unequivocally" advocate Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economy of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner to the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow connection to Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to ease regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airline companies to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their eBooks when starting and landing.
Australian companies are observing the decision that US American airlines will have to do a lot of work to implement, but are not following immediate plans to amend their rules.
The CASA also said that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still apply in Australia.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft", was announced.
The subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA on extending the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and declares that they are open to change, but that they have to be initiated by the legislature.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a spokesman.
Qantas explained that one will remain with the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current directives stipulate that electronic devices cannot be used at start-up and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that allow passengers to benefit from, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA ’ s decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects on US American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, eBook readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when landing and starting.
Before the Bundesliga round against Schalke BVB supporters with light rockets had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins and Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced tough consequences.
Before the Friday match of the football Bundesliga Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runner-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were fans with their songs.
The Südtribüne, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the loyal - and loudest - BVB - fans stand, presented itself at first exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The pedestal of Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint firing, remained unoccupied.
And in the front of the grandstand a big flag with inscription "Sektion Stadionverbot" blew lonely.
Only as Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, boasted a short cheering.
When his team-mates followed, there were loud vocals and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel listed again the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, Sieg über Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Moreover - did not cause a festive mood.
Only five minutes before the kick-off, the Capo climbed his pedestal - and the tension, which until then was almost tangible with hands, unloaded in a loud cry, when Dickel, as usual, queried the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Last but not least, as always, the south grandstand was on the line - and finally here again, as usual, was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbysieger steht auf" came with kick-off from the South Tribune, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before the German Premier League (FC Schalke 04), some of BVB supporters had fired light missiles into the audience ’ s passages and on the pitch – almost hitting goaltender Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB's boss Hans Joachim Watzke had received the heads of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you think Watzke's words, this was a rather unpleasant appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," announced BVB's boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure Watzke forbade the ultra a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will set a sanction by the end of the next week.
"That will be drastic," Watzke assured.
One may be curious, how the reactions in the south tribune then fail.
Pfandhäuser booming in Singapore, as the crisis has reached the middle class
In a pawn house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there is all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars (approx. 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also worked, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is increasing - is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its swap, this week became the third pawn listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a fast way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as favorable as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnhouses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent demanded by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, Pfandhäuser offer the advantage that there is no need to check the creditworthiness or income certificates, which is why loans are faster than possible with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawnhouses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in developed economies, families with lower and middle-income pawnhouses are looking to compensate for the difference in stuttering economies.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, described as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, according to the agency, the highest fiscal debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a persistent export weakness and a decrease in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, given rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have intensified the trend towards the attachment of personal items, as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are gold in the city ’ s 200 pawnhouses.
People say to themselves, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge grandmother's gold chain and bring back next month."
The largest Thai pawn house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% customer increase in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have come into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnhouses not only provide cheaper interest rates than other lendors, but also do not directly raise the debt.
"Customers insult items they already own, and the liquefying of personal valuables does not increase household debt," she explains.
The pawn lending business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Not all people who use pawn loans are also in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax ’ s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
"These include wealthy people who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service investigator Edward Snowden has a principled interest in helping Germany to find out more and more about the increasingly explosive NSA.
In his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, the Green Euro MP Hans Christian Ströbele described the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify to a German prosecutor ’ s office or a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to ARD's "Panorama" magazine.
$325 million Australian dollar rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $325 million bailout for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has launched an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 billion package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic procedures and gray star treatments, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after in-patient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that I was told by the hospital staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent aid, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state's public health system off the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these electoral services will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “pavement solution ”.
"We are in a position today because the labor government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government is pulling nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and putting 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretending to be good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, said a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and grid-gas facilities, the Global Monitoring Group on Chemical Weapons said on Thursday, while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the civil war began.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day before the date
1 November, which the Organization of Damascus, based in The Hague, had set up to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons or to make them "inoperable", including all machines for the mixing of chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still needs to begin to destroy the weapons and supplies available.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, as reported by the United Kingdom ’ s Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
The activist group, which persecutes the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people died.
Of these, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 being pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militia.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have links with al Qaeda.
The observatory said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underlines the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal of arms is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites listed by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two institutions was not possible, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "abandoned... and the chemical weapons program's existing sites had been moved to other facilities mentioned there, which were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I take care of the courage and courage you have shown all in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad ’ s government and its security forces, to which many Alawites belong, a secession of Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, Rami Abdurrahman, head of the observation group, said that there had been a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Wrath on Judgment for Bali Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 resented the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, as Umar Patek believed that they were to be shot by stand.
Patek, who was one of the most sought after people in Southeast Asia for almost ten years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict was also found in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life imprisonment, even if they could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also called "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a masterful bomb builder.
The decision aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"One should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a rucksack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times as he hung on a life-support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.
Really, this type should be given the death penalty before all the others.
To leave him alive - no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber to stand in court.
He eluded nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US military forces killed Al Qaeda ’ s former chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't stand up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict was delivered before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek may still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music, and watch movies, but not make phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight staff and the rules for the stowing of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are only allowed to start them again when the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must switch them off again and must not start them again before the plane has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to larger heights for the use of Wi and Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new scheme is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline on this - both sides will benefit from it," commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like supervisors on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So there ’ s still no “Words With Friends ”, the Scrabble resembling online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to switch off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops still need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission poles," says Rosenker.
A Industry Advisory Committee, launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies mention that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore switching off the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers, after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication devices had become known by VHF radios carried by passengers, which at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they have no electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing passengers for several years now, when the altitude is reached.
The planes adapted to Wi and Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
Huerta said that the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, eReader emit only minimal radiation when you flip around.
But when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect them.
FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he felt that the disturbance caused by the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only occasional reports of pilots who spoke for a disturbance of aircraft systems by the equipment, and most of them were very old.
The Committee, however, recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the deactivation of the equipment by the passengers in poor visibility conditions in case of instrument landing.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as sensible adaptation for travellers who would be equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service of the North Sea
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The watershed was flown last month by helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was patched up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said, "This water rall was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He couldn't continue flying, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water ralle was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe ’ s elite willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in Britain who care for prosperity and work want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, representing around the UK corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and are concentrating on countries that are modernising and growing, while the Member States are stagnating in the EU.
They want government to favor new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, rather than stop the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about their view on certain issues regulated by law - from antitrust to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market because, according to companies, the cost of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40% of large companies agreed to be the most vulnerable in Europe.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings the booklet of action back to Britain.
There is a great deal at stake - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16%.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means greater attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the start of a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom ’ s Board of Directors.
“Today ’ s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, ” said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase diversity in Russia ’ s export routes across Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk for conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were 'forever' eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries will start on the planned route towards the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past Germany ’ s real estate location.
The economic framework data are correct, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the stock exchanges.
The German real estate markets profit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
This was pointed out by Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchanges.
According to Ulbrich, the look at the transaction volume shows how sought German commercial properties are.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive return," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were indicted for sexual crimes against children before charges were levelled against Caringbah child caregiver Jonathan Lord in 2011, as the Royal Commission for the Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
But in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "the organization had never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been indicted for crimes against child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been sentenced in 1991 for abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second case.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in saying that "there had been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety".
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed to hire Lord "from me down" and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report infringements of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been sentenced to twelve boys at the beginning of the year for sexual offences during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s infringements in relation to the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed infringements, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as babysitters, let them sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a training for child protection because she was worried about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord Superiors in the YMCA Caringbah, "was very intimidating and very unapproachable most of the time."
The Managing Director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to submit notification to their superior.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, so they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the YMCA NSW board of directors that the lesson the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan's Lord's Incident" was "not about reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the charges occurred was made by the managing director of YMCA's child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence, but that was "overzealous" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011 when Jonathan Lord was employed there, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, to the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in hiring, checking, training, and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59 year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard in the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the equestrian show ’ s experts arrived in droves in Cardiff to select the horse of the year, they realized that a tough competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee tracked loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both equally large, were praised for their performance, behaviour and style at the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which lay far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the whole field and went off with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, "The whole audience was electrified and everyone fired and clapped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
Just as he started, it won ’ t take long for him to be on the “Horse of the Year ” show – and I ’ m sure he ’ ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The jurors judged Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide - and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I ’ m sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothes have contributed their part to making that fit really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese Newspaper to be "Reformed" after Call
A Chinese newspaper calling for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a part-state company.
The New Express is now being subject to "comprehensive rectification", the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued in Guangdong by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the Neue Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the publicly listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the Neue Express was disordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said she had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended identifying the relevant persons with the New Express and immediately checking the New Express management team."
Chen had written several articles for the Neue Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it first and foremost because I was out on money and fame.
It has become clear to me that I have acted wrongly.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page and said that they had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a legislative amendment earlier this year, in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railroad between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 by 90 centimetres tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected, the authorities said.
Eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured in the discovery of the tunnel, the Court notes.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses a challenge for drug cartels to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 meter long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't run exactly as we plan or hope for it."
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36 year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and her son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is very different from this.
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream, ice cream or a strong Edam, these gourmets are not on a vegans menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may ask oneself, but upon closer examination the vegan world of nutrition is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local Reformhaus, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian".
At the turn of the century the next step took place and I became vegans.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but also because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather of normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the vegan maxim extending to the entire consumption behavior.
Instead of rummaging burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegans quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm rose.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact vegan does not represent a renunciation, not asceticism, but it is an enrichment." The assumption that with the dietary change one reduces the choice of food options, leads Proctor rather back to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that led to the failure of some still well-meant attempts.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And turn on: "Certain tastes are not fixed to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegans point out.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste quite hearty.
Of course, one would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
"It should taste, but this is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high performance strands that feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are excellent, I often check out", Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegan critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat, which one buys in the refrigerator, the vitamins B12 are high", finds Proctor.
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Wide distances must not go to proctor for food procurement.
Basic foods are available everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on site.
Only now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that's how it behaves with" ordinary "finished products well known".
Anyway, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake Proctor could also surprise his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegans a new flavour.
This has dynamism, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
But of course he was already skeptical.
Does my food no longer taste you?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions one must act as a vegans with instinct.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to spend an enclave time.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as assumed - and the vegans are not as restricted in everyday life as they are generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many önerläden offer falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka", says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he evades pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants adjust so slowly to it.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there is enough demand, they may be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Particularly if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as colouring agents, one seems to leave the courage with the following ethics with so many hurdles and traps quickly.
Not only because of this, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
"Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows which characters and logos one has to pay attention to" It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand still or to stumble ", knows Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes the consciousness.
Perhaps he does not quite manage to put his habits aside, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers still in breath.
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon in Germany.
In a notification the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures at the stock exchange operator.
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two glitches in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent mass faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total share trading in the US came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
In addition, the IPO of Facebook caused a sensation last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been up to the flood of purchase and sales orders, later determined the stock exchange supervision SEC and thwarted the company to a record fine of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Cyclist rides 63 year olds around
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., was on the left-hand side of the station square in the direction of Marktstätte.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man entered the walkway from a restaurant, the cyclist could not brake in time according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a 15 centimeter long round at the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police to issue an extradition notification
Today, the British police handed over an extradition decision to WikiLeaks ’ founder Julian ∑, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had been sent a "request to face" asking him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, he was in danger of being arrested.
After the UK law has exhausted its ability to do so since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month, ∑ threatens extradition to Sweden for charges in a sexual offence.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "sent a request to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we have chosen", a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The message gave no comment on the delivery of the police call.
He fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible charges of espionage after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks revelation website.
driver, who was between his legs with 210 km / h and hot drink, receives £1,000 penalty
A driver was charged a fine of £1,000 for driving up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
Howie was guilty in front of the Colchester District Court without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay £90 and a £100 victim surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London ’ s speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp tax on homes in the 2012 budget, which cost over £2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, the revenue from the stamp tax for residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were at 708 million pounds in fiscal year 2012 / 13, the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increase in the stamp tax on high-priced housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign investors more reserved about buying real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London ’ s prosperous south-west belt, stretching from Wimbledon to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog ’ s tail swelling and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "Human beings know well that the left and right hemispheres of the brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail swelling of their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or the other
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs movies with dogs - either a true version of nature or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to steer the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail-inclination was mainly to the left (again from perspective of the dog, which waves), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, in which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and wedging with the tail in one direction is rather connected with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Bristol University, said that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada stood the following: "Dogs tend to go to a robotic dog when his tail is leaning 'left and not right, instead of getting restless - exactly the other way around than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could therefore stir that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robotic dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined - and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
But since their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to illness Alex Turner
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer is ill with laryngeal inflammation.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
On 22 February Pope Francis will be called for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the Papal election - that is a group of 120 "elective cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all Cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new Cardinals, also known as the Consistory.
"Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in advance in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals entitled to vote will probably have fallen by February.
He said that a Pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals entitled to vote would again be 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The consistory next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, says Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all new.
Valero said that the bishops were typically called to cardinals from large places, but Francis "was full of surprises - so we do not know who he is calling".
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat rest
General Motors is calling back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks built in 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest, according to a communication from the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
For some of the cars there can be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in head restraints.
"When driving from the rear to the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury", was read in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The retrieved models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US automaker since the insolvent restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the sixteen-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car purchases in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM stock rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Obama ’ s voters ’ cry of desperation
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not apologize to the Site ’ s problems of drone attacks
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I believed would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish writing my patients in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a breath away from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory, and news reporters stopped to reflect the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Turning back to the present is an evil awakening, as if to be torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and multifaceted things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I, too, believe that the partisan blockade policy has overturned too many aspirations to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up trying to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is permitted to intercept foreign leaders or kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives, and why whistleblowers are punished to reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar Al Awlaki, a US American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon government."
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict its preceding political campaigns.
Obviously, the office of deputies is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown offensive massacre shape public debate.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I again elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfil the hope that we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama ’ s approval drop to less than 45% this week, the book ’ s return to 2008 has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in Pennsylvania ’ s primary elections.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his employees that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has had conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave, because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars to CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to delete or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, and Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He finds himself in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine and Coast seat of Netanyahu with 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process so that it could proceed more quickly.
Tony Abbotts daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which you marched in, enter the data into a computer, select immediately and then have the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can then erase the results if you don't like them?
It is unbelievable to vote with pencils nowadays.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is about serving the public.
"We do not strive for any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly taking off.
Some of the world ’ s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion a day change owners.
The two merchants would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation resulting in the scandal surrounding Libor ’ s interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on suspension, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue are continuing and we are cooperating fully with FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation stated that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a previous trader to the UK supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now expected to have been allowed to leave his current position as European head of the forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders was accused of any misconduct.
Usher ’ s Instant Message included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma declared that it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has upset traders in an area that in recent years has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms means that "one can influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had quit a London Exchange Traded Funds dealer this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed and cooperated with the competent authorities.
"We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Painted the fence on the Bechtle Plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle Plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the area threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the BI action, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
But that did not disturb the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - if the giant project failed one day.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they begin to resign, because the city continues to delay these answers, the BI says.
The mayor ’ s public statements also have an effect on how to hear.
In the municipal council meeting in May, he had said that he feared the end of the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear to be terrified because of this, others see it as a "crude blackmail attempt" on the population, according to the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the colour and all the helpers.
Rangnick Schelte für Schiris: Mane no Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, the leader of the "Bullen" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he took the two offensive more effective on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest reason for Rangnick ’ s criticism was Yellow for Mane at the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became an alleged acting disaster - which was certainly none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A glaring mistake," said Rangnick, who called the referee Harkam "totally overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg's coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig's coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He clearly defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation".
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I would not know why.
"Because I am the one who was offended," stressed the 46 year old.
But Rangnick gave a hymn of praise in view of the success.
"There are only two words for this: correctly good," he said.
There is not much to suspend.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
This is supposed to continue calmly.
There will hardly be any changes in the cadre during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except for a player who wants to leave the club," Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s health law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces US citizens to conclude health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional within the state's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts took the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of law, and also held that the requirement of the Health Act that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been resolutely rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland raved at the launch ceremony in TV2.
Some inhabitants of the valley managed to cope with sunchairs, others set up sunglasses for safety reasons.
So far, sun-hungry people had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea, however, has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million kroner (about 615,000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided winter sunshine to the Italian alpine village of Viganella for some years.
Post empties hardly on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday reading are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the city districts, but one reads the small print on the yellow containers of the post office AG, one finds quickly out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place", the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and public holidays, only before the postal building in the Ernst and Ludwig Strasse 36 and in Jakob and Müller Strasse 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is also emptied on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the request of the FDP.
The socio-political and youth-political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch up here.
Sunday reading is an important postal service, especially at appointment mail.
"Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, this undertaking radically and unreasonably reduces this."
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberal Group and the City Association, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that the vacancy times are being changed or deleted here in secret".
From the proximity of the citizens, the post office is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied on Sundays", says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens would have to reach a mailbox with Sunday reading also within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to talk to the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But to his knowledge there is also a Sunday reading in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are to rise vigorously
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the city ’ s magistrate is advising on a presentation by traffic commissioner Stefan Majer (Green).
Accordingly, parking charges are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry and Commerce considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibility immediately before the shop was "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller specialist dealers".
The transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
The men I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb in the Schiller School Gym in Reutlingen with a narrow squad.
The elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon it became apparent, however, that they, also due to age, could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstädter.
With the hard and placed surfaces the Gönninger did themselves extremely hard.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were not at the place with the block-defense.
Two high first sentence wins clearly expressed the superiority of the citizens of Freudenstadt in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and play-determining performance, the third set was then won a little lasch and lustless to the 3: 0 final score (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
On November 2, the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to assert itself clearly, will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood opposite each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and points in the acceptance of the ball; even in the passports, the precision was sometimes scarce, and in some critical game scenes the overzeal prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this performance very balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team consistently matched the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small Engländerhütte
A group of committed participants met at the small English-speaking hut in Ibach for the fifth day of nursing in the footsteps of the Natura 2000 and the Upper Hotzenwald project.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut off on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers described this area as the splendour of the gorge ridge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time with the touristic aspect the ecological consideration could also find.
Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide view is to preserve the now strongly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for the conservation of species.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss a lance to break at this point for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous completion of the achievements for the future with the life protection project as well as the previous care days.
After these various remarks, the head of the district, Christoph Wehle, and the life manager, Cornelia Bischoff, divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in the run-up, the forestry tug could be called up.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipalities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet registered.
The 46 year-old banker and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen is the only candidate to succeed Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer candidate for age reasons.
The application deadline will expire on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel ’ s patent
On Thursday, the group, which owns thousands of former Nortel ’ s patents, filed an avalanche of claims for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid by Nortel at the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought Nortel ’ s patent for US $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringement before the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents relate to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit that hits the core of Google ’ s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for the North German Patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After overriding Rockstar ’ s patents at Nortel, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library of patents.
"Although Google failed with its attempt to acquire the action patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," said the lawsuit.
Rockstar demands a high level of damages from Google, as it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt swears first freely elected presidents
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the tribunal dressed in black robes, who had his seat on the Nile and imitated an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the festive ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability", said the 60 year old Morsi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which had been strongly targeted by the respective government since its foundation 84 years ago as a forbidden organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived shortly after eleven o'clock local time in a small car voi.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential splendour of Mubarak ’ s time, the traffic was stopped only for a short time, so that the autoclave could cross the usually busy street connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but also to all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak to the goal.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," the mursi dressed in a blue suit with a red tie told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he should give his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel that played the national anthem, which he listened to in the postures.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people present in the university ’ s largest auditorium with chants of “The army and the people are one hand ”.
The University of Cairo, established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi made a symbolic oath in Tahir Square on Friday, the birthplace of the uprising, which led last year to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule, and promised to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from the head of state chased out of office.
But when the official oath is placed before the court and not before Parliament as usual, it bends to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi ’ s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening "Pump this party" is said, tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 "party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker crashed from ladder: seriously injured
When a defective foreign sensor was replaced, a 51 year old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder on Thursday and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior façade of a inn.
When he climbed the ladder, which was leaning towards the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Landeskrankenhaus Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rape in South Africa: Two Lifelong Detention
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17 year old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two years of life on Friday.
This was reported by the station SABC.
The victim had later died of the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Cana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had provoked horror throughout the country.
The then 21 year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the young was so appalling that the nurses needed psychological assistance.
During the trial, Kana had admitted to have been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to have beaten and raped her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially started out of several perpetrators, but dismissed two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor ’ s office also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost part of everyday life in South Africa: there are about 64 000 reports every year about sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, they have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women ’ s associations in South Africa estimate the darkness in sexual violence to be 10-25 times higher.
Jumbo visits Black Forest Ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7 visited Star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important for the ham are the pigs, Turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham be a quality product that you get in every supermarket?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest explains Jumbo the working method of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces Black Forest ham.
He only comes inside the factory with hair protection and coat.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the microphone.
Jumbo sighted for strengthening with fast food in Waldshut
"Here huge quantities are worked", amazed the TV-maker, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what matters in quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph ’ s value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph's value.
"I'm curious if you measure Roberto Blanco what happens", says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching it is worthwhile anyway.
The spectator sees that disassembling the clubs is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo visually of a "U" boat.
The trick: Fir branches provide here in the smoke for the special taste of Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test of feeding.
"He's really delicious," said the TV star.
All participants will be able to live with it.
You thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now assumes an adjusted pre-tax profit of between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are reached, this means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year, particularly in Australian and UK private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track towards record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, balancing a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, it was good for Flight Centre ’ s leisure business in the UK, while business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third consecutive year.
The shares of Flight Centre yesterday rose by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In future, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
As of 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and Mathematics - the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE ’ s structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Netanyahu said that there is a "broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and stringent".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries.
Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math examination - combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings - will probably encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from the right life", including financial mathematics.
Lovely animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour blows will be presented this weekend at the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday
The local association W514 is once again organizing this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district Soest show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges presented the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the evaluation of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The Rabbit Show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola and a tasty cafeteria with special prices.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, the topic is "On Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on the Handling of the Last Things".
Lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes Salem, the castle Salem and the Kulturamt Bodenseekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how people classify the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much about it, and thereby placed on those images of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas today", the contemporary prophetic doctrine is characterized by the hopes for completion rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been thoroughly expelled by Christians through religious critique," the speaker says.
She "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have been lost".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the nuisance of death".
This involves the question of that longing "which dreams that in the end everything will be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the University of Freiburg.
She earned her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg confirm their creed in the Confirmation
In two services 101 15 and 16 year old young people of the pastoral unit Am Kleine Heuberg were confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato and Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Sacrament of Confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and prayed for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past few months, under the guidance of deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, the confirmations had prepared for the great feast day.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced together the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
In splendid weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course across the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee informs about this.
Among the participants were, in particular on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, also numerous cyclists, who wanted to exercise their hobby once in competition atmosphere.
Two top German junior drivers were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach and Linz came with the recommendation for good positions at the German Championships.
These two could, as expected, settle down from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish line and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was able to take second place again.
In the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team Nightmare, who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen came in second and third.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
This year, even more top athletes took part in the main race.
Four riders were able to get away from the regional leaders.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike half-pro from the Black and Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl was already two times world champion in twelve hour driving together with a teammate.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already has two German championship titles in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, an eyelash final came in front of the three lakes of the hall.
Pangerl was the first to race over the finish line.
Only one second behind that the experienced rider Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as third in the overall classification.
In the women ’ s classification Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen took second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to vote for the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation developed, which extended to his brain and there caused a hematoma, which would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it mature.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and drove with the tied up medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages, which need help.
Not always everything runs smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a banquet, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave - with its wide smile and its boundless energy - is gladly present at the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team will start examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per ride," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for school, but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team carries out simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the procedure the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is supplied by the group's generator and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an exhausting pensum, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum the whole night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with their work it brings a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a groin rupture that he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job he finances 60% of his charitable activity, according to Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteered to work in Bwelles group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations where we help to dump blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transport and the instructions.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
To help others to live a happier life and thereby fulfil a promise that he has given to his father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his metier, acting.
No one can pretend to the old man Santiago when fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
One almost thinks that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman boy Manolo speaks, can be seen.
When Santiago sits on the chair, bended by life, it is real at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his strength of will.
Janson is on stage as a solo performer on a large scale.
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea only consists of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he illuminates the active scene in each case: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie and Luise Gunst, who, with her songs and her splendid voice, sings about Cuba ’ s attitude to life.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewer from the Roman era is preserved at a length of about 120 metres below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass by the cathedral.
The two towers rise about 157 metres into the sky and make it the second highest church in Europe.
But few visitors, who admire the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.
The Cologne Tourism Service Center is the meeting point for its guided tours right next to the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage", says Schulze.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted a car-righteous city, and therefore from the remains of the old city wall only what was not too big remained standing.
Most of the users of the multi-storey car park pass the Roman remains and only park their car.
But those who look more closely discover an archaeological site separated by metal bars in the D2 park deck.
There are about five meters high ruins made of hand-held stones.
"The remains of the Roman city wall were built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper parking level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the President of the CCAA.
What CCAA means would like a visitor to know.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which in good German means" city of Roman right and city of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult ".
And the praetorium is the former statehood palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here on a length of about 120 metres.
"You can quietly walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After he got the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the ground water, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
Until today, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone in the Town Hall Square, for which construction work will begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass until completion.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of Rocker ’ s Process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous assault and damage to property against two 30 year-olds has begun before the regional court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The accused were silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and then to have belonged to the bandidos.
In June 2009, the public prosecutor ’ s office accused them of having pierced and beaten three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have listened to the competing group of Hell's Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently a chase with several cars had preceded.
According to the indictment, it was about fighting for revivals and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted at the beginning of 2012 in a first trial.
A court spokesman said at that time that it could not have been proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice annulled the verdict after revision of the Prosecutor ’ s Office and referred it back to the Regional Court for re-trial.
One of the accused is currently in open execution for another crime.
The prelude was mainly to the reconstruction of the procedures during the Tatnacht.
The Commissioner who was then investigating was invited to witness.
The focus was on mobile phone conversations between the accused and other persons who had intercepted the police.
It is difficult for Rocker almost always to abide by a law that is valid for her - and not to say so.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor's office Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that there had been new traces since the last trial.
Eleven other negotiating days are scheduled for the process.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What could be better than to drive to the next drive to treat yourself to a little bit?
I admit, I like to be part of it, if it goes late at night or early in the morning to fast food.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like going home and into bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goose make themselves noticeable.
Because what needs to be missing, that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Particularly on weekends there are discarded paper bags on roadsides and parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are the people too stupid to take the bags home or up to the next trash bin?
After all, it is not just that the paper machine is transforming the landscape.
Bags have also already covered transport facilities such as guardrails and thus caused accidents.
But about what is said "throwaway society" does not think about it, probably it does not even know what this word actually means.
If you are travelling more often in the evenings, especially with several people in the car, you know how a backseat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are towering there.
There would be a few more or less nix bags - in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to trample on the food remains of others.
I already see the day coming when the city and the municipality will be too stupid to walk around - and the fast food stores have to ask for a deposit for their bags.
Obama ’ s Repulsion in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama yesterday withdrew from his often repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of cancellation, the Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favourably than predicted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five per cent of the population who have signed insurance themselves would have to look for another tariff, because their contract does not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives' Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This statement by an aroused Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday ’ s hearing in the House of Representatives was received after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri about whether she should be obliged to attend.
After more than three hours of consultation, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged on the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce a state-sponsored insurance to conclude a tariff with HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia one day before.
According to CNN, the target was "rockets and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah.
The Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arabian channel Al and Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired on the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and that the Israelis were held responsible for this.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian defensive missiles of type S and 125 Neva and a battery of SA and 3 missiles could be seen, according to Channel 2 having a range of 35 kilometers and capable of transporting warheads of up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said, "We do not comment on these reports."
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben and Yishai emphasized that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver air missiles to Hezbollah earlier, sometimes successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that the US espionage has "gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated a softening of the US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage had "gone too far in certain cases."
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities became public.
The leaked information has pushed the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
Speaking via video at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "Without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned about some things that have virtually expired by autopilot simply because the ability to do so was based on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, on 11 September."
He then admitted, as the first high-ranking member of the US Federal Government, that the US Intelligence Service had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases this has gone too far."
The President is determined to provide clarity, and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one must have the feeling that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill, blow up, and attack governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, American legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on anti-terror efforts, as the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had been talking to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans stay on board in view of our joint efforts to combat terrorism," Murphy, who is the first democrat to sit in the Senate and chair the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their annoyance with the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies, although this week the head of the intelligence service said that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies had collected and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from Snowden ’ s forwarded documents that the NSA had monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other Heads of State worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and said that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of the Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members will be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact itinerary was still being elaborated.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have used for years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is planning a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away match of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is bred by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his mission in the short term," said coach Thomas Moreover.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal shooters with six goals.
After all, Mainz already has to do without the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian Appeals Against Prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming that she had been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after she had told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the shots of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to have conceived the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely worried" about his daughter's well-being and wanted to have her back in Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is open against a deposit of 50,000 Baht.
In Australian reports it was to be read that in the meantime she makes vacation in the resort Krabi in South Thailand.
It was heard from the court that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of the travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may endeavour to improve its proposed tourist image, and it therefore comes to acquittal.
