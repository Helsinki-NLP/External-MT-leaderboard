Welsh parliamentarians are concerned about the split
Some MPs are being discouraged by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has come about because of plans to change the name of the House to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the political system are concerned that it may make money off them.
A Labour MP pointed out that his party was afraid of the  that rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means split and pwp means shit.
A Plaid MP said the group was "totally disingenuous" and had explored other possibilities.
One member of the Conservative Party has said his group was "disappointed" by the name change, but noted that it was a brief spoken-word run from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is represented in the same way as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Senate, which is currently assembling the legislation to implement the name change, has ruled as follows: "The final decision on words to describe senators is, of course, taken by the members themselves".
The Welsh Government's 2017 by-law gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the committee announced the results of a general consultation on the dissolution, which said that the majority was in favour of naming the parliament a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the nomination of MPs, the committee was for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP option received the best support in a general consultation.
Lawmakers appear to be exploring other options, but the battle to reach an agreement could be a major pain for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legislative proposal on the changes within weeks.
The reform bill will also contain other changes to the way parliament functions, including rules on the disqualification of members and the deliberation of the committee.
Tax collectors cast lots for what they should be called when discussing the law.
Macedonians hold referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country should change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
It was decided to settle the dispute with the neighbouring Greek provinces of Macedonia.
Athens has long held that the name of its northern neighbors implies a claim to its territory, and has repeatedly been a candidate for membership in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will not vote in the referendum.
However, the referendum's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, insisted that the name change was necessary for membership in the EU and NATO.
The Bells on St. Martin's Square as Harlem Churches Fight
"Historically, the ancient people I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Lord Adam.
Today there is none.
He said the disappearance of the bars was significant.
"People don't socialize the same way these days", he said.
The children are no longer standing in the neighborhood, where people go regularly.
As for the churches, he is worried that the money for selling the land will not last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will be back where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with community governments, full of people who don't intend to help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy property in these buildings will be white", he said, "and they'll be hiding under the sun when these churches are stoned to death, because it's unlikely that more than half of these people who move into these properties will be part of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A swarm of people who had passed nearby overran the building.
St. Martin's was overrun by a black mob under Sir John Howard Johnson, who stood in front of a shopping mall on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or working for black people.
After a fire in 1939, the building was badly damaged, but as people in the employ of Father Johnson planned to rebuild, they erected the clock tower.
Lord David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, called the Lord's Bells "the bells of their poor".
The scholar who played on the July clock called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a priceless, historical poetic".
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also made sure that it was the first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell tower in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Lord Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and builders, some drawn in by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The church council - the lead in the lawsuit, which was filed by church leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with the sturgeon that the case wanted to try to get the costs over to the church council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and architects that the diocese had sent in.
Some in the attack complained about the lack of transparency from the bishopric.
A 13-year-old boy is killed while hunting lobsters in California.
A storm released a 13-year-old boy Saturday while hunting for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The crash occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been having coffee with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the turtle screaming for help, and then went with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but soon realized he was screaming, "I'm bitten!"
I'm bitten by a dog!
The skeleton was uncovered, and when Hammel saw it, he came over to the boy.
"I call to everyone to come up from the water", "There is a noise in the water", repeated Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of hawk responsible for the wreck was unknown.
Chief lifeguard Larry Giles had said at a news conference that a hail had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not considered a problematic type of hail.
Giles added that the ransom had been paid for the damage done unintentionally on the bull.
Officers closed the access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, due to security concerns.
Giles noted that about 135 species of hawk exist in the area, but that most are not problematic.
Sainsbury's is planning to move into the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's offers Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty walks manned by dedicated helpers.
As part of a massive takeover of the UK's $2.8 billion beauty market, and steadily growing as the fashion and home goods market falls back, the larger beauty trends will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented for several years to come, if it gets a good reception.
The contribution to beauty comes from wholesalers looking for ways to fill the hills, which were once filled with dishwashers, microwaves and appliances.
Sainsbury's has said it will double its range of beauty products to 3,000, with a brand now including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw for the first time.
The selection of products already available, such as LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees, is also being given more space by brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The wholesaler will re-emerge with the Boutique range of cosmetics, making most of the products vegan-friendly - something that will be highly sought after by younger businesspeople.
Following this, the fragrance retailer, the Fragrance Shop, will be testing out special prices in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon in South London last week, while the other will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and a shift to buying small amounts of food daily at neighborhood stores means that wholesalers must do more to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that retailers are becoming more like department stores, as supermarkets try to fight back against retailers Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has added Argos stores to hundreds of retail locations, and has also introduced several Habitat stores, after both chains were acquired two years ago, which is said to have supported the sale of retail goods and made the purchase even more profitable.
The first attempt by the supermarket to cover the health and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after discussions over how the revenues from the stores' pharmacies would be split.
The new plan comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m three years ago.
It was then said that Lloyds wanted to play its part in the plan with an expanded range of luxury leather goods brands, one now La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty walks to better serve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in skilled workers who are ready to help.
Our range of brands is tailored to suit everyone, and the enticing environment and convenient location enable us to be a true beauty shop offering the old-fashioned way to shop.
Peter Jones in the island after Holly Willoughby takes himself out of a deal worth £11 million.
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones is on the island after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to cash in on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their dress and the release date, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning, announced on Instagram that she was quitting.
Holly Willoughby has made the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, a smash hit, by stepping down from the lucrative lifestyle brand recently - to cash in on her new, unusually lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "on edge" when the TV executive at a heated meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of the trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5m - meant she no longer had time to invest in their property-lease brand, Truly.
The brand was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and was valued at double Willoughby's estate at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of his summer homes.
A source has said: "Truly was by far Holly's highest ranking.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would carry her through the next decade.
Her decision to kill herself stunned all those present.
No one understands what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to dawn.
On the main seat of Marlow is a full layer of goods ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of The Morning host, one of the UK's most promising stars, could cost the company several million dollars due to large investments in products ranging from codes and lighting to clothing and accessories, as well as possible delays before completion.
And it can end an old friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been married to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The couples travel together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes the brand ambassador for M&S and saves Ant McPartlin from hosting the show, I'm A Celebrity, on ITV.
A cell close to Jones said last night: "We have no interest in his business".
Hard to believe, we fell in love
He joked about the impressions he would get for coming up with what some consider to be Zhou's language and for being so fond of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump spoke with his arguing timeless voice.
I have not given up anything.
He added that Kim is interested in meeting again after their first meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a major step toward a nuclear-free North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June Singapore summit, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no "consistent" response from the United States to North Korea's initiated disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continues to pursue punitive measures to maintain trust.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions had died.
Now we have this good relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded good results - complete missile tests, rescued hostages and the return of American troops home.
And he kept his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but rather than 10,000 people outside trying to squeeze into this crowded hall, about 200 are standing right there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia Destroys one island, hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign multinational corporations learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
In many cases, however, they have been very determined that they do not need the full support, so it is a bit challenging, said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear that foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international companies are allowed to participate in the relief effort.
The persistent earthquakes in Indonesia leave the country sinfully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami waves are built in Aceh, they are not commonly seen on other beaches.
It is likely that despite the tsunami warning, the tsunami in Pali has claimed lives.
During the best seasons, it is difficult to travel between the many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make transportation even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
Joko Widodo, the president, made the transformation of the tailored infrastructure a major goal in his election campaign, and he has squandered money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of opposition has plagued the government of Lord Joko, now up for re-election next year.
Jokowi is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more traditional form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced, while Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets with masks, bows and arrows and other heavy weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores late in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 metres from the Chelsea goal, when the score was 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left before he hit a right-handed stick.
The experiment sailed high over the breaking ladder with the bull directly opposite the right corner of the net.
The ball failed to end up around a passing Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the net.
"I was just trying to get in my position, get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play behind when it's possible, so I was just trying to create the best time I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and move the ball, didn't think much about it and tried only one shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead in the semi-finals after a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue's midfielder returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the game before snapping and going full speed into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a one-two shot in the middle.
He then chewed a beautiful runner's ball, which led Hazard into the break.
Hazard ran from the back and shot into the back of the net with his left foot forward Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will represent Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on the wedding day in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster center reported early Sunday.
Many people were said to be trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale that struck on Friday and raised the age to 20 feet, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was devastated by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for the brutal murder of a woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they see or hear anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is well underway, but I would like to appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything malicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially rental car drivers, who may have been caught up in the investigation, to come forward, because they may have information that is of vital importance to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a fire.
Later, friends who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she had been found the morning before.
Investigations are ongoing and police say they are in the process of passing the information on to the victim's family.
A rental car driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to break into his apartment, but is told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was amazed at what had happened.
Now the locals know that it will be hours before they can enter again.
A policeman was heard to tell a man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came out of the city, weeping.
She keeps repeating, "It's so awful".
At 2pm there were two police cars inside the gate and another one just outside.
Several police officers stood inside the courtyard and watched the apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 using their alias and refer to file 247 as of September 30.
The emblem of Cromwell's Parliament is the last monument affected by the transcript history speech
The outward appearance of his Taliban would be a fairy tale of the destruction of so many English cultural and religious elements by his more progressive, puritanical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Lord Crick's vision as "transcendent" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It did not escape the current debate over the removal of statues that the creation of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster should become an issue.
The traditional resistance to the English Civil Wars was neither contained nor eliminated by Cromwell.
Possibly the skeleton of Cromwell was sacrificed for his great-grandfather, Thomas, made in the previous century.
The noble viceroyalty of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to the spirit of the nineteenth century and the historical legacy of a man who is still held by many to be worthy of celebration.
Lord Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph that: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the nineteenth century than today, as a protector of Parliament against external pressure, in his former kingdom, of course.
Whether it is a purely accurate description is still a matter of debate in the historical record.
One thing is certain, and that is that the war of the mid-seventh century has created a replicative civilization of our country, and Cromwell is a unique, recognizable figure who speaks for the other side.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Killing Pig Wounds Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was run over and killed by a pig in a market in the Outskirts, according to local media reports.
The man, known by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a worn body covered in blood near a fence in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to blow up cows in pigs on a pig farm May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his nephew from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead, and he found the door of a nearby stable unlocked.
He replied that in the pigs' cage there was a large rooster with blood all around its mouth.
A jurist bet that the 550-pound pig had wounded the farmer to death, according to the report.
The nephew's legs were bloodyly torn apart, the nephew, nicknamed Wu, said, Guiyang Evening News reported.
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am to feed his pigs.
The body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man had neither Yuan nor the nephew.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was hidden away to prevent it from leaking to anyone else while police collected samples on the spot.
Yuan's family and market officials deliberately agreed on a ransom for his death.
Although this is the case, there are examples of pigs being bitten by humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig had stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife came along and chased the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not generally good for you, but the taste of blood can be "helpful".
They're just jokes.
They're ignorant, very curious... they're not after you.
You'll just play with them with the utmost respect", he said.
The departure of the Pink Thief will bring a rain of grief to the landscape of the United States
The legend says that the Red River sinks as it moves over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Soon, Rosa will bring a flood of rain over northern Mexico and the landscape of the United States in the coming days.
Winds on Rosu were 85 mph, a Category 1 storm at 5 a.m. on Sunday, and were measured at 385 mph in a view from Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
The rose moves northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure sea turtle begins to take cover over the Pacific and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, like a tropical storm, it will push deep, tropical moist northward into the view of the United States.
Pink will come with up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture and the coming low pressure area will create a widespread rainfall in the coming days.
1 to 4 inches of rain in places, will cause river floods, garbage dumps and possibly desert landslides.
Deep, tropical wet rivers produce a rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of up to 2 to 4 inches is expected in areas of the horizon, especially over a large portion of Arizona.
Floods can occur and worsen rapidly, due to the speeding lightning of tropical rain.
It is advised not to go out into the desert for walks because of the threat of tropical rain.
Sometimes storms cause a storm, sometimes a hurricane, sometimes a storm.
The upcoming low pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to areas along the coast of Southern California.
Accumulated rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can lead to smaller dust storms and steep roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the country this rainy season.
Some forecasted tropical rainfall will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Stopping will accelerate to Four Corners Tuesday and lasts all day.
In October, large temperature changes can occur across the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder while the heat belt is still warm.
It can sometimes result in rapid changes in temperature over short periods.
One such example of a temperature change is in Central America on Sunday.
There are more than 20 levels of the monument in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build up and grow again.
Many places in Central and East America are expected to get a warm start in October, with temperatures rising to 80 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the country.
In New York City, temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above average.
The long-term study shows the outlook for heat above average across the whole of East America in early October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people watched the wedding day's sensational Supreme Court testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which allegedly took place in the late 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
Meanwhile, political equilibrium continued as embassies disrupted the traditional record Friday in the latest surprise: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to investigate the charges for up to a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had no doubt that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to get her out of a student rally.
Kavanaugh, in a burning testimony, said he had no doubt that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen said Friday, watched it.
The company counted the average weekly ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at offices.
By comparison, there's a crowd like that watching a football player at the finals or after the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the top of all broadcasters, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, under the day-long legal proceedings, Nielsen said.
ABC was next with 3.26 million subscribers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest in the justice system remained high.
Flake was the protagonist of the thrilling Friday event.
After the Republican's cabinet announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was spotted by CNN and CBS cameramen Friday morning as protesters shouted for him as he tried to get into an elevator for a court hearing.
He didn't look up, as he was for several minutes found severely beaten, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he speaks the truth to the land?
One of them said to him, "If you are, then many women are weak".
Flake said his cabinet had announced before the oath was lifted that he had more to say to the council.
The television stations broadcast live hours later, when the jury was to vote to move the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate for a vote.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI wanted to investigate the charges against the nominee before next week, which a minority of Democrats have called a deadline.
Flake was convinced by a few conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several senators later, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was decisive because it was clear that Republicans did not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the poll.
President Trump is under an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses inventors of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May blamed opponents of her decision to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with Britain's future and playing into the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, alongside her cover story, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, reiterated her so-called Chequers' Brexit plan, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's customs was "completely unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with manslaughter, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers sent out footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
The bail has been set at $350,000, the prosecutor explains.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department honors the Louisiana State Police's escape team, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "kindness and desire for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6'1" athlete grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played curveball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "for nothing" and "devastated" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcanoes spew ash in Mexico City
The gust of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano is night to the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Volcanology on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity began in the gossamer and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The city was undergoing several earthquakes and tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash being placed on the windshields of cars in Mexico City's suburbs, one of which is now Xochimilco.
Geologists have warned of an increase in activity in the volcano, which lies 45 miles (72 km) inland from the capital, after an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police break up with the Catalan liberals, ahead of the referendum.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after which pro-democracy protesters clashed with the unruly police, and thousands of people took to the streets of the racecourse to mark the first anniversary of the clownish referendum.
A group of masked liberators, held back by the police, blew eggs and powdered them, casting a dark shadow on the streets, which had usually been crowded with tourists.
Fighting also broke out later in the day, with the police having to use their batons to stop the fighting.
For several hours, groups of liberals chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" to the common people's cry "Live long, live Spanish".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the riots, local media reported.
Tensions are still high in the liberal country party a year after the referendum on October 1 was declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the liberation-minded Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become independent, although the turnout was low, as those opposed to the solution mostly boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were displaced last year after police, in fierce clashes, tried to stop the election at polling stations across the country.
Groups of liberals had camped out the night of Friday to avoid a confrontation with the police.
The dispute soon developed, but they had to go another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was at the protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the prospect of Catalonia's secession.
Last year we experienced one of the best times.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they couldn't vote, but now we're married.
Despite winning a small, if substantial, regional election in December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their lead this year, with several of their leaders either voluntarily exiled or in detention awaiting trial for their roles in organizing the referendum and the ensuing threat of self-defense.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone in support of the police, said the clash was brought up by politicians on both sides.
"It will get worse", he said.
On Tuesday, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since late last year, Oriol Junqueras, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the sponsoring government", he said.
Londonderry: But arrested after car crashes into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 arrested after a car repeatedly ransacked a Londonderry house
The scene took place in Ballynagard Crescent on the wedding day at about 19:30 BST.
Secret investigator Bob Blemming said damage was done to the gates and the houses themselves.
A bow and arrow may have been fired at the car.
Mena shot to give Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first appearance for Livingston secured the win
The Livingston promoters frightened Rangers into giving Steven Gerrard his only other loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Dolly Menga's case proved to be the difference, now Gary Holt's team moves up to equal Hibernian on second place.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a Premiership outright this season and will face Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna in the Europa League group stage.
Livingston, on the other hand, is increasing his unbeaten run in the league to six games, and head coach Holt is yet to try to lose after taking over from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston abuses opportunities against unsuspecting guests
Holt's team should have been ahead, long before they scored, as their reliability created major problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson switched in, but sent the ball in front and Alan Lithgow could only steer the ball forward of the goal, having slipped in to meet Craig Halkett's scorer in front again.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers have the ball, as they knew they could cause problems for the guests in de-ball positions.
And that's how the crucial issue came about.
Rangers made a free kick and Livingston found a hole, and after a collision between Declan Gallagher and Robinson came a substitution for Menga, who made a move and scored from the middle of the breakaway.
Rangers had kept the ball in check all game, but could not break through the stumps and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to do.
The Minstrel continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly out in a save.
Scott Pittman was dismissed with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot forward from a still-dead position by Livingston.
Innings were continually coming into the Livingston break and were continually being rolled away, while two requests for a break kick - one after a tackle by Halkett on the innings by Glenn Middleton, and the other before the ball - were waived away.
Successful by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
An excellent study and conclusion by Livingston.
They all seemed to be in a hurry, and they were hoping for the upcoming race.
Their style and manning have remained almost unchanged since their return to the top flight, but Holt is widely credited with the team's innovation since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The captain, Halkett, was strong in managing a well-organised defence, while Menga invited Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall off the field.
The Rangers, however, had little to offer.
As good as they once were with Gerrard as coach, they have failed them well and respectably today.
The final episode was lacking - they only managed to outplay the opposition once - and it's a serious warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the league.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were clear and blue clouds on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is intended to improve relations between NATO countries.
There is a danger of anger over questions of human rights, freedom of the press and the Turkish membership of the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkaland.
Police announced that security was the reason a crowd of 25,000 were prevented from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - were heard condemning Erdogan's policies, as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The controversy highlighted the divide between some German Turks welcoming a guest while others feeling bitterly for the same guest, as a homegrown person.
Deptford clash: Sugarcane died in collision with beer
A candy store owner killed in a car crash in London
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a remote road in Deptford, in a view of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the chariot stopped and the paralytic passed, but he died on the spot.
The collision comes just months after another shopper was killed by a fleeing driver on Childers Street, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police have announced that police are working to find the man's identity and to inform his family.
Road and bus routes are blocked and drivers are advised to evacuate the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers shaken in unrest
Six detainees have been released in a high-security prison amid unrest, the Prison Office announced.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30am on Sunday morning and is still ongoing.
Special Tornado police officers are called in to investigate the riot, which involves eight prisoners and is confined to one unit.
The police were treated first with small blows to the face on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison said: "Seriously, prison guards have been put in place to investigate the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers have been treated for their injuries.
We are not in a state of violence in our prisons, and it is determined that those responsible will be brought to the attention of the police and may end up in prison for longer.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most problematic offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the warden was being treated in hospital after being beaten by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to the prison to investigate a serious riot, where workers were shot with pool bullets.
The Red Hot Springs Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City With Floods
It's not uncommon for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Rosa turns its residual energy over the Desert Southwest, creating a threat of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, the landscapes of California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a short drive over Phoenix on Tuesday, and as she approaches late spring it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 20 tropical cyclones have been called tropical storms or low-pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ boundary.
The latest estimates by the National Hurricane Center expect 2 to 4 inches of rain, in places up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, one now in the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin can expect 1 to 2 inches, possibly up to 4 inches in places.
For those outside the river, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing, as the land is affected by turquoise.
Although flooding is a serious issue, some rainfall is expected to be useful, as it is so dry in the Southwest at the moment.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest rate, weather.com reports.
Starting with the Red River, it flows inland across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with a slightly sunny morning with winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north at 12 mph.
The storm meets the cooler Pacific Ocean and the tide is slowly decreasing.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico by the force of a tropical storm late Monday or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico is likely to be heavy, which is a significant flood.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California into the Sonoran Desert, with up to 10 inches possible in some locations, weather.com reports.
Rosa then moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, after which it moves north through Arizona and into the sunnier part of Utah late Tuesday evening.
The largest expected storm from Rosa or its remnants is a major rainfall in Baja California, the extreme portion of Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest, the National Hurricane Center reported.
This rain is expected to turn rivers into life-saving floods and sewers in the deserts, as well as mountain streams.
Midsomer Norton arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found unresponsive in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST Sunday morning.
He was taken to hospital, where he remains in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police have called in anyone with phone records to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "overwhelmed by the hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the irresponsible and shameful actions of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a conference in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump reported that Kavanaugh was subjected to the hatred and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on their wedding day, convincingly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had sexually assaulted her many years earlier when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about her preference.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw the evil, talented and brave Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to impeach Kavanaugh is a vote to impeach one of the most gifted forensic minds of our time, a detective with a distinguished record in public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia fans.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of a Republican rally for the midterm elections.
Five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I'm not going to lie, I'm really going to lie,' he said.
That's why I'm everywhere fighting for good candidates.
Trump wanted to be the Democrat in the ear to act against and prevent.
The first major vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising
At least 384 people were killed, many missing, and large swaths of the ocean washed ashore after a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
About a hundred people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when a wave of mud about eighteen feet high fell on the beach, knocking many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami waters came in yesterday, people were still active on the beach and did not flee immediately and thus became victims", said the spokesman for the disaster prevention agency, BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a news conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it knocked cars, trees, houses, it hit everything in its path, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open ocean at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before it hit the shore.
Some people tried to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
The disaster scene's frescoes show many ruined buildings and shops, broken and torn bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The sound of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) announced in a statement that the hurricane, which was triggered in Friday's massive earthquake, was about 200 times the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's land, which lies on top of a long, narrow ridge, may have made the tsunami even bigger, it reported.
Nugroho described the damage as "vicious" and said that houses, hospitals, supermarkets and guesthouses were razed to the ground in thousands.
Some bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were rescued and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties is likely to be higher along the 300 km (190 mi) long coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre.
The exchange was completely crippled with no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are on their way to the affected area.
"This is already a sad drama, but it can get much worse", it was said.
The library was hit hard on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although police officials said the tsunami had hit before the warning was issued.
In private recordings shared on social media, a loud man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people on the street below about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water washes up on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not exactly control the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it very difficult for authorities to communicate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending pharmaceutical planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but many evacuees still need food and other essentials.
The city's airport has been reopened, only for emergency purposes, and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, the president, was scheduled to visit displaced persons sites in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people killed by the Indonesian tsunami now exceeds 800.
It stands ill to.
While World Vision staff have safely arrived at Palu from Donggala, where workers are holed up in the shade of the presentation in the garden outside the office, they arrived at the devastated sites, Mr. Doseba said.
"We see many houses in ruins", he said.
It's in bad shape.
Even as the relief began the unnecessary riot, some complained that foreign, special assistance was being prevented from coming to Paul.
According to Indonesian beliefs, foreign funding, equipment and manning can only come if the place of misfortune is declared to be a national misfortune area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a national disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
If the governor says, "Okay, this is a foreign scam, we could open up for all the help, but nothing new yet".
Late in the evening in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing hope that their loved ones will be surprised to finish the silent march after the great disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of a cloak.
On Sunday, the rescuers found a woman who had been trapped under a rock for two days with her mother's body lying under her feet.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team in paragliding, had won two of the four games for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoner at the Roa Roa Hotel, the Lord Mandagi, was with him.
"As I've been able to navigate the parachute, I've got my own load of emotions", he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that in the hours after announcements were circulating in the paragliding association that Roa Roa Hotel was scheduled, he had sent a message on WhatsApp to participants in Palu who were at the beach festival.
But the orders gave only one tear fly leg and not two blue ones.
"I think that means that the order was not given", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 from a seawall in Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink employee while a suicide attempt was being carried out in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had waived a maintenance agreement and was planning to go after more money, secret police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
While he was building, another man ran up behind them and stole a bag of money from the servants.
Witnesses saw several bad guys running away from the scene, according to the inscription, but the police could not confirm how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their whereabouts should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been using the moniker, Ye, for a while and also used the name as the title of her eighth album, which was released in June.
The breakthrough comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He is coming for singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the program for "personal reasons", the creators of the program said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current occupational name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, when he was announcing the album title on the radio platform, Big boy.
So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It went from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye -- a reflection of our good, our weak, our desolate wholeness.
The flag is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many rappers to have changed names.
Sean Combs has been known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has also completed with or without binding and capital letters.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against ordinary citizens, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody act of revenge against a reader.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never in my life use the military to beat down the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student protests were taking place in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has given his word to support young Mexicans by giving monthly scholarships to readers and opening several public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw youth to criminal cities.
The United States doubled its commitment to artificial intelligence (AI).
As China becomes more active in research, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says top research investor Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several in the U.S. government made similar announcements, even though the U.S. as a whole has no firm policy of such.
Meanwhile, China came up with its plan last year: it aims to be a leader in sustainable innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for smart grants would be a good start, because all the other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we're still looking for a decisive step for smart grants", Lee said.
A doubling of the funding could potentially double the chances of the next big real estate deal being made in the United States, Lee reported in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is a director at Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most widely held venture capital firms, Face++.
In the 1980s, he was at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked on a quiz that won against the best American actor in Othello, and later became head of Microsoft Research and head of Google in China.
Lee acknowledged a previous U.S. government competition, now the Defense Advanced Research Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one was coming up so he could see the next thinkers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win public research, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders; it's the practices", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been getting big money from universities to work on intelligence in the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also be beneficial to the United States, to support the experiment with intelligence.
"I think that the work and living permits themselves should be recommended to people with a doctor's title in a sensible way", he said.
The State Council of China has announced its White Culture Plan for the Next Generation in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions, similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together participants from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
In contrast, the NSF is currently investing in research worth $100 million a year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia went to a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has prevented membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a separate state called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has denied membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposal, but nationalistic opponents point out that the change will destroy the national unity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
Gyorge Ivanov, the president, has announced that he will not vote in the referendum and an attack on the communication ban has cast doubt on whether each subdivision will meet the minimum requirement for the referendum to be legalised, which is 50 percent.
The question on the ballot is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the ratification of the agreement by Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, registered with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that this is what is needed to push for accession to councils such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means we all have a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not required by law, several members of parliament have said they will consider the outcome of the election and make it decisive.
The name change requires two-thirds of the parliament to approve.
The state election commissioner said that nothing irregular had happened at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I have come to vote for my children and our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and son Dushko, have voted in favor of changing the name of the country and thus opening the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared to make a small platform and high chairs for tents, which are being erected for those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go prepared, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we are respected.
If they don't want us to be like Macedonia, we can go to other countries, like China or Russia, and be part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will add to the many investments needed in Macedonia, where unemployment is higher than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote for it, because more than 80 percent of our population is for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after announcing his vote.
He said that a yes would be uncertain for the future.
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters took part in the referendum - less than the required sub-count.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of those polled were going to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
For the referendum to be valid, the submission must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western-led government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero runs through all of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly took the defence of Brighton in the 2-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine runner received a mid-range transmission at the start of the race.
He went through three Brighton defenders before running free on the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green droughts.
He went ahead of a defender and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's breakaway.
He sent the ball to his left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward sent his first nerting back to Aguero, who used his right-arm off-break to send the ball ahead of Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some leg problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about letting him play for 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored accurately then.
However, it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue lead in the Premier League game.
That speech came in the 29th minute.
Aguero then got a ball deep inside the Brighton half.
He sent a beautiful run-up ball down the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane did some nerding before he led Sterling against a hand-to-hand stance.
The army blasted the ball into the tongue just before he left the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to use the Brewers against the Rockies
With the Nationals now unable to reach the endgame, there was no need to start over.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but if the Rockies can make the playoffs, they're one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies secured a wild-card spot with a 5-2 victory at the Nationals on Friday night, but will still try to win their first division title.
Even if we don't play for anything, we can at least throw, knowing that the crowd in Denver will be good and that the other team will definitely play at the highest spot I've met this year.
Why should I not be a contender?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will start Sunday, but reports are that they are willing to allow Scherzer to throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who can start for the 34th time, throws on his wedding day and throws on his rest day if he starts.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's address in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of a Republican rally for the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is going to be shot in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
This is one of the big ones -- I'm not running, I'm really running, and that's why I'm running for good candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, awful expansion of the Democratic caucus, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back with all the necessary risks, you see the unclean wickedness.
They don't put anyone in the position they need to be in to get power and authority, it's what they want, power and authority, we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are eager to act against and prevent.
And you'll see it after four days, he said, and he called the Democrats cowards and haters and filthy and unholy.
He pointed to the judiciary in the Senate, and named the Democratic senator, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which caused the audience to shout loudly.
Do you remember her answer?
Do you have the body document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, oh no, I'm waiting - it was a very bad massage - the worst massage I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a church
It does not negate the meaning of those who speak it.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted for my dissent, it was no surprise.
By the way, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs to know that we are not welcome - everyone to express their opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way when she consistently fought anti-Semitism.
In my case, the outcry came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a rational economic policy, about national security, about Europe, about the peaceful cooking, these are questions of the same kind that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders about.
The report from the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, stated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and creative.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the convention meeting on Friday night was just that.
However, the tone is not that way at many meetings now and the promise of a "terrible, polite" policy long ago is forgotten, if it ever began.
It has been consistently made clear that dissenting views are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged out if they are favourable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues who I thought shared a political viewpoint with started expecting me to push back and have views that I would never have otherwise agreed with -- one on national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a stream of gossip on social media that screams dissent, blames the policies of the Labour Party and says I shouldn't have been in the Labour Party.
And that's not my experience at all.
I am far superior to some of my fellow workers, because the accusations against me are political.
I respect the professionalism and moderation of those coworkers who face gross sexist and racist issues every day, but never give up.
One of the greatest hopes of this era of politics is how common approach has become.
Jeremy Corbyn last week demanded that the Labour Party build a culture of tolerance.
The fact is, we are no longer the broad church, and with all the misunderstandings or rules regarding electoral reforms, the party is only narrowed.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years, which encouraged me to do little, not say too much, and that I would explain a lot.
But that's not what I'm in politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government and its neglect that had broken down my big-fingered classroom, I've tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a city councillor or a minister in government.
I've never changed my politics, not even for the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political position, including disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the notion of mistrust on Friday, I can only say that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I didn't see the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party chairman.
But my message is not really to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am committed to serving you and I trust that no threat of dissent or political self-interest will deter me from working for what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr goes to the top
Two late goals may have made the final score a bit skewed, but there is no doubt that Ayr would have picked up the victory in this entertaining match in Tennent's Premiership today.
They are now top of the standings, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end it was as much the sturdy defense as their better allocation of chances that carried the home team, and coach, Peter Murchie, had good reason to be satisfied.
'We have been attacked in our battles, and we have not yet won. I can only rejoice.'
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Thanks to Ayr, they took the chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, translated by Frazier Climo, sent Ayr on the bench, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, released for the match from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggot scored a non-translated goal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a break kick before he, just before half-time, scored and converted a one-man goal to make it 17-5 to Ayr in the standings.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, translated by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long stop, due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field on the chest, and when they started again, Ayr came further ahead after a score by Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climo.
Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, was given the yellow card and once again Melrose was outnumbered by a man in the overalls, with a non-imposed score by Bruce Colvine, after a hefty push.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to thank Climo without a ball, MacPherson went all the way from the penalty line, hitting a leading Ayr team.
Climo reversed, which he did almost immediately after Kyle Rowe got the kick from David Armstrong and sent off winger Gregor Henry, who scored the team's fifteenth goal.
Still Game star ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry after it emerged he was named CEO of a reputable restaurant company
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he writes and stars in with long-time screenwriter Greg Hemphill.
The partners announced that the ninth installment in the series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is getting ready for a life after Craiglang.
According to the general charts, he is the head of Adriftmorn Limited.
The viewer refuses to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to be part of the "flourishing restaurant" movement in Glasgow.
"The lake is ours": embedded Bolivia hopes that justice will open the way to the Pacific again.
Seamen are in charge of the raincoat-wearing seaport in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with a navy blue flag.
Lakes from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: The lake is our right.
To get him back is a duty.
Everywhere in the interior of Bolivia is the memory of a beach lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century invasion, still alive - the longing to sail the Pacific again in the same way.
The hopes are probably as high as they've been in years, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of torture.
"Bolivia has a sense of unity and honor and is expecting a good result", said Roverto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look to the International Criminal Court's decision on the big issues surrounding the country, with the hope that the Hague court will opt first for Bolivia's insistence that - after a century of unstable negotiations - Chile is committed to negotiating an independent opening to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the native-born, charismatic president of Bolivia - who faces a contested re-election next year - will also be called to the polls on Monday.
"We are very close to reaching the Kyrra Sea again", he promised in late August.
However, some commentators believe that it is unlikely that the judiciary chooses Bolivia - and that little will change if it chooses.
The ST parliament of the Netherlands does not have the power to hand over a Kilen area, and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's decision comes just six months after the last grounds were given shows that the case is not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than continuing the story of Bolivia, the last four years have probably made it even drier.
"The question of access to the sea is overridden by the current situation in Bolivia", Zárate said.
Morales's military rhetoric has willingly taken away the remains, if anything remained, dismantle it.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again sometime, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after this.
Both countries have not had ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, pointed out that the court's thinking was unusually fast.
Monday will be a "metallic opportunity" for Bolivia to enter into a new relationship with Chile and a chance to end a 139-year-old dispute with the joint chiefs, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still a well-respected Latin American president - used the Navy as a political weapon.
"Bolivia is about to give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
The decision gives us the opportunity to see that we must base the past.
North Korea has announced that there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can rely on the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the general meeting of the ST.
He urged the United States to keep its promises, which they made at a meeting in Singapore among the world's leaders.
His comments come on the heels of reports that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to begin the use of static nuclear weapons more than three months after Singapore's Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a cynical space that continued confessions and U.S. claims to an announcement that the Korean War is over will someday limit North Korea.
Washington is wary of a deal on disarmament unless Pyongyang makes significant changes to its disarmament policy.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang will actually disclose a disarmament that the country has asserted as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another Kim-Trump meeting.
Fashion shows in Paris unveil the latest line in grand masterpieces, which are on their way to your main boulevard.
If you want to stretch your collection of hats, or completely stone yourself in the sun, look no further.
Snipers Valentino and Thom Browne uncovered a slew of crazy, oversized headgear for their SS19 lineup at the chain show, which blinded the style that was set on the Paris fashion scene.
There have been some very unusual hats all over Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their exhibited models up after the chain move.
Valentino's particular outfit was an overly determined, gray-brown hat adorned with a feather-like, large shadow that filled the heads of the models.
Other exquisite treasures were a now-ornamented watermelon, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple - but they were not made to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of self-portraits in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have recessed warts and remind more of Hannibal Lecter than fine scrub seams.
The first of the living creatures was like a scorpion, with horns and spears, and the second was like a melting pot.
And if you keep looking at the big fashion ads, you're in luck.
Fashion experts expect that the eye-catching hats will soon be found on many main streets.
The unusually large hats come in the halls of La Bomba, the two-foot-tall shadow-wearing hat seen on everything from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the unkempt hats, which was ubiquitous on social media, has also led to another, large creation on the chain - a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model who wears it.
The yellow-brown wooden bag, with a fringe and white leather handle, was the most prominent piece of the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus at the Paris fashion show.
Celebrity makeup consultant Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer - now that makeup has had such a big impact, it will be hard to shy away from the demand for oversized lotions".
John Edward: Measurement is critical for global citizens
The Scottish Free Schools have maintained a record of academic excellence and have continued in 2018 with unusually good test results once again, which are only reinforced by good results in individual and team sports, lists, music and other team events.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best services for their pupils and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their career choices and their status as global citizens.
As a department of education that can shape and shape a curriculum, we see more modern languages being chosen as subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he knows, it goes to his head.
If you lie to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone, but we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's test results, we see that languages are at the top of the list of highest percentage of countries that are tested in free-schools.
In all, 68 percent of students who read a foreign language scored the highest.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored highest in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who spoke German, 69 percent of those who spoke French, and 63 percent of those who spoke Spanish also scored high.
This shows that free schools in Scotland are accepting the importance of foreign languages and that children and young people will need them in the future.
Objectives as a subject are now considered on par with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and statistics) in the curriculum of free schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills study found that 17 per cent of employers' reasons for struggling to fill vacancies were related to lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
Now that more and more future jobs will require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Unlike some people's career path, it is only a benefit in their future to have learned a foreign language and thus a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries puts a polyglot person ahead of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only spoken language to have a double-digit percentage, at 15 percent.
That's because investing in language learning is now important for children.
Knowing more languages, especially those spoken in countries with an educated economy, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, the language taught varies from school to school.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important for the UK, with a view to 2020, one now Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there is always a wide range of subjects to choose from on a free scale, with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools work centrally to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with skills that are guaranteed to deliver outstanding results, whatever the future entails.
It cannot be denied that in a global trading environment, languages are still very important for the future of a country, so this should also be seen in schoolwork.
Modern languages should certainly be considered as universal communication skills.
Free schools will continue to offer these choices, opportunities and examples to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron ready for his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James get his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the regular season game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, the exact number of minutes he will get is still unknown.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James' season would be limited.
After practice earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six training sessions.
"I don't need any training at this stage of my career to be ready", he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Donald Trump, the president, is launching a series of meetings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned meetings Trump will have next week, including stops in the welcome locations of Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the threat of his election to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court rising, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing power in Congress in November.
Trump's meeting is coming up in West Virginia tonight and how are you browsing the net?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can stream Trump's meeting in West Virginia live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to discuss the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court this week, a position strained by allegations of sexual misconduct, with a Senate ruling suspended for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this round of meetings is to help Republicans get to the November election.
So Trump's team has announced that the five meetings next week are intended to "boost volunteerism and support", as Republicans try to defend and increase their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Violence in Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach a critical time", a spokesman for Trump, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling this evening is expected to draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage in Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time in less than a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican nominee for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is dragging in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president will have to come and reinforce him in the election campaign", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows a fighting spirit to keep the hopes alive ahead of the singles games Sunday.
After three days of the other side talking, the two-on-two game on Saturday night was probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the leaders is a perfectly developed concept in sports, but it is one that athletes believe in firmly and firmly, and never more so in competitions like these.
So who has the advantage?
"They were ahead by six points, and now there are only four, so I think we have a slight advantage at the moment", said Jordan Spieth, as he approached the end of the day.
Europe is obviously ahead, with four points to go and 12 to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel they have a bit of wind in their sails and they have plenty to back up underneath, not least the pace of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can stretch themselves by three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been extremely problematic from the first shot to the flat around the hole and going on the bench.
The barbers' cheers intensified as they rounded him, where he took an important shot and tied in the fourth game, after he and Thomas were two behind by two strokes.
The puck who won the match on the 15th hole was celebrated with similar shouts, the kind that warns you that he doesn't think the American team is out.
"You just have to dig deep and think about your own game", said Spieth.
It's all these players are after now.
18 holes to set your sights on.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unimaginable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's ambitious and thoughtful couples have four out of four and can't go wrong.
Mollwood was the only pair not to shoot a late bogey on Saturday, but they also managed to shoot a late bogey on Saturday morning, late on Friday morning over the final nine holes on Friday morning.
This move, despite the way the hurricane seems to stream both to and from the viewer, confirms that they are the ones who will win on Sunday, and the only well-regarded players who could possibly confirm a European victory, now that the sun is setting on Le Golf National, are Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
There is not much talk about European honor, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly eliminated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the Spanish four-ball game this morning, when he was playing Alex Noren.
A bow and two doubles on the first nine, dug the Spaniard and the field down into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
On Sunday, though, no one is going to help you out of the hole.
Both the two-player and the four-player games are so interesting to watch from a short distance, because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a plan can change in the moment.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and is well on its way before the final day, but these two games have also shown that Team USA has a war mentality that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe at 10-6 before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe dominates ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup after they exited the four-ball game on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspiring pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, went on to win two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods and thereby lift their record at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to recover the brick they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, had dominated against a failed American team in the four-ball match in the match tomorrow, losing 3-1.
The United States was more resistant in the doubles, winning two matches, but failing to narrow the gap.
Jim Furyk's team will have eight points in the 12 individual events on Sunday to recover the steeplechase.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollwood", after a successful weekend, are only the second pair to have won four points from the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball match, they played well together and defeated Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau on a single lap with an even more decisive 5&4.
Woods, who tore through two games on Saturday, showed a broken major, but he has now lost 19 of 29 matches with four goals in play over doubles, and has lost seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested this morning for the four-goal games in play, returned to his teammate, Henrik Stenson, in the doubles with a 2&1 loss against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world number one and three.
The European team, however, did not get everything it wanted on a nice, relaxing day in a view from Paris.
Triple winners of major championships Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas tied the American record by two points on Saturday.
They won a thrilling 2&1 victory over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball match, and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the double, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from four points behind before the singles, although Furyk's team, which won last year, needed only a draw to recover the steepest.
After being second best for two days, it is unlikely that they will be able to return on Sunday.
North Korea says 'no' to disarmament alone without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued confessions increased mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility that the country would abandon its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had made "significant goodwill" moves in the past year, including ending nuclear weapons and missile tests, removing the nuclear test status, and giving its word of honor not to increase the amount of nuclear weapons nuclear technology.
"But we have not seen any similar response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, neither can our national security be trusted, and under such circumstances it is not appropriate for us to disarm first alone".
While Ri repeated well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a "scale-out" approach to disarmament, where North Korea had been rewarded step-by-step, his account seemed to say that they did not reject the single-step disarmament Pyongyang had undertaken completely.
Ri referred to a joint statement given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work toward a "de-armament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the allegations of linking harsh, global actions against North Korea.
The US is firmly on the principle of disarmament and increasing the confidence of the confederates to achieve their goals in a necessary way, and is even against "declaring an end to the war", Ri said.
The idea that the Yankees can bring us down is a wishful thinking of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued confessions increase our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a new Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister also pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the problem of disarmament came from South Korea and not the United States, then the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as tight as it is now".
So famous was the tone of Ri's voice, which was completely different from last year when he said at the ST General Assembly that it was not safe to say that the mainland of the United States was targeted by North Korean missiles after the "evil" President Trump called Kim a missile man with a suicide plan.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely disarm" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work remained to be done and that concessions must be made before North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it's the same".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should have recognized Pyongyang before taking action.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on the day of the ceremony that "forcing the Security Council's confession must continue extremely and resolutely until we see a complete, final, verification of disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased its recognition of North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to curb Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile ties.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the ST summit and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and claimed that progress was being made before North Korea within hours charged him with having requested a "criminal demand".
North Korea pledged, at a meeting with Moon this month, to take down a missile base and a nuclear facility if the U.S. conducts a "coherent strike".
He said Kim told him that the "continuing conflict" he wanted was the security assurance that Trump had promised in Singapore and moving toward a more normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new program at Harvard University this year has been giving its readers more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing self-imposed human habit of reading through caffeinated "all-nighters".
One academic warned that students at the world's top universities are often completely clueless when it comes to taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the procedure, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to do the course after he had given a lecture on the effects of insomnia on learning.
Finally, one of them came to me and said, 'Why was it that nobody told me this until now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The survey, which was first offered this year, explains to students from the mainstream how good sleep habits help academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve well-being and well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health department, said the university chose to introduce the program after warning that students were severely sleep deprived.
The one-hour course covers a series of collaborative tasks.
One section depicts a typical room where students rely on coffee cups, curtains, shoes, and books and are told about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance is affected by insomnia, as well as the importance of a sleep break.
In another section, students are given a report on how long-term insomnia can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, stroke, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then prompts the participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it's not going to change student behavior directly.
But we think they have a right to know - just like you have a right to know about health risks when you choose to smoke", added Prof. Czeisler.
The feeling of pride in staying up all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing emphasis on students makes insomnia a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough sleep, good sleep, should be the loyal weapon of a student to fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety - even to avoid taking it up, he said - because insomnia puts the brain in a state of starvation, and makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies physiology and biochemistry, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he took a class with him last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the Faculty opened his eyes and inspired him to try to get a Faculty for the whole university.
The next step, he hopes, will be to get students on the continuum to complete similar courses before they enter competitive institutions.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students put an alarm clock on when they should go to bed, and one when they should get up, and be wary of the effects of blue light emitted by electronic skins and LED lights, which can make your daytime clock unstable, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Score of Gerrard's first-class century
Rangers once again suffered a disappointing outfield result when Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking for their first away win since a 4-1 defeat in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side managed to give Gerrard just their second defeat in 18 matches as manager, leaving his side eight points behind relegation rivals Hearts, who have gone on to strokes in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The score was tied at seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' set-up, without inspiration, never looked to level.
While Rangers now drop to sixth, Livingston moves up to third, tied with Hibernian, only with a worse record.
And there could be more trouble ahead for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury that apparently cut off an outfielder's leg.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that faced Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, started with the same 11 who had stepped up from Hearts last week, and he has been overwhelmed by the way the well-oiled team has crushed the opposition every chance they get.
The Rangers may have had more on the ball, but Livingston did more with it when they had it.
They should have scored two minutes later, when Menga with the first nerting sent Scott Pittman off against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder abused his big opportunity by shooting forward of the goal.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found the captain, Craig Halkett, but the defender, Alan Lithgow, was only able to shoot forward of the right-handed stump.
Rangers came to dominate the field, but there were obvious hopes rather than faith in it in the final third.
Alfredo Morales considered he had a broken kick after one short when he and Steven Lawless faced off, but the referee, Steven Thomson, waived the Colombian's plea.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was badly hit by Lassana Coulibaly's scorer and a line shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's speech after 34 minutes may have been against the course of play, their efforts made it undeniable that it was a complete failure.
Again, the Rangers failed to get a clear shot at a long free kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who initially set up Menga so he could easily shoot into the goal.
Gerrard made a change in position when he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change had almost an immediate impact when the winger put Morelos up, but the frugal Kelly played out of line and blocked.
But Livingston continued to get the guests to play exactly as they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett rowing long balls away time and time again.
Holt's team had doubled the lead at the end of the game, but McGregor was well on his way to denying Jacobs before Lithgow sent a scorer ahead of goal from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton also had a claim for a break kick tangled with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger
Now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and that TALER --- the day the future alchemist, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in his home in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of preserving and measuring radiation activity, an invention that led to the toy being known as the Geiger meter.
A major part of science since then, the Geiger-Teller also became a widely popular part of popular culture in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, starring the two scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is the name of this?"
Rogers: This is a Geiger detector, used to find radioactive rocks, one of which is uranium.
When you are in this key layer, you can hear the effects of the atoms that radiation in the rock layers gives off.
Evans: "Tell me, now it really melts!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New treatments for cancer can teach the immune system to spot unpredictable symptoms.
New vaccines for cancer can teach the immune system to detect unpredictable cells and kill them.
Coagulation teaches the opposing immune system to recognize unpredictable cycles as part of the treatment.

They can see a protein that's common in many species of crabs, and then they can break it back in.
A summary of the trial shows results that give hope to patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who had the contraceptive that teaches the opposing system to recognize unpredictable genes saw the ovarian crab she had been holding for more than 18 months disappear.
This human body contains resistant proteins from a patient, including modification of them in the laboratory so they can seed a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and then re-inject the proteins.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising coagulation.
This is the case in many types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, reported Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking opposite-functioning kidneys from patients and teaching them to mimic cancer has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West went on the run with an unprovoked pro-Trump charge, in a MAGA KEPPI, following his SNL presentation.
It Wasn't Right
Kanye West was booed off stage during Saturday Night Live, after an unprecedented performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he planned to run in 2020.
After performing his third song on the evening, titled Ghost Town, where he was in a Make America Great contest, he began to confront Democrats and resumed his support for Trump.
How often do I talk to a white person and he says, "How can you praise Trump if he's racist?"
Yes, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the evening with a game show with Matt Damon, where he made a return to Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the jury regarding the sexual assault allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, recordings of West's performance were posted on social media by the show's creator, Chris Rock.
It is unknown whether Rock attempted to anger West with his report.
West also had angered the audience that he had been treated harshly in the back of the hand for his top gear.
They beat me behind the pole.
"Don't let him go out in a rage", they told him.
They bit me!
And then they say I'm in a deserted place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the empty city?" He said he wanted to hide in the cloak of the hero, because that means no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Test the love.
His comments prompted at least two cries from viewers, and SNL actors looked upset, Variety reported, with one person saying in the article: "The whole station was a mess".
West was hired as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-sheik, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was much disappointed with his performance of the song I Love It, when it was included as a Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative party, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SETTING ME UP against HARCALIDM".
But the host of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing.
But I decided not to be jealous of anyone's music or clothes or artistic achievements, which would cause me to spread a message that would be harmful to my fellow Christians.
He is free.
And so are we", she added.
Prior to the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now veran, formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His co-rapper, Snoop Dogg, has been called Snoop Lion and not to be confused with the music hero Prince, a soul who changed his name to symbolize the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east end of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear in the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges are prosecuted by the public prosecutor.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, is found to be poisoning human flesh.
Kit Harrington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's horror, medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor finds himself in the conventional image of the macho hero, and says that such roles on stage make young boys often think they have to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that "things have gone wrong" and asked how this problem of poisoning humanity under the #MeToo movement could be solved.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has "strong feelings" about the problem.
"I think personally, especially at this time, where did we go wrong with humanity?" he said.
What did we teach people as they grew up in the trouble we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increasingly toxic male sexuality, because of the large number of male characters.
"What is the law? " he asked". What is the teaching?"
What is taught on television and in the streets that young boys think they have to be that way.
I think that's really one of the big questions now -- how do we change that?
It is obvious that something is wrong with the young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be making any episodes or continuations of Game of Thrones when the show ends next summer, adding that he is "likened by walls and dust".
From November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor also recently revealed that he thought the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this mission, and in many ways it gave me my future family, and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning psychological thriller.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases were carried forward by sexual intercourse, a change from previously.
HIV usually spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of contaminated blood flow.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been cut to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a news conference in Yunnan province.
Yet year after year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Further transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a major concern in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, surveys estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The reason for the continuation of the disease is often the lack of insurance in these parks.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised public access to HIV treatments as part of the effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff have dated Republican senator and charges problematic lies and conspiracies
U.S. Attorney Maxine Waters has condemned allegations that an employee of her office has posted personal information on the Wikipedia pages of three Republican senators.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the preference was controlled by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information was reportedly the current addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information leaked online on the wedding day, by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, during the Senate's racially-abusive impeachment trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
But it came some time after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the listing was linked to Waters' office and sent out information about one of Waters' employees, Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely untrue and nothing but lies", Waters continued.
My employee - who was given his body conscience and personal information and whose security was compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - had no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
These baseless accusations are completely untrue and nothing but lies.
Waters's message quickly gained traction on the Internet, including from former White House communications secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The denier is full of rage", wrote Fleischer.
This indicates that she has no intention of being a member of Congress.
If they were accused of wrongdoing, they could not be found guilty.
They can't start.
and they could not answer my accusations.
and to teach quiet and self - controlled behavior.
Fleischer seems to compare Waters' response to the Democratic sentiments about Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too mean in his trial on the wedding day.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if it's appropriate", he tweeted.
In her report, Waters said her office had reported to the authorities and police about this unfair treatment.
We want the perpetrators to be found and brought to justice for the harm they have done to our brothers and sisters in Judea.
Johnny English Strikes Again commentary - Rowan Atkinson without the mockery of a spy parody
It's now customary to look at the Brexit implications in a new British-made film and that seems to be useful in this revival of Johnny English, action thrillers - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is self-satire, said in a low voice, about how little we benefit from being given new opportunities for export for the country?
In any case, the outgoing, flat, unassuming Johnny English has been allowed to ring in it once more - and even his name indicates that he is a broad scheme-builder made for non-English film audiences.
He is, of course, the mischievous, secretive spy who, despite his false attempt at glamour, recalls a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a bit of the rabbit feather, which with a singular note helps to set the Chariots of Fire theme to the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the international, adventurous traveller once played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements that turned everything into chaos.
There are a couple of good moments in this new YOU movie.
I loved when Johnny English approached the bull in a medieval armor and the bull's feather briefly flashed against his helmet.
Atkinson's gifts of making physical sketches are shown, but the song feels a bit unnerving and unnecessary at times, especially when the "heavyweight" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, have now also run with sketches.
It feels like the plot is more for children than adults, and I don't think Johnny English's crazy misfortunes are as inventive and mediocre as Atkinson's finches in the silent movies as Bean.
The theme that is repeated over and over again is that Britain is in big trouble.
A computer crook has infiltrated the top-secret network of spies, exposing the collusion of all British spies in the division for fear of one of the spies on the mission - a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw of a prime minister, a creature of the past that's already been torn apart because of his political reputation: Emma Thompson does her best in this quasi-Teresa May role, but there's not much to work with in the script.
Her conjurers tell her that since all spies are out of control, she should call someone out of the loop.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who's now the principal of some fine school, but secretly teaching the kids how to be spies: something really scary is going on here, one of which is that English is offering a spy academy like the School of Rock.
English is sent off to Whitehall for a crisis and is reunited with his long-suffering ex-partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a rival leader, a brilliant, shady role, with Vicki Pepperdine a bit played out.
Batman and Robin of making everything perfectly crooked for the freak show of Her Majesty are back, and stand over the beautiful lagnokende Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being chased by the charismatic tech billionaire who insists he can solve Britain's computer problems: the criminal Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their troubled journey with a senseless scheme: dressed as servants, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create a commotion when they sneak aboard Volta's marshal; and English unleashes complete lawlessness when he tries to use a gun-like headset to identify Volta's house.
All the steps of the journey are uncertain for the final stage, but the smoothness and the level of it, it resembles quite a lot a child's play.
Pretty awful stuff
And as with all the Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his abilities?
Labour denies that they are working on a plan to get Britons to work four days, but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is reviewing a proposed plan to get Britons to work four days a week - but get paid for five.
It is said that the party wants corporate executives to use the savings from the AI crash to give employees a day off.
For workers, this meant that they could enjoy a thirty-hour week - but still get the same pay.
Some say the idea fits well with the party's economic agenda and puts the country in the workers' favour.
A four-day workweek shift is approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: "A political statement is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This is not done in one day, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits well into the work of the class to restore equality to the livelihood of the worker, in addition to the class's overriding plan of diligence.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such a proposal after the Green Party tried to bring down the working week to four days during its 2017 election campaign.
The draft is not fully endorsed by the Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to point to his views on a socialist economic collapse.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to win back power from no-confessionals and ockers in the exploitation industry.
The shadow chancellor's estimates also mean that existing waterworks shareholders may not get all their shares back, as the Labour government intends to make cuts after what they consider to be illegal actions.
He also opposed plans to put workers on the boards of companies and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds, to provide 10 per cent of the share capital of private companies to employees who are eligible for an annual profit of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about how the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final decision on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether a meeting of the Commonwealth's legislative branch could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could possibly find anything that would have caused them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his fellow South Californians.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said before the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, after this happened, the accusation came, I said, 'Who did this?'
He was the most stable, determined, and could not be misunderstood.
Graham's vote, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be changing.
"I'm clear about Brett Kavanaugh and it would have required a powerful indictment", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it outright, put Graham back, and whispered to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all those who are called by her cannot know it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new that would change it.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has It Done Anything To Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a brilliant lineup of performing stars and an equally brilliant theme: ending global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people who line the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to experience performances by the now Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to shine a light on the true purpose of this event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is organized by the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free membership to the event (unless you'd like to pay for a VIP membership), people who attend concerts must complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or otherwise doing something significant to help shine a light on the goal of ending poverty.
But how good has Global Citizen been 12 years after it launched?
Is the idea of giving people a free token a real way to convince people to shout a warning, or is it just a new form of "click-through" - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online protest or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million actions from its contributors, who have contributed to a variety of causes.
He says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce pledges and assurances worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of 2018, the forum has come out with 390 leaflets and information derived from its actions, with at least $10 billion already laundered or collected.
The organization estimates that the secure money has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most notable achievements include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and promoters committed to helping children reach their full developmental potential, with a pledge to provide Rwanda $35 million to end child poverty in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With support from the UK government, donors, governments in other nations, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice and malnutrition a footnote in history. The Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracey Ullman told audiences at a concert in London in April 2018.
The conference also said that after more than 5,000 applications were submitted, with calls for the UK to improve maternal and child delivery, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will feed 5 million women and children through the upliftment of nutrition.
In response to one of our website's questions, "How do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes it will fail.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the names set to perform at this year's event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman in the starring roles as hosts.
US likely to use navy as a "defensive" to slow Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can use its military if necessary to prevent Russian energy from ripping markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's activity in Syria - especially where it is at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an exception to exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like in Eastern Europe, the healthier hub of Europe", he said, after all.
And, according to officials, there are different ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, prevent, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization called the Voice of the Energy Consumer in the United States.
He began comparing Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were largely the same.
"The economic opportunity with Iran and Russia is largely just to control and replace fossil fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a country that only has one thing to do and is financially tied to fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has been focused on increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, rather than Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
Meanwhile, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "dangerous" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is nothing more than a hostile project.
The Kremlin insists that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons, and that it is an example of unbridled competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure reduction and that consumers should be able to choose their own hosts", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's thinking has given Germany a critical understanding, having otherwise waived its new obligations to the project.
Germany's leading industrial company, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from ST's energy policy, including the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third state taking over our energy sector", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said at a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Hugsa Gjølla About Running for President in 2020, Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she will consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the House of Commons in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren bet that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and get the message of the broken government and that means high-ranking women", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will reconsider whether to run for president.
Warren mentioned his opinion of President Donald Trump in the House, saying he was running the country on a crooked bull.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our people", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll released on the day of the wedding, on the other hand, shows that a majority of Warren's voters think she will not run in 2020.
Thirty-five percent of "real" Massachusetts voters said the senator would not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the proposal.
The election results showed a higher support for a nomination by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names mentioned in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a final decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin performs Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump conference
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with a burglary incident last night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's home, makes me understand other families who are aware of the effects of PTSD, including how injured some of our veterans are", she told the audience at a Donald Trump conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul referred to his capture as a "public disaster" but no one did anything. He told his son and other soldiers, "They're coming back a little differently, they're brave, they're coming back thinking if it's honorable that the joint army, the navy and all the other soldiers have given the country
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, and lying about a domestic violence report, as well as carrying a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support challenge to new peace-school policy
Eight states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories filed a friend-of-the-court lawsuit Friday in Washington to support a political truce petition, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the Commonwealth policies is not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner and his violent sons, who were part of a gang, had raped her, but U.S. officials denied her request for a peace bond on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace cited El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a high number of peace school applicants in the United States, as countries with serious problems with urban and housing security.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who fled their homes to apply for asylum,
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "forests for decades of state, commonwealth and international law".
The common law requires that all appeals for peace be judged on the sole facts and circumstances of the appeal, and such a prohibition violates this principle, which is stated in the Friendly Court's writ.
Prosecutors further criticized the bill's policy of denying immigrants entry as damaging to the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "need essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Peace schools are for those who flee their homeland as a result of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy briefing.
The Peace School was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious problems -- that people have every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to save Paul, now double the number of dead in trying to find escape.
For those who escaped, the situation became increasingly dire.
"It feels very old", said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, as she nursed her leprosy-ridden son in a refugee camp in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute the ambulance comes with the bodies.
Clean water is self-sufficient.
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, trying to save anyone they could find among the drowned and stranded.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals were badly damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake on Richterstagen.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who has broken her spine and her sciatic nerve, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the continuing aftershocks.
His eyes widened as he described the feeling of the tremor on the fifth floor of the guesthouse where he, his wife, and his daughter were staying.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was crushed into what was left of the walls, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town for a getaway.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she was killed.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "threatening" with "pagan" descriptions
A week after a Chinese-language newspaper published a four-page report in an American newspaper that halved U.S.-China trade ties, the Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the paid review of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to influence the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. election is a sign, U.S. officials told Reuters, of a new shift in Washington's election strategy to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to make declarations to try to stimuli sales, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has resulted in higher tariffs on imports from both countries.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to discourage immigrants in states such as Trump's Republican-backed Iowa, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing is taxing American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "strengthens the chance of printing propaganda descriptions in our own free press".
"By spreading its propaganda, China abuses American values, free speech and freedom of the press, by printing descriptions in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, in the newsstands down the street here in Beijing, you can find limited, broad voices and no real thoughts about the disparate opinions that the people of China may have about China's difficult economic situation because the Communist Party of China controls the media", he wrote.
He added that two of China's most prominent newspapers declined an offer to publish his article, though he did not disclose where the newspaper was.
Republicans Challenge Female Voters Before the Midterm Election With Kavanugh's Failure, Warning Greens
While many senior Republicans are waiting and defending the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, amidst the racial-criminality accusations, warns analysts that they will experience a retreat, especially from women, in the run-up to the midterm elections.
The sentiment that lies outside has been overwhelming, and most Republicans have already said they are in favor of a vote.
These issues cannot be taken back, said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts whether the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) in the twelfth hour to get an FBI investigation will be enough to squeeze voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and they won't forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the nonprofit organization, MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" while protesting in the Senate chamber, while Republicans, who control the Judiciary, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and participation will be fine", Stu Rothenberg, an unembedded political columnist, told the news site.
Some say it has already been raised, and that is true.
However, it may be higher, especially among swing, female voters in the overseas and younger electorates, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not admire the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she reiterated her accusations of racial bias against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts expect a reversal to follow if Republicans continue to threaten.
"This has become a hurricane of the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the House of Representatives vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets a seat as a judge, it's about how Republicans have handled this and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed to the news release.
However, Americans seem to be divided on who to believe, according to the reports of Frod and Kavanaugh, with a small majority choosing the latter.
A recent poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of those who asked said they absolutely or absolutely believed Ford's reporting, while 35 percent said they absolutely or absolutely believed Kavanaugh.
In a poll, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or probably lied in the report, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a tip from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges and at least one additional charge, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian, reported.
Ford testified under oath before a Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh, while he was in custody, released her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her gender at a bargaining session while both were studying law at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web (WWW), starts a start-up company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech hero, Intrupt, is a project based on Berners-Lee's open platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored in addition to which people have access to which information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee speculated that the Inrupt effect is "worldwide".
"We must do it now", he said of the work.
It is a historical moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal database online or a POD.
It can include mailing lists, to-do lists, calendars, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all on the same shelf at the same time.
What is special about online privacy is that it is up to the user who can access each information.
The function refers to the personal authority method via data.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the project manager, John Bruce, is that the project can provide a platform, approaches and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The project is currently being developed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, some contracted employees who develop the project along with a team of volunteer programmers.
This week, technology developers around the world will begin to build their own cross-platform apps using the Inrupt website's free tool.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they're coming up with a complete change where all their business models crash after one day.
We do not ask permission from them.
In an article on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the goal of Inrupt  is to provide a trading power and a system that helps protect the cleanliness and goodness of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee reimagined the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a key voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even now, after Berners-Lee created Inrupt, he remains the co-founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest who received the Victoria Cross in World War I, celebrated
The only priest in the English Church to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a war hero, was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Priest Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the battles of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper's bullet four days later, unaware that he had won the British highest decoration for bravery in battle.
A memorial stone was unveiled by both his abbots for a sculpture in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Another abbot, Michael Vann, said it was "extraordinarily imaginative" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the monkey's award-winning taste.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Vann led his division across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through thick fogs while they were shot down by cannons and machine guns.
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with extraordinary courage he led the line forward before single-handedly running over a cannon and shooting down three of the other troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the monkeys were "unpleasant, which I knew I could never live up to, but something humiliating".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also placed a wreath behind the sculpture, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt honoured to be a part of the cast and added that the courage of a true hero is proven by the support that many people will give.
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you've been waiting all night to see the stuffed Bellator 206 and you're denied the main part.
The San Jose episode contained 13 battles, including six on the main screen, and was shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6pm, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the UK audience was surprised when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were surprised to have waited until the early morning, especially for the battle.
A Twitter user described the shift to childcare as a "fucking salary scam".
"There were government agencies that felt the content of the program was not appropriate at 6 a.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's television", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's deputy director of marketing and communications, said when asked about the content.
Peppa the pig, yes.
The director of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were working on their file so that UK witnesses could also see it in the future.
"I think that when I think about the depth, we can figure it out". Coker said.
But it is six o'clock on the morning of the Sabbath, and we cannot unload it until our time on Sunday, the Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was split up, many sent messages and they were not all friendly.
We tried to explain it, we thought it was a technical fallacy.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We cut it down to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give the guys too much and we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic athlete Tom Daley said he started to feel inferior because of his gender - but it inspired him to achieve a good result.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he started high school that girls aren't like me.
On the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, with host Lauren Laverne, he said he shed light on the rights of gay people to give other people vones.
He also said that being a parent made him less likely to win the Olympics.
The regular host of the old show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
As a commentator on Laverne's first episode, Daley said that he felt inferior to everyone else as he grew up because it was not socially acceptable to admire boys and girls.
He said, "Today, these feelings of weakness and variation are what give me the motivation and strength to succeed".
But Peter wanted to prove himself insane, so he did not deceive everyone.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, he has become a strong advocate for LGBT rights and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking of this because he knew he could live openly without consequences and wanted to make other promises.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "shocked me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
When you go through so much in your youth - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had gone through the same ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, giving birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his views had completely changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have turned out that I won a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger events than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
The son shares the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had their own access mark for London 2012 - because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be here, old man.' "
I held his hand and he died. But before he died, I thought he was no longer alive".
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about all my life - to compete in front of my home crowd for the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated in the build-up to the Olympics and even gave him a gospel team.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-training Mickelson on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets the record Sunday when he plays his game No. 47 in the Ryder Cup, but he has to get going so it doesn't become a physical milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the tournament, which is either year, for the twelfth time, beating all records, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk for the doubleheader and four-ball game on Saturday.
Instead of being the centerpiece, as he has so often been for the Confederate States of America, the five-time winner had to split his day to be more active and work on his game on the field in the hope of getting back on track.
He has never been the one to be high-legged, not even when he was at his best, and the 48-year-old doesn't fit right into the Le Golf National stadium, where the long-haired part always punishes calculating shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces Sunday's ninth-round British Open winner, Francesco Molinari, who along with new Tommy Fleetwood has won all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind before the 12 individual medals, get a good start, then Mickelson's game could be very decisive.
Furyk trusted her husband, as he could not say much else.
"He knew his role was complete today, he hit me on the back, he hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He's very self-confident.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's done so much for this team before, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw that he was going to play more, but that's the way it is and that's the way we think we're going to continue.
He just wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that never had as good as his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18, lost 20 and drawn seven, but Furyk says his presence gives the team something undeniable.
"He's funny, he's eaten, he's funny, he's a lot of anger, and he's a good guy to have in the armoury", he explained.
I think the younger actors had fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He brings much more than just playing
The leader of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that great leaders can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a fairly large lead before the singles matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unforgettable experience.
The Danish team was awarded the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros, with five points, but managed to win only with a very small margin, beating the Americans 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remind yourself of the great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but only accurately", said Bjorn, dismayed after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, so they are now at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story shows me and everyone else in the team that it's not over.
You have to go out with everyone in the morning.
In it, all things are right.
This is not finished until the steps come to the count.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this corner, and that is why we must come together.
I've always said that I'm going to stick with the 12 players in our squad, but we know what's on the other side of the table, the best players in the world.
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a ring golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't think too far ahead in this.
Tomorrow it will be uncommonly difficult.
Tomorrow, it's the seed of one, the seed of another.
It's nice to be out there with a partner, when it's going well, but when you're out there alone, all your skills are put to the test like a golfer.
These are the rules you must teach your players to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now the bride is going away, and she is going to get her share of the business.
In contrast to Bjorn, opposing team captain Jim Furyk would see his players as much better as individuals than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great quarrel on the last day, when he was part of a winning team at Brooklyn before ending up as the loser when Europe won what is now known as the "Wonder of Medina".
"I remember every condemned word of it", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had spoken to his players before the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to get a good start, just like we saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When it goes the same way, there is a lot of emphasis on the hatred of the middle parties.
So we made preparations and sent them out as we could, hoping to make some money tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with starting the race and meets Rory McIlroy in the top fight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I chose this team in this order because I think it fits all the way through", Bjorn said of his personal selection.
Germany's new cruiser is still once again delayed.
The newest frigate in the German fleet was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace older Cold War warships, but it won't be until next year due to lack of systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate fleet, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was to be commissioned in 2014, but problems with the deployment plagued the large-scale project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will, of course, have a powerful cannon, a host of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and the ability to become unseaworthy, a now limited radar, infrared and acoustic capability.
Other features are longer lay-off times - it would be possible to commission the newest frigates for up to two years away from home.
However, the continued delays mean that the newest warships - which are said to be converted to German power abroad - will be decommissioned once they are in service, Die Zeit points out.
The ill-fated F125 frigate came to the fore last year when the German Navy refused to commission it and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipyard.
The reasons for the dispatch were uncertain, but German media reported several significant defects and malfunctions, rendering the ship useless if sent into combat.
The need for programs is particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet will be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen frigates.
Later, it was found that the ship was too heavy, which would sink off and limit the ability of the fleet to make future incursions.
The 7,000-tonne heavy Rhineland-Palatinate is expected to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the project - the recorded training of the man - is also a problem.
It is said to have reached as high as €3.1 billion ($3.6million) - from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are particularly significant due to recent warnings that the German fleet's strength is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense department, admitted that the navy is actually reducing the number of ships that can be deployed.
The official said the problem was exacerbated by the time the old ships were taken out of service, but no replacements were made.
He was also angry that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates were able to make it into the fleet.
The Nature Conservancy is looking for the secret lives of bats
A new study on a fire in the Scottish Peninsula is going to show how flying mice use land in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the result will be groundbreaking in the behaviour of the unique, flying mammal and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the Scottish Nature Conservancy follows the common and sopranos, including a brown owl and the Daubenton flycatcher at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed on key posts around the property to monitor the operations of the pilot throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out portable tests with handheld handrailers.
The precise acoustic analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species do what.
A housing map and report is then made to create a detailed picture of all the landscapes and their behaviour.
Rob Dwear, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which sites are most important to fly mice and how they are used by individual species.
This information helps to determine the benefits of cultivating sites, a way to make grasslands and how to best manage forest land for flying mice and other introduced species.
The supply of flying squirrels in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by buildings and outbuildings, which affect sleep and loss of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also be a hazard, as can airplane paper and some chemical preparations of building materials, including cat litter.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of the night-time hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes, when it comes to catching.
They use advanced technologies of echo verification to locate insects and insects in their nests.
NTS, which is responsible for the removal of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant parks and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, is considering flying moss.
There are ten water experts who regularly conduct examinations, overseeing rest stops and sometimes rescuing.
The organisation has already established the first and only nesting area for flying mice in Scotland at Threave and the Dumfries and Galloway estate, where eight of the ten flying mice species in Scotland live.
The forest leader, David Thompson, says that the forest is their model area.
"We have good farms here", he said.
We have old houses, lots of old trees and very good farms.
But there is still a lot that is unknown about flying squirrels, so the work that is being done here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to thrive".
He emphasizes the importance of testing for flying flies before building inspections, because it is possible that an unintentional destruction of a particular resting place can kill up to 400 females and young, possibly removing an entire, closed establishment.
The birds are ravenous, and they are not allowed to kill or harm or to disturb or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish board member of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said: "We have much to learn about our flying foxes and with so many of our species, we just don't know how they are doing".
Ronaldo again shows accusations of harassment, while prosecutors make clear to target German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has described accusations against him of sexual harassment as "false stories", and says people "want to stigmatize themselves" by using my name.
His prosecutors are ready to target the German weekly Der Spiegel, which dropped the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus midfielder is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have bribed her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on the wedding day.
In one Instagram Live broadcast to his 142 million followers, just hours after the charges were announced, Ronaldo, 33, said the stories were "false".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they said today was a lie. The five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or entered the statue.
They just want to glorify themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but that's part of my work.
I am a happy man and I am well", he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's prosecutors are preparing to target Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have called "an untruthful message by the attacker in a personal area", according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schultz said the actor would seek compensation for moral solutions in a number of cases related to the crime, possibly one of the most serious violations of personal liberty in recent years.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the actress's bedroom, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the incident and told her that he was 99 percent a good guy, but that no one percent had let him down.
The records suggest that Ronaldo bet that they both had sex, but that it was with their consent.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and photographs of her injuries were taken at a hospital, but later she came to an out-of-court settlement because she felt fearful of motorcycle accidents and was worried about being completely humiliated.
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to appeal the decision, as she is still terrified of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a move to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the match was due to take place, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: UK to regret losing its currency
Britain will regret it forever if it loses its status as the world's leading oil producer after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the trade minister.
He added that it was "horrific" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays on the market in the event of a no-deal Brexit could be costly.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Community.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Burnaston executive.
Other British carmakers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade over the dark will reign, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says now that the Mini plant in Oxford is shutting down for a month after Brexit.
The biggest fear is what carmakers say are problems in restaurant chains, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's supply chain is built on an "up-to-date" basis, with parts arriving every 37 seconds from suppliers in both the UK and EU to pre-owned cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be unrest on the border, which the insider said could lead to delays and shortages.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to have more than one daily inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production is halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "newly set to prevent the cross-border investigation".
"We need to get a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not just to enjoy good results now, but to take the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The test, not only from Toyota, but also from other business owners, is that we must be able to continue what has been a restaurant chain with very good results.
Toyota could not say how long the production would stop, but with the future in mind, it warned that the cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and thus cost more.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the Unite faculty there, said that his members are the constant steward. From what I've experienced, I know that if these great ones leave, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an urgent and consequential plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, White House announces
Much is at stake in Donald Trump's meeting with the attorney general's deputy, Rod Rosenstein, and now he may be delayed for another week as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will run for attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's integrity, has been debated in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein changed his mind about having a decoy on him to record interviews with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president at the 25th Constitutional Convention.
Rosenstein denied this.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, despite the announcement that he was going to testify.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for the wedding day.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to run Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed due to a conflict with the Senate Judiciary, where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into a week-long indictment of Kavanaugh, which delayed a Senate vote even further.
Trump's middle-ranking aide, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosentine meeting, she said: "A day is not yet fixed, it may be this week, but I expect a delay of a week, because of all that is going on in the Supreme Court".
But we'll see, and I like to keep the mediators informed.
Some sources question the preference: Sanders has not had a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders responded that the controversy over the press conferences was not due to dislike of the television newsmen who were doing it, but she said, "I'm not against them actually doing it".
She then predicts that communication between Trump and the media will increase.
"The president makes more S&Ss than any president before him", she said, without providing any evidence. "We've tried to match the numbers".
"There will be more press", Sanders said, "but since the media has the opportunity to ask the president questions directly, it's often better than talking to me".
We try to do that often, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to replace the conference where you can talk to the President of the United States of America.
Trump regularly takes questions when he leaves the White House or is part of open meetings or press conferences with visiting officials.
Having informational meetings alone is selfish.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why when he appeared with no restraint and in a strange manner before a packed press conference.
Health minister writes to EU NHS Scotland staff after Brexit fears
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter, less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to reduce the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the public sector.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "For many summers, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have been ongoing, and hopefully decisions will be reached.
However, the UK government has also taken a keen interest in preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it's a very difficult time for you.
I am to reward every individual for his work, regardless of race.
Partners across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and are viable for patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie Is For Surgical Treatment After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercbrombie has been treated for a concussion after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, coach Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came out on the other side of the line and just fell there", Reed said.
Doctors and nurses administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before lifting him onto a stretcher and taking him out for further examination.
An employee of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was screwed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still "younger reports" about the nature/size of the damage and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, redshirted in his second year, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he had to leave the match, which raises the score to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme
The bridge will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The stamp duty is levied on non-taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects it will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The bid is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success by attracting young voters with promises of more abundant housing and higher wages.
The stamp duty cut will be levied on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the cut will stifle the government's efforts to combat heavy sleepiness.
The rent - which is added to the current stamp duty, taking into account the senior citizens who moved in two years ago to house number two and buy-for-rent - can be as much as three percent.
The Finance Council expects the change to generate upwards of £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new housing in London is purchased by non-British residents, which causes prices to rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "households" because so many foreign buyers spend their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering the poll tax to help young people buy their first home.
He charged large building companies with keeping the price of property high by buying land without using it, and urged Mrs May to get rid of quotas on plentiful land to gain a better understanding of the housing boom in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of eye-popping housing deals, with a now rent overhaul and an end to evictions for no reason.
He also wants to give municipalities more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to re-inventing the British dream - to make life better for every generation.
And that means understanding the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is so easy for non-residents of the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses as permanent British citizens.
For too many people the dream of owning a house is gone, and the devastation of deep sleep remains all too real.
Jack Ross: "My highest priority is to coach Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "highest priority" is to coach Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old shooter takes the challenge to rebuild the North Easterners, who are currently in third place in League One, three points from the relegation play-offs.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B match and that was it", Ross told BBC Radio's Sportsound.
But growing up, I would often look back at Scotland at Hampden with my dad and it just killed me again.
Of course, the only way I can be successful is if I manage a team.
Ross's former teammates at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he felt no fear of following such names in such a big club, and had previously denied any involvement with Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League".
The structure and conditions of the club make it undoubtedly home in the Premier League, he said.
For I do not see that my coming to you is a gift for nothing, but I see that if I am admitted, my work will be fruitful.
Ross has only been head coach for three years, after a spell as assistant coach at Dumbarton and part of the Hearts team for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa secure relegation to the third-tier, and re-established St Mirren to fight for relegation to become champions the following season.
And Ross says he feels better fit than he ever did in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He knew that it was a cross, but he remembered and went on to the Alley of the Cross.
I really did not consider it right for me to serve, much less to play.
That's a lie, because I was doing well, I was able to make a living out of it, and I had some big upsets.
But it can be hard to play.
You're going to go through many weeks after weeks.
I'll still go through it, considering the strength and the conviction of the work, but leadership is just right.
I always wanted to be a coach, and now I am, and I feel like this is the best thing I've ever done in my adult life.

The best time to drink a beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, study says
The summer heat wave has boosted the income of struggling inns in the UK but put even more pressure on restaurants
Hospitality and bar associations saw a 2.7 percent increase in July - but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent, figures reveal.
Peter Martin, from the trade consultancy CGA, which calculated the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the same pattern as June, when the income of hostels grew by 2.8 per cent, but restaurants were hit even harder.
The after-hours growth of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Hospitality and bars, which mostly sell beverages, fared much better and their success was greater than the return of restaurants.
Hospitals, which mostly sold food, also spent time in the sun, though not as much as restaurant owners.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
Over bars and restaurants, sales of beverages rose 6.6 percent that month, and food fell three percent.
Paul Newman, from the leisure and hospitality industry, RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social and sporting events are the biggest concerns when it comes to sales in the overseas market.
It is not surprising that food markets continue to struggle, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be painful in addition to the ongoing cost relief.
Long, hot summers could not come at a worse time for places selling food and time will tell if the modest heat that has been in August will be enough to supply the air space needed.
The cumulative growth in sales of inns and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating the ninetieth move of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pub, bar and restaurant industry in the UK, collects and analyses data on the markets of 47 partner organisations, with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is the industry's hub.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some under the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, reveals the questionnaire
A survey of 20,000 high school students
These reports have raised fears that sexual content will be uncovered
Twenty percent of the students said they had a high-risk drug, which they showed to their parents.
One in five children - some under the age of 11 - establishes social media users whom they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students reveals a huge increase in fake Instagram users - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
These reports have raised fears that sexual content will be unlocked.
Twenty percent of the students said they use a quick-and-fast app that they show their parents while they have private apps.
A mother who came to her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a 13-year-old who asked others to "take me down".
The survey, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of free schools, showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two users, with half of them admitting to having private users.
HMC Director, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is disturbing that so many teens are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle is the Speaker of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle is elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an independent non-executive director at the annual meeting of the Board.
Doyle is the most decorated shooter in the sport and chairman Ian Beattie described the change as a great opportunity for those running the sport to exploit her extensive experience at the international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in the Scottish, UK and international freestyle sport community and we are confident that freestyle sports in Scotland will benefit greatly from her inclusion in the committee", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to act as a voice for the fans, and I hope I can really give my contribution and help the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, along with four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on BBC, is no longer able to walk after suffering a brain hemorrhage.
He tweeted: "A month ago today, I had a brain hemorrhage.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how well I would do.
It's been a lot of hard work, but I've come back to myself, I've learned to walk, and today I've done some gentle exercises.
Thank you for the supportive note!
Breast pump descriptions compare mothers to cows and opinions vary online
A breast pump effect has been popularized in the Internet with a description comparing breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows.
As a preview of what has been called the world's first soundless breast pump, the consumer technology company Elvie released a food-related image reminiscent of an eyeband to showcase the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a high house with a crush to a song, one of which now has the words: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no hawk" and "If you didn't know by then, this is not a cow, it's my beard".
The bottom line is, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm giving these pints, pump it out, pump it out, I'm giving my mother milk".
But the description posted on the project's Facebook page has sparked a wave of online chatter.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the film has received mixed reactions from critics, many of whom say it understates the dairy industry's problems.
It's a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be raised on the way and fed to produce milk, lest their children be taken from them a few days after birth", it is written.

Another commented: "Sparking is frightening for both mother and child".
But yes, why not use them to light a breast pump for mothers who are deprived of their babies?
Others added: "A lamp in the distance".
Others turned the lights off, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was obscene.
I think this is a very good idea.
I would have one if I had a brother.
Pumping made me feel exactly like a squeeze.
The explanation is a bit vague, but I took it for what it was.
This is a very good product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a short description for mothers who pump (often for work or on the table) and feel like cows".
This is not a complimentary explanation or a condemnation of the milk.
At the end of the film, the group of women reveal that they have danced with the still-standing pumps tucked into the breastplate.
The idea behind the curtain is based on the fact that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is a pure brick, has no pipes or tubes, and fits still in a breast holder, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go outside while being pumped.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and creative director of Mother, noted: Elvie Pumpan is a revolutionary product that has managed to get off to a rocky and challenging start.
By comparing women giving to cuddling, we wanted to put the breast pump and all its challenges in the spotlight, while presenting it in a fun way that women can connect with, and show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has been on the cover.

Hundreds of refugee children quietly move to a tented market in Texas
The number of withheld refugee children has increased, although the monthly number of crossings is partially unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it harder to get sponsors for children.
Historically, most sponsors have themselves been immigrants without the necessary documents, and have bothered to risk their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and accepting a child.
The water rose in June when Commonwealth photographers announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with immigration photographers.
In recent weeks, Matthew Albence, an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested countless people who sought to sponsor isolated childbirth.
The agency later determined that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or members of the household of a sponsor are here illegally and a large number of them are punished foreigners.
So let's keep chasing those people, said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to get to the children faster, officials have come up with new rules requiring some of the schoolchildren to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than the 60-day standard for undercover workers.
Many will attend a conference call rather than attend in person to defend their right to legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for service are quickly expelled from the country.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to be feared or intimidated, which can lead to extreme neglect or attempted escape, according to the workers in hiding and the reporting that has emerged from the system in recent months.
Prosecutors say fears of such a situation have been heightened in a larger area, such as Tornillo, where signs indicate that a struggling child is more likely to be circumcised because of the noise.
They added that moving children to the camp without enough time to prepare them emotionally or allowing them to say goodbye to friends can make the soullessness many are already struggling with worse.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish Air Force to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the General Assembly of the UN, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext that they were fighting the aggression and that they were being treated unfairly.
"They must leave the country immediately without conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to be besieged with the Holy War until all the territory of Syria was cleansed of both the rebellious and any illegal foreign force.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return, and blamed some Western countries for the "excessive fear" that influences refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and aid agencies to make these returns easier", he said.
They make speeches that should only be human problems politics.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no resettlement aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats in the ST say a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement halted a massive flow of Russian-backed Syrian troops into the territory of three million people.
Moualem, on the other hand, noted that the deal had "significant flaws" and raised hopes that military action would go to the jihadists and also to the Nusra Front fighters who have been linked to Al-Qaeda, who are going to "be destroyed".
ST envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to prepare a post-war Syrian referendum and a snap election.
Moualem placed conditions on the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work should be limited to "assessing the points of the current system", and warned of "incitement".
Why Trump Will Win a New Shot
Logically, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal thinkers hope, the treason charges end his presidency too soon.
Of what will undoubtedly be the most exciting end of a presidency ever!
There are now no signs of hygiene.
Since 2014, the number of prime-time viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops the list with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"This is like a fire that people are driven into because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet minister who becomes president after a Capitol building collapses.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
She recalls a trip by rental car in Boston before the 2016 election.
The captain told her he was going to pick Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, 'Because he makes me flee,' Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a maintenance value in the red body.
However, unlike anything else on television, the move from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be reunited and the health of the global economy.
The burning of many is the counsel of the hypocrites who are righteous.
And yet, you're more than an informed citizen when you're watching yourself at six o'clock after a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sources for his book, "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 strut jacket, and the hints of Stormy Daniels's inadequate descriptions of, um, Mr. Trump's building.
I'm going to see Super Mario, the one I've been tormenting.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like reality TV is he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about changing players and daily pitfalls of the NFL history (choosing to fight against the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked in and watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't look away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was running for the Senate Judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we all did the hat-trick posts back then, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western culture,' Lord Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a bit of a joke, but it turned out they were right.

Money from abroad is being used in a tight midterm election
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th District sees a rush of money, as a reorganization of a congressional district ended with two officials vying for the same seat.
In this newly-revised Pittsburgh precinct, the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, is running - having won his seat in another instance in a special election of our last one.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is heavily circumscribed by the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old rules were unconstitutional and favored Republicans.
The race for the new 17th District has started a bitter financial battle between the party's major rivals, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a landslide victory in a March special election for Pennsylvania's highly-anticipated 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won by 20 points.
Political experts expect Democrats to have the difference.
US Tried to Reprove El Salvador for Supporting China, But Withdrew
Government officials were wary that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in July 2017 and was at a guesthouse in Panama before the owners of the two Trump Organization executives left.
State Department officials chose to recall U.S. diplomatic officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "new decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the council, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only deliberate against El Salvador, which reportedly received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for arms control, development and financial support.
The alleged sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on immigration, had been devastating for the Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic progress to follow a similar meeting last year, which was intended to be a step forward in efforts to prevent migrant workers from traveling to the United States.
However, in mid-September, officials at the highest levels of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed and finally end the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the summit, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the presidency places on the summit, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new, harsh orders or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the comments by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic concerns without naming names.
Their reports were confirmed by an anonymous expert close to the pledge, who did not name the person.
Read the history
The next thing that cannot be overlooked is the report by the special counsel for the police, Robert Mueller, about the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, where there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
It is rumored that Mr. Mueller is turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's election campaign had anything to do with Russia in the run-up to our election.
If Congress were to pass on other hands, Mr. Trump would be held accountable in the Senate, just as he is preparing to return to voters, and possibly a jury of his peers.
It's going to take a lot, and I don't mean to rush Mr. Trump's downfall - nor his European counterpart's.
Decisions will be made by everyone on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the war.
In 1938, German military officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to escape the years of killing that followed.
The judgment for such a change is swift, and the impunity of the people is delayed or delayed.
Americans are facing many of these turning points right now.
What if Mr. Trump drives the deputy attorney general's agent, Rod Rosenstein, the man who has been at the forefront of Mr. Mueller's investigation home?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since the paper reported that he had secretly sought to impeach the president last year and had speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story in The Times is untrue.
What do we do if the newly-opened FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or ready - or if he is challenged in the Supreme Court despite the religious accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to the midterm elections to vote for a congress that will give Mr. Trump the responsibility?
If we ignore these trials, the winter will be long for the people.
But based on what I learned in Prague, I don't expect us to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that once ran my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath on a rabbit table with a hex cross.
If this is my legacy, how can I not be sure of our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers before Rapid Vienna match
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna's birthday knowing that a win over Austria, after a spectacular draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a good position to advance from Group B of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first start of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he expects Rangers to use that result as a prelude to something bigger.
"It was a good step for us because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We have run the race of faith to the finish.
We might have gotten it last, but overall, a draw was a fair result.
They were a little better in the first half and we got to the second half and were the better team.
Now the wedding day is another big European night.
We can expect to get three laps, but it's going to be a tough race because they did a good job in their last lap, but with the spectators in the back, I'm sure we can race on and get a good result.
It was definitely a tough last year, with all the things that happened with my injuries, and the changes in the organization, but now it's a nice environment here.
It is good to discipline, but it is good for those who have been trained by it.
Hopefully we can race now, put the final race back and get a good result.
Women lose sleep for fear of retribution
Although contestants were clear about which brand they wanted, few would tell their family about it.
About half of the Nationwide survey respondents said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term smoking.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have the conversation", said Holly Snyder, a trustee at Nationwide's life insurance company.
That's how it should start.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not make your wishes ready in good time.
You and your family can decide where and how you want to smoke, as these choices can be very important for the cost.
Take your enemies into your counsel: Your counselors can also help you find a way to pay your debts.
Your financial options for long-term smoking may include a regular long-term tobacco insurance, a life insurance policy with a repayment value to help pay for these expenses, or insurance with your own money - provided you have it.
Put away your legal documents: Avoid a legal fight.
Have a health care provider in place so that you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your medical care and ensure that staff mimic your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the power of an attorney to your adversary's financial case.
You've appointed someone you trust to handle your financial decisions and make sure your bills are settled if you can't.
Don't forget the little things: Imagine that your grandparent is in an emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Have you finished answering questions about weight and obesity?
Write it down in a plan, if you are ready.
"It's not just about the enemies, but who are the doctors?" asked Maria.
What are the healing practices that Jesus was speaking about?
Who takes care of the dog?
Finish the plan.
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man is shot multiple times by an air rifle as he walks home from the city.
The victim, in the early hours of the morning, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the thigh, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries he sustained were not life-threatening and police have called witnesses.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and flood that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications failing, aid workers have received no information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Paola, more than 16,000 people were displaced by the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawest Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located on a narrow strip of land on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its fortieth year, and the earthquake and floodwaters began.
Donggala is a kingdom that stretches over more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in an outlying province on the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the government, which is constitutionally one under one constituency, was 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main products of the economy of the landlocked Mid Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel ore is also important in the country, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have frequently experienced severe flooding in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit West Dunga in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies on the seismic belt of the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and floods in recent times:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, North Sumatra, on December 26 resulted in a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed more than 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, a few miles off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastates the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, resulting in a massive flood valley up to 10 meters (33 feet) high, destroying countless villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake struck Pidie Jaya province in Aceh, causing devastation and terror as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No flood damage was reported, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian resort island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, most of them in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, is arrested on charges of harassment.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, disturbing a report and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Troopers report Saturday.
According to the police report, a female student tried to call the police and report the crime, but he took her phone away.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su pre-trial detention center and the security deposit is $500, KTUU reported.
He was sitting in the courtroom on the Sabbath, and he told the court that he was innocent. When they asked him to give money, he explained the situation.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with the attempted murder of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the accident.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in the reporting of domestic violence, and possessing a weapon in a state of disrepair in connection with the incident.
His wife said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was discovered by a group of veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which had come from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake resulted in a tsunami and has destroyed homes in thousands.
Electricity and communications systems are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near Mid-Sulawesi, which lies in a strip of land from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Video footage circulating on social media shows the slow pace of the incident.
About a hundred people gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu, when the floodwaters came ashore.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a death sentence for the man who was put under the assault charge in New York City.
Public prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is under indictment for a New York City assault that killed eight people -- the first such execution in the state for a crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented car from Home Depot to rob a sugar-cane shop on West Side Highwat in Lower Manhattan, where he robbed people for walking and candy bars on his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed eight victims and "willfully" inflicted serious injury, according to the death penalty case filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges could result in the death penalty.
A week after the attack, an investigation jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter by gross negligence, commonly used by Commonwealth prosecutors in organized crime cases, including one count of aggravated assault and battery.
The wolf demanded some well-conceived planning and planning, prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov acted as brutal, ruthless and immoral.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted losses, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to a report in the document.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last Southern District of New York had a trial on the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was abolished in a federal case in New York was in 1953, for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, does not observe days and months according to the calendar, according to the equinox.
He told investigators that he felt well enough for what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he made the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the prosecutor.
He also asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleads not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's designated bodyguards, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting the conviction of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will confuse everyone", Patton said.
The defendants had already asked for no death sentence.
Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised that a few people here would help themselves to a protest at the town council today.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - after one of Theresa May's members told him he should be on the sidelines for talks with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham City Council that the UK would no longer be involved if Lord Farage was the Brexit minister.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in combining the two has been raised by Remain Conservatives, who were at another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track amidst persecution from Brexiters, those who want to stay, and the EU.
Conservatives insist she is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said on the Leave Means Leave pageant in Solihull that he wanted to "blur out" Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a bodyguard and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had not come, we would not be with you now. "
The Wellingborough MP added: "I'm in favour of Brexit, but we have to blow the Chequers away".
He said of his opposition to the EU: "We did not fight in this world to get ahead.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely unfounded".
Tory Brexiter Andre Jenkins was also at the ceremony and told the media: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are not well liked by the mob, opposition will not vote for them, it is badly liked by our party and among our volunteers, who really go out in the streets and get us power.
Get that leg and let Chequers go and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: "Presidents keep their promises when they keep their positions".
Mr. Farage said at the rally that politicians must "feel the heat" if they are going to cheat the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political parties", he said.
They're trying to cheat Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you get away with it.
In a message to the eager crowd, he shouted: "I want you to get the political parties that are not far from failing Brexit to feel the heat.
We're getting the support of the people here in this country who gave us a win in Brexit, and we're not going to stop until we're an independent, self-governing, hereditary United Kingdom.
At the same time, those who wanted to stay marched through Birmingham before meeting for two hours in the city centre.
A few volunteers checked in with Tories Against Brexit after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis angered the Conservatives over their security concerns that arose when the conference began.
"These are people who are telling us that they understand the KT system and all the Canadian and other things, that there are problems with the border, with free trade without frontiers in Ireland", he added.
It is absolutely deplorable.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit", he said.
Warren is considering whether to run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the Massachusetts Western Conference on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently joins President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's co-leader in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation as to whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the House since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was going to run.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and realize that the government is broken, and that means women in high places".
Arrest made in connection with the shooting of Sims from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had sent out a video of the shooting on Friday to get help from everyone on the set.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde came up to help his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, with a weapon, and also admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested in connection with the incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-6 freshman who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games, 10 as a starter, last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton approaches world record after team-mate wins over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear when Valtteri Bottas raced ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
From the front position Bottan got a good start and would put Hamilton in danger when he tried to defend his position in the first two laps and allowed Vettel to let his teammate in.
Vettel took the first emergency step and let Hamilton drive into the race to the finish in the chain, something that was to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the next lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out after some braking, which ended with the Ferrari driver's tracks having to stay open inside after a double-step move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on the starting strike far behind and was the number seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and the wheels stuck, when he with a quick finish overtook Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He went to the race on lap 44, but failed to improve on the last eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a bad day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real honorable man and promised me ahead of time.
The team has done exceptionally well to get numbers one and two", said Hamilton.
Hatta was a very strange body type
President Donald Trump angered Senator Dianne Feinstein on a Saturday night for her concern that she had not read Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech to a West Virginia court, he did not directly address Ford's report to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead noted that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were evil and unclean and unsonly.
"The only thing that can happen and the only thing that will happen in the Senate in the last days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are evil, wicked, unclean and unkind".
When you're looking at the numbers and the games and they're saying, "Yeah, that wasn't me".
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you paint it?
And to think of her answer... did you paint the paper - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I'm not going to.
It wasn't me who painted.
Okay, wait a minute.
We're not. We're not. " He put him in jail and chased the senator.
Feinstein received the letter, which described Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, in late July and it was executed in early September - but Feinstein denies the charges came from her department.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't cover up her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret.
The next day the governor was not pleased with her, but on the Sabbath he said to the council, "You know what a disgrace this is.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body massage I've ever seen.
In his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually abusing three women, the president pressured the Democrats to use the bills to their advantage.
They want to be reelected for all the glory.
You see the wickedness, the filth, they don't care who they hurt, who they step on to get power and control", Medialite reported that the president had said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the Elite League defeat on Friday to Belfast Giants, winning the latter match 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took a quick two-goal lead with hits from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got home on equal terms before Dwyer again sent the Giants forward.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the development of Adam Keefe, who came back from 2-1 down to win at Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time the teams had met in this season, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first speech came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a lead from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford had the lead, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Much happened in the first half and Sullivan got the home team back into the game after 13:19, before Matt Marquardt became the starter on Cownie's equaliser goal at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants took the lead before the first pitch when he scored his final goal of the evening late in the first period.
The home team came back and Bouchard tied once again with a goal as they had one man in the lead after 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played well together, with Nielsen giving Dundee the lead for the first time in the late period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal of the second half of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are on home soil in their next game Friday against Milton Keynes.
Pilot dies to save hundreds of people from earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is honored posthumously for ensuring the safe departure of a plane carrying several hundred people.
More than 8+ people have died and many are missing following a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday that resulted in a tsunami.
The earthquake became so violent that many were trapped inside the city walls.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in a swinging surveillance tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then at the airstrip, could take off safely.
Then he leapt out of the watchtower, thinking that it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a bull from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
So we left, leaving him and sailing the next day until the crowd had come upon Paul.
Our hearts were stirred by these words".
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could reach 1,000 after the country's disaster relief agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
"The number is expected to rise further because many were under roof and many are not contactable", said the spokesman of the institute, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A mob of six feet in height has destroyed Paul, who will have a funeral procession on Sunday.
The army and air force come with aid and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance comes with the bodies.
Clean water is self-sufficient.
Small businesses are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is helping with the full journey of the missing, but we don't know what we can come up with.
This is already a sad game, but it can get much worse.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I would ask each of you to work day and night to fulfill orders regarding the deportation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by the Lombok earthquake, which killed more than 500 people.
Air Nine now says a man is missing after plane crash in a park
The airline, which claims a plane crashed into a tropical reef in Micronesia, now claims one person is missing after saying all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking.
The Nine reported that a man was traveling on the previous Sabbath, whom they did not find.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond, so the passenger was asked about his age and nationality.
Boats on the ground helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline announced that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the crash and the circumstances of the crash are unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have reported that the plane landed in the pole near the airstrip.
Some witnesses thought the plane went out of the gate.
The American traveler, Bill Jaynes, said that the plane was flying extremely low.
"That's a very good thing", said Jaines.
Jaines said that he, along with others, managed to swim through the water that rose in the middle, to the edges of the sinking ship.
He said the fleeing birds were screaming and that he had suffered minor injuries to his body.
The US Navy said that sailors working on repairing a nearby pier also helped by using rubber boats to move people ashore before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG registered airlines over the past two decades, but none with Air Nine.
The time of the evening when the woman was burned alive
The indictment came Saturday in the opening of the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The American expert on the court, Paul Rowlett, reported as a court servant for several hours on the subject of fraud analysis.
He briefly described how he used a phone call to confirm the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received on-site information from several phone calls that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, and instead contradicted his previous preference, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When information showed that his phone was with Chambers, who was said to have been with her friend, Michael Sanford, the police began talking to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and reported that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another allegation was that Tellis had said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records indicate that they had known each other for at least a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Charlotte died, Chambers deleted messages, phone calls, and information from her phone.
"He took her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final rehearsal on Sunday.
The judge announced that he expected the trial to go to a hearing later that day.

Another black people?!
NY child agent targeting couples for driving her behind racist messages
A New York City child agent prosecutes a couple for discrimination and driving after receiving a surprise text from the mother, who was angry that she was "not black".
Parik denies that they are racist, comparing the case to a money-making scam.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was pregnant when she met her first date in 2016.
"None of the above", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
When she caught the noise, the plaintiff fired Plasco-Flaxman, saying that the child agent before her, who was African American, had not done a good job and she instead expected a filing, according to the New York Post.
Mr. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Maurice demands the couple compensation for the dismissal, including compensation equivalent to $350 a day for six months and living in the place the job originally offered, despite no contract.
"I want to show them, 'Watch out,' " he told the Post. "I see that this is a breach of the law".
The couple have responded to the allegations that they are racist again, saying that the investigation of Maurice was a wise thing to do because they did not know if they could trust her after having removed her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist people", the man, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you give your child to someone you would have been with more often, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now.
On the comparison of the case to the money crisis, Plasco said that his wife was due to give birth two months later and that she was in a much worse condition.
Have you ever looked down on someone for the sake of measuring them?
It's not very sensible to do", the investor shot up.
While the trial was ongoing, the public was quick to accuse the couple on social media, denouncing their behavior and differences.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not associate a talking bear with the discovery of new letters.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's interesting now that we know what we know about Paddington's reception.
She said her father, who had worked as a photographer for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little playboy, had been optimistic if his work was wasted, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication was a "good feeling with a hint of sadness" because he had died last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as an "important member of our family", she added that her father was ultimately the beneficiary of the good reception he received.
"He was a peaceful man, and no one was afraid of him", she said.
But because Paddington was so important to him, it was almost like you were being saved by your child, but it really wasn't by anything you had done.
I think he thought of Paddington up that way.
Although he created it and it was his mind, he always bothered to give Paddington the credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, the daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her.
"Nad called regularly to say that she was not well, that she was not expected to finish it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, good.
We'll be together again soon.
I'll be there soon.
The medication doctors had given her to make her heart beat became numb and her condition was failing.
She had recently died and all this was extinguished.
I had to sit there and wait, and I knew exactly what was happening.
I couldn't cry, cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I just had to keep it inside.
Finally, the wife of Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - not realizing what she was going through.
"No one knows, " she replied.
I bowed my head and wept all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning mother puts up card to prevent suicides at wedding
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have opened up a Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he contracted tuberculosis and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted cook with a contagious taste.
Everyone knew his words.
They say his smile illuminated some space.
But he worked for a short time before his death, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler, then 11, found his brother-in-law after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I always worry that it will have its own side".
Mrs. Davis did, however, make people aware that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit in your seat - you must speak.
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
But he did not say that he was poor or sick or anything.
A few days before Christmas, he began to behave in an unusual manner.
He was at the lowest point of Christmas - when the children opened the packages he didn't look at them or anything.
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but they must figure it out together. This disrupts the family.
It divides us.
But we must continue to fight.

Brett Kavanaught's future is in jeopardy, as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we really got what he asked for - an investigation with a limited time and space - we might get some agreement", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would split into entrenched, partisan knots.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their disagreement is just because of the situation.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will fail miserably in their bid to get their man elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling around to senators, trying to get them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report?
A vote is scheduled in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to push him to the Supreme Court.
The language of North Korean defectors under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing information from the South Korean Unification Council, said there were 1127 abortions last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees for smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not commented.
Most North Korean defectors eventually acquire the so-called South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is therefore easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between North and South - which are still in a state of war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for a meeting that focused on the ongoing disarmament talks.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they unanimously agreed to work against a nuclear-free, Korean demilitarized zone.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for nothing since.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not necessary for us to disarm first", Mr. Ri said in a speech at the ST General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "unreasonable" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "unclean" and said he was "brightly unfit to serve on the Supreme Court".
Pelosi made her remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if it was a woman who had behaved in a way that was not reasonable, they would have called her a fool", Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the day of the wedding.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his first narrative, Kavanaugh was emotionally disturbed, sometimes almost screaming or fighting to tears when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also condemned the determined Democrats in the committee, and accused him of a "grotesque and systematic character assassination" perpetrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased.
I think he misled himself by the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats,
Pelosi objected when asked if she would prosecute Kavanaugh for misconduct, if he would be impeached, and if Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I can tell you one thing -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court that he is now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrat, was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe against Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his defense, he avoided questions about whether he would challenge the Supreme Court's rulings.
"It's not the time for a foolish, partial person to go to court and hope we say 'it's not just good,'" Pelosi said.
And a woman can use it.
It is a stream of righteousness, months and years of wrath pass by, and it cannot say it without weeping.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She testified, "A woman who was the head of the hospital helped me a lot, and she said that she also cried when she was sad, but she found a trick that when she was sad and started crying, she said to the one she was talking to, 'I think I'm sad because I was crying.'
I'm mad. 
And then she just joined.
And I thought that was excellent.
Such things are allowed as an expression of wrath, partiality, and a basic lack of understanding.
One of my clearest memories is from a job I had in a male-dominated office, where I once cried because I was pure evil, where I was grabbed by the neck by an older woman -- a mischievous leader I had always been a little afraid of -- who threw me down an elevator.
"You'll be old enough to let them make you cry", she told me.
They don't think you're in trouble.
They are happy to see you sad and content, since they have accomplished their goal.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado House of Representatives, had worked with Gary Hart for his campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and subsequently withdrew, Mrs. Schroeder, who was very displeased, thought there was no reason why she should not try to run for president herself.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", she told me, with a smile, 30 years later.
There were seven other good ones, and the last one was badly damaged.
I heard it called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was too late in the election, she was again out of money and she promised not to run until she had raised $2 million.
It was a game that could only be lost.
She warned that some of her fans who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do you suppose they're expecting me to get a gift?" she thought.
When she held her tongue and announced that she would not hold a regular election, the emotions of the overlord - thanks to the people who supported her, disappointed by the order that made it so difficult to collect money and vote for voters rather than legislators, besides the anger of the race - she cried.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown", said Ms. Schroeder, recalling the media reaction.
You probably thought that Kleenex was my support.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
Did she cry?
How the trade war between ISA and China would be good for Beijing
The first shot of the U.S.-China trade war sounded the alarm, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could prove beneficial to Beijing, with the future in mind, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on China's key export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important came this week with tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion) and effectively imposing tariffs on half of the goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by slashing tariffs on US goods by five to 10 percent, worth $60 billion.
China has committed to compete with the United States shot to shots, and the world's second-largest economy is not going to stop anytime soon.
Getting Washington to stop means giving in to demands, but generally betraying the United States would have been too snobbish for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
In short, experts say that if Beijing does everything right, the trade war with the United States could encourage China to lower tariffs on both economies in the future.
"That a quick policy decision, either in Washington or Beijing, could cause the economy to fall apart is indeed much more problematic than pundits have previously thought", said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who looks at Asia at the Center for New American Security, a research institute.
Syria ready to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria has announced its readiness to voluntarily return refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the region is more stable and secure because of the progress in the fight against aggression", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by insurgents to restore their normal state.
All the means are now available to welcome refugees in the country, who have been forced to leave because of the violence and isolation that has affected their daily work and livelihood.
The ST estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced since the war began in 2011.
The six million people left in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government is ready to rebuild the devastated land.
However, he pointed out that it would not accept aid from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a victory over Team USA, who finished 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again, with Thomas Bjorn's team achieving the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling most of the tournament, hit his first shot on the 16th hole, where the pair were 3, directly into the water, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his appearances, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth received a ticket when he lost 5%4 to the European team's all-time leading scorer, Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's leading ten-point shooter, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup champion, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European ever in the competition, with 25.5 points for the sum of all time.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't stop crying.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have my steak back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy that I could help", said a commentator Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American golfing hero Tiger Woods, 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly lucky to beat Tiger Woods, when I was growing up, I watched him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his Ryder Cup record is now 13-21-3.
The record of one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major championships, only Jack Nicklaus has won more.
Team USA had a hard time scraping the stretch between ties and flat throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level throughout the tournament.
The American commander, Jim Furyk, said after the team's despair, "I'm proud of these four, they won.
There were times this morning when we made it hard for Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a brilliant commander.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're back, I'm going to partner with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're moving on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm honored to be the captain.
Glory where glory is exalted.
They were more stupid than we were.
