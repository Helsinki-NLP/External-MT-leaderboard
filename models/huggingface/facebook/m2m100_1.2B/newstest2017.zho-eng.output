28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who had just moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim’s brother said he couldn’t imagine who would want to hurt him and said “everything is finally fine.”
The San Francisco Bureau of Coronation Officers said the body found in the West田 shopping center on Wednesday morning confirmed that it was Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death case was ruled to be his murder and an investigation is underway.
Louis Galicia, the victim’s brother, told radio station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a plumbing chef in Boston, had found an ideal job as a plumbing chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were “very shocked” by Frank’s death.
The spokesman said: “We’re a small team of people who live together like an intimate family and we’ll miss him deeply.”
In this sad moment, we express our deepest sympathy and condolences to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank originally lived in the hostel, but recently “everything finally went well.”
Louis Galicia told KGO: “Frank found an apartment while dating a girl.”
Louis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine who would want to harass his brother.
Frank had a kind heart and a wide heart.
Louis Galicia said: “Frank often cooked dinner for his family.”
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He is a man who follows everyone’s opinion.
Louis Galicia said, “Everything in the world can go wrong, but Frank can be called an outsider who shines every day.”

Primary physicians strike: call for new labor action
The primary physician representative called on the coalition to approve its new labour action against new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association’s primary doctor’s committee will ask all its members to start supporting more labor campaigns from early September.
The primary medical committee said the ministers did not address concerns over the contract.
Primary physicians and medical students voted against the deal with the British Medical Association in July.
Out of the voting members, 58 percent opposed the deal.
Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the primary doctor’s committee, said in a letter to members on Twitter on Thursday night that the government had “consistently remained silent” about issues that led to contractual resistance.
She said: “In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Primary Physicians Committee has voted in full to reject the proposed new contract and called for a resumption of formal consultations on all concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the Executive Committee of the Primary Physicians Committee has today formally asked the British Medical Association Council to convene a special meeting to approve a long-term plan aimed at upgrading labor operations from early September.
The dispute has led primary doctors to participate in a total of six strikes this year, including the first overall strike in the history of the UK’s national healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, primary physician leader of the British Medical Association, resigned after a vote against a contract agreement recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before the 54,000 primary physicians and medical students voted, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be compulsory for healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: “Greece is not in the alliance”?
A gesture ends a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday, shaking hands and officially announcing an end to eight-month war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish president in a magnificent hall in the St. Petersburg Palace, I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was what Ankara most wanted to see.
Both sides shaken hands.
However, even according to Mr. Putin’s ever-converting criteria, Putin is only a shallow smile, with little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan hasly mentioned Putin as a “good friend” five times.
I do not remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia will return to the level before the crisis, and even to a higher level.
The next day, one of the newspapers wrote that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something contrary.
However, Mr. Putin’s continued cool attitude indicates that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian aircraft at the Syrian border.
The reaction from Moscow was fierce.
Mr. Putin strongly criticized the incident, accusing Ankara of hiding behind Moscow.
Attacks from so-called friends are more unacceptable.
It is difficult, or even impossible, for both sides to re-establish genuine trust.
Since November, the Russian public opinion has also been reversed.
For months, the government-controlled media has carried out a shocking full-fledged assault on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
The worst of them came from accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s family profited from illegal oil trading in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has vehemently denied this claim.
However, St. Petersburg’s news shows that it’s time to look forward.
After all, the premise for the meeting was that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the ceasefire are obvious.
First, Erdogan was more likely to be ousted after the failed coup last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The ongoing terrorist attacks have apparently hit him heavily.
There are also economic motives.
Russia’s sanctions hit Turkey heavily, in particular by banning charter flights that could carry millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
This number has dropped significantly by almost 90%.
With the resumption of flights, the Russian travel agencies and charter airlines will surely relax.
They will meet the Mediterranean tourism tide at the end of the season.
The state television even predicted this week that the price of fruit and vegetables would fall once Turkish agricultural imports resumed.
A report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: “Tourists are gone, tomatoes are back.”
For Moscow, this visit also has additional political value.
Ankara is angry at the weak reaction of the Western world to the intention to take over.
In addition, Ankara has long disappointed with the slow progress in EU accession negotiations and Putin’s interference, and Putin is keen to exploit political colds and weaken Turkey’s relations with the Western world.
By supporting the elected authorities after the failed coup, Russian leaders will surely get Ankara’s points.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always embraced a deeply rooted fear of regime change.
Thus, the encounter at this glorious palace on the shore made Russia and Turkey allies to two nations rejected and abused by the Western world, which one analyst described as “no alliance”.
However, despite the public reconciliation, there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors.Moscow has played a role in Syria recently, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite factions.
It is foreseeable that after three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at the conference that they had not yet talked about the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, which Putin stressed.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to seek a survival in the Syrian issue.
With months of open hostility and the possibility of major disasters caused by Turkey’s shooting down of Russian fighter jets, it is a good thing for the two leaders to resume the dialogue.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland
According to the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified into a logistics department.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC’s Scottish branch that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand has been committed to its global ambition.
But eight years ago, he was in danger of collapse, and had to accept rescue from then on and gave up his pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sports events such as the Six Nations Soccer and Wimbledon Tennis Championship champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right approach is to make more national brands emerge.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not respond.
In England and Wales, all references outside of headquarters and securities transactions will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous Region of Northern Ireland.
There are other more prominent smaller private banking brands, such as Advisory Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McCain was interviewed during a visit to Inverness with clients and staff.
He told the British Broadcasting Company’s Scottish branch, “The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employees’ employed brands, because in the larger sense we are now a bank with many brands.”
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
At the moment, what I want to say is that we are no longer focused on the global, we have turned our eyes to the local.
Each brand represents a difference in their respective industries, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship; at the same time, it has worked to boost the image of different brands sponsoring sports events.
The CEO said: “Now is the time to become a multi-brand bank, because privately we’ve been exploring how to become a bank that better serves our customers.”
If three years ago we wanted to become a big bank with many brands, it would be ridiculous.
We are currently focusing on customer needs and I’m sure you’ve noticed these changes.
I think we can reboot these brands, and now is the right time.
De Gea wins 3,000 career wins with Predilection in Newcastle
Newcastle's two victories helped De Gea win 3,000 professional wins, after which he sprinkled champagne to celebrate.
On Friday, professional horse racer Frankie Dettori achieved his 3,000th victory at Newmarket.
He managed the Predilection from the hands of the coach John Gosden on the horse track, winning two victories that night, and thus achieving 3,000 professional victories.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse racer to this milestone in the field of ground racing.
The top five were Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion at Ghayyar earlier said: “It’s special.”
I was excited because my family was there too.
I am pleased with my achievements at Newcastle because I started here 30 years ago.
It’s not a massive horse racing, nor is it the Royal Ascot, it’s just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am pleased and humble.
De Toulouse brought Predilection after the victory, which caused the whole game to cheer.
In the field of obstacle racing, two riders have achieved this achievement, champion riders Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with Sir McCoy having won more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berg is a German champion for nine times, with 4,493 victories in his career.
De Gea was one of the greatest knights of his time, so it is no surprise that he achieved this landmark achievement, with few people before him.
He was fashionable and sophisticated, but what really made him stand out in the weight room was his tactical reason.
He was a great horse ambassador and over the years, his enthusiasm and charm have attracted a large number of fans for the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsom that if he wasn’t just a weekend with a rider, he should have won 6,000!
Seriously, it’s too important that Deutery can be called the best horse winner in England in thirty years.
His character is lively, which is good for English horses, but besides that, he is an incredible rider.
De Toulouse celebrates this milestone with its iconic jump-down move
From jumping to jumping, De Gea has been a typical representative of the British field for twenty years.
His career was like a mountain car.
He has won several competitions, including the famous "seven wins in a row" at the Royal Scotia Horse Championship in 1996, but he also suffered an airplane crash and was banned from the competition due to drug use.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after the end of the six-month suspension, he had a hard time.H, he showed an astonishing personality advantage and finally returned to the top, giving the skeptics the first shot.
He may not be able to do it for a long time — De Gea had said earlier that he hoped to play at least until he was 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin removes Sergei Ivanov from office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed the post of head of the office of the President Sergei Ivanov.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of the core group that Mr. Putin has profoundly trusted.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr. Putin had “declared the removal of Ivanov’s position as head of the office of the Russian president,” but did not give any reason.
Anton Vaino, who began as Mr. Ivanov’s deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino is 44 years old and a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow National Academy of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government staff, the Kremlin website (in Russian) as it is said.
After being appointed, he said to Mr. Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of this government is to support the heads of state in drafting laws and controlling the implementation of directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself requested his resignation and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over.
Is that smile convincing?
Moscow is confused about this.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov has been one of Putin’s closest assistants and, like Putin, has worked for the KGB.
As head of office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
In a national television broadcast meeting with President Putin, the two said the head of the office had requested his resignation.
Despite smiling faces in front of the camera, hardly anyone convinces — especially in this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this caused by a defeat in a power struggle?
Not yet known.
But the official statement—a candidate who was once seen as a presidential candidate suddenly chooses to take over Russia’s environmental policy—raises many doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov’s conversation with Mr. Putin as saying, “Yes, in early 2012, in a conversation, I asked you to give me this hard-to-do position, and maybe even a troublesome position, for a four-year term.”
“As a result, I’ve been the chairman of the President’s Office for four to eight months.”
Mr. Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Agency.
At the end of the 1990s, when Mr. Putin was chief of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Service), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
After Mr. Putin took office, he named Mr. Ivanov one of his five most trusted people.
The outside world once thought that Mr. Ivanov could become President of Russia after Mr. Putin’s second term, because the three-term term was unconstitutional.
But the position eventually came to Putin’s other close assistant, Dmitry Medvedev.
Prior to being re-elected president three and a half years later, Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious Fish Surprises Banff in a Garden
A resident of Banff found a fish in his garden and then asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish may have been sanded by a marine tornado.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the ocean, posted a video of this strange scene on Periscope, hoping someone could explain why the two-inch fish appeared.
The Queensbury Bridge now leads to Faff.
The £13.5 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have linked the northern side of the Queensferry Crossing and the high-rise bridge together, meaning that the bridge now leads to Fauff.
The three-headed bridge near each bridge is now close to completion, and the project is the first bridge.
The bridge starts at Fauff, 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 meters.
It used 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slopes.
The £13.5 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and became one of the first people to climb the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queensbury Bridge.”
We’ve all witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project that more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel were used to build the bridge alone.
Although the size and weight of the bridge is huge, the completion of the joint between the high-rise bridge and the bridge surface requires fine work and very precise assembly.
Overall, 79 percent of the bridge surface is now installed, and the last part of the concrete bridge surface is now in Rosyth, meaning all bridge surfaces are ready.
Michael Martin, project director of the Queensbury Bridge Building Company, said: “No matter which bridge project, the first junction is a major milestone.”
In terms of the remarkable projects, this time the company demonstrates cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After the last section of the road panel is installed and connected to the expanded North Bridge Bridge road panel, the remaining gap cluster on the north side or close to the land side will be completed.
To complete the operation, the northern high-rise bridge should be moved 700 mm south.
It is a huge scale task, but also a very precise task.
It is said to be huge because the bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 meters, requiring a slope of about 3 percent.
To say it’s precision is because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, with only a few millimeters on each side.
It is pleasant that everything goes well.
Simon Bayers wins female gymnastics championship.
Forget about pressure.
Forget about hype.
Simone Biles was not affected by all of this.
Full of energy when jumping horses.
The balance of wood is sufficient.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
The overall performance is excellent.
He finally became an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast picked up the All-Power Championship on Thursday, fully demonstrating her world-leading talent in gymnastics on the Olympic field.
She outperformed the silver medal winner with a total of 62,198 points, “Final Five” team member Aly Raisman and bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
Simon-Bayers from the United States performed a balanced wood performance on Thursday at the women’s individual gymnastics final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bayers helped the United States team in the Olympic women's gymnastics individual to four consecutive wins, she personally won a total of five medals at this Olympic Games, further confirming that she is the generation and possibly the best gymnast ever.
At the moment she saw her score, Bayles couldn’t stop shedding tears and finally ended her long journey.
Bayers thus ranks up in the ranks of "decade-on-year athletes" like Michael Phelps, who have taken their respective field sports projects to new heights:
Bayers has dominated the field for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including ten gold medals. Her ambition is to train every day to higher accuracy. 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said: “Bayers is the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
There’s a final tournament in Brazil, but it’s more of a competition between Bayers and other gymnastics than between herself and the pressure of a huge expectation.
If Bayes did not return home full of gold medals at her home in Spring, Texas, everyone would be very disappointed.
Simon Bayers (left) from the United States hugged each other with Lesmann, who won gold and silver medals in the individual gymnastics final of the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayers, who won their first gold medal on Tuesday, will be a surprise gift to the coming retired national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Bayers insisted that he had no plans for the future in the course of his year-on-year championship, the fact is not entirely that.
Part of Bayers’s free gymnastics — including her iconic twisting string — was accompanied by Latin music, which she often listened to in just one street apart from the Olympic venue in Rio.
This is not coincidence.
Adopted by grandparents as a baby and discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman during a field trip to the gym, this girl has grown into a strong force.
"Since the summer of 2013, Bayes hasn't lost in the All-Power Race, and if she wants to win, she'll win.
Mustafa's slightly ahead after two spins was just an illusion.
Balansing the two projects of wood and free gymnastics, the crown world champion Bayers is waiting.
Her balance tree score is 15,433, and her free gym score is 15,933.
Waiting for the final score, Lesmann gently hugged Bayles, leaving tears when Bayles learned that he had achieved his dreams.
Lesman’s performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she ranks third but loses to Mustafa in the final.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, called by the Americans the “grandmother,” is far ahead.
She kissed the crowd after the free gym and announced her return, but such a return sometimes seemed questionable before.
Byers is only 19 years old.Since the beginning of this week, his news has spread like a virus on Twitter.For Byers, his life has been given a new meaning.
Six-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old in the city to be shot this week.
The grandparents of the child confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown had several gunshot injuries in the abdomen, legs, arms, and abdomen, but the child was awake on the way.
“He suffered a lot of crimes and his little body was struck by bullets,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television.
I do not dare to believe.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
His family told television that the child hoped to recover.
He was about to start studying in a local elementary school in the first grade.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Among the other three people who were shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in critical condition and two others are in stable condition.
The television said the child and the 29-year-old victim in critical circumstances were found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether there was a gunman among the wounded.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like several gunmen were shooting.
A number of shells of offensive weapons were found on the scene, which suggests that they used different offensive weapons.
From this judgment, it is undoubtedly a continuing war.
There are bullets on both sides of the street.
“That’s how many armed men were at the scene at the time,” Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told television.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
No arrest has yet been carried out, and police arely reviewing surveillance videos.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old child (a girl) was shot in the arm while playing at the door of her home in the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering and police are still pursuing the suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabriel and Laurie?
That’s how I rated this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gym team has three outstanding gymnasts—Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren Laurie Hernandez—who have always inspired a number of colored girls.
Everyone is very proud of this team, including the Jewish Ali Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
This team finally looks like an American team.
It also consolidated the top position of black and Latin women in this movement.
For the past four years, the leading female gymnast has been African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel split first and second.
This is too great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabriel Douglas became an “surprisingly” Olympic champion, which has cheered the United States.
Today, the world can witness the outstanding performance of three-time world champions Simon Bayers, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have demonstrated their conventional gymnastics skills.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team four consecutive wins on the women’s individual all-power project.
Her teammate Ali Lesman won the silver medal.
We have reached the peak of the sport, but this is not the case in all-American gymnastics classes.
Simon, Gabriel and Laurie entered the Olympic team like Ali and Madison.
They are the “Final Five” because the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of four gymnasts, which is Marta Karolyi’s last year of training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, with gymnasts mainly trained in private gym clubs, their parents paying for training, facilities, trips, clothing, competitions and hotel fees (including coach and gymnast and family costs), and the list of fees is growing.
Most gym clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the industry.
All the training of gymnastics athletes is done in these clubs, which is a long-term costly expense for the gymnastics family.
Bayers coach Aimee Boorman and Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have been training them since the two gymnasts began to practice gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable, more accessible gymnastics training to the countless young girls who are deeply influenced by Simon, Gabriel, and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, inexpensive gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths (mostly blacks and Hispanics) in black residential areas and educate national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to the end of Tripoli (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to develop physical strength, flexibility and coordination, and helps to develop hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person’s health, academic and work success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their magnificent performance in winning the Olympic Group Gold Medals, and thanks to them for inspiring so many young girls from different backgrounds to embark on a path to being healthy, strong and successful.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, primary doctors plan to launch further strikes
The ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract by the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 primary physicians who voted opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunter revealed plans to enforce contracts, saying the UK’s National Health Services System (NHS) is currently in a “vacuum zone” and a slight delay would damage the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentions changing the practices of primary doctors working overnight and on weekends to improve care for irregular working hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Primary Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “Primary Physicians remain seriously concerned about the proposed contract, especially that it will exacerbate the current labor crisis and fails to treat all doctors fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left for the first doctors to sign new contracts, and we need to make progress, not much time.
BMA strives to resolve disputes through negotiations, but people are reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds with silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we got the promise from Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
“Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to abolish enforcement and address primary doctors’ concerns.
If he didn’t, the primary doctors made it clear that they were ready to take further labor action.
The last strike occurred in late April, resulting in 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 delayed appointments as nurses and consultants cover up doctors on the line.
The ministers initially hoped to end this change-induced dispute by accepting the revised BMA contract.
BMA hopes to fight for better weekend salaries for the 54,000 primary doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, urged primary doctors not to go on strike any more.
Mr. Mortimer said: “Labor campaigns have little effect, but instead put pressure on teams and services that have already been fully devoted, causing concerns, concerns and chaos for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have continuously negotiated with the Primary Physicians Committee and worked with the Ministry of Health and other departments to actively respond to their concerns about the role of caregivers and the disclosures.
Employers hope to continue to actively explore other important topics such as deployment, training flexibility, additional training for those who resume their careers, training costs, a common understanding of curriculum proposals, entry leave and gender pay differences in the healthcare sector, which illustrate the emphasis of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health on the agreement reached with BMA in November, February and May.
£2 daily medication reduces risk of heart attack
Relevant officials suggested that a £2 daily drug should be spread to more patients and extended time to take the pill, after which thousands of heart disease patients would benefit from the drug.
Anticoagulants (ticagrelor) can reduce the risk of recurrence of heart disease in patients with heart disease.
The drug continues to be taken for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a heart attack again.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), a sub-regulator of the National Health Service System (NHS), recommends that patients continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS regulator NICE recommends that patients continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, approximately 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, with a quarter of them continuing to experience recurrences or strokes.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the deposition of fatty substances in the wall of the arteries to form plaques.
If the plaque is broken, it will cause a blood clot, thus blocking the flow of blood into the heart, leading to heart attack.
If a blood clot moves, it enters the bloodstream, preventing blood flow into the brain, leading to a stroke.
Patients who have already experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of having a heart attack again.
Made by the British company AstraZeneca, Brilique is sold under the trade name Brilique, which can reduce the risk of disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
Today’s draft of NICE guidelines recommend that patients take 90 mg of TECGRA for 12 months, 60 mg of TECGRA daily for three years and two aspirin doses.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite effective secondary preventive treatments, up to one in four patients with a history of heart attack will recur or have a stroke, often with serious consequences.”
Fear of recurrence can have a great negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking Teagree with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrence of heart disease and stroke in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
We are delighted that the Temporary Recommendation of Teigree will provide thousands of more treatment options for those who benefit.
Due to limited information on the effectiveness and safety of the drug after three years, and in particular the risk of bleeding, the draft guidelines do not recommend continued treatment after this period.
Computer culture makes “election fraud” prevalent in Muslim regions
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year due to corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
A culture of “political correctness” has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a devastating government report reveals today.
Former Cabinet Secretary Sir Eric Pickles has accused police, election regulators and the municipality of ignoring evidence of abuse of elections for being “too sensitive to racial division and religious issues.”
The former minister of community affairs and current anti-corruption activist said that the practice of intimidating voters with religious positions is bad, and that police should be allowed to set up a warning line outside the polling stations to protect voters who are frightened.
He suggested that voters carry identity documents when voting to confirm their identity.
Voters only have to state their name and address.
The report even suggested that the voters put indelible ink on their fingers to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said efforts should be made to strengthen the protection of whistleblowers.
He called for more media access to conference documents and informal decisions made by committees or working groups.
“This is not just to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local governments from the poison of a widespread culture of corruption and financial fraud that is closely linked to it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that there was a series of corruption and illegal acts during Mayor Rahman’s tenure.
The court found that Rahman “very ridiculously abused” the religious emotions of the Muslim community and remained silent about the sword’s allegations of racial discrimination and Islamic phobia.
It is said that Rahman was “a religious obligation for loyal Muslims to declare voting for him in the campaign.”
Up to 300 ballots are suspected, and it is likely that voters fake others to vote.
Sir Eric said there is evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He especially warned of mail election fraud, allegedly by senior members of the Muslim community putting pressure on voters to force them to vote for the candidates they designated.
Sir Eric (pictured) has given a number of suggestions on clearing the voting mechanism, including bringing identity documents to confirm his identity.
“The evidence suggests that senior members, especially senior members in Pakistan and Bangladesh background communities, are putting pressure on some vulnerable groups in ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, to get them to vote as they want.”
“Because of their excessive sensitivity to racial segregation and religious ‘political correctness’, they fear that state institutions will ignore such behavior.”
Sir Eric has put forward 50 suggestions for clearing election mechanisms, including a strict ban on political activists handling mail voting documents to prevent “voting harvests.”
The report also calls for a rigorous check of registration information to prevent voter lists from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
These recommendations include requiring voters to present identity documents before voting.
After voting, the voter's fingers are dotted with indelible ink to prevent someone from voting again.
Systematic verification of the nationality of voters to ensure eligibility.
The validity period for automatic mail voting requests is limited to three years.
Political activists and militants are prohibited from processing completed mail votes and mail voting envelopes.
Authorized police to set up a warning line around the polling stations.
Amendments to the provisions of the law make it easier to accuse persons concerned of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photographing at the polling stations is illegal.
It is only available in English at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthening training to ensure that staff strictly comply with the provisions of "voters go to the polling stations separately".
Sir Eric criticized the Metropolitan Police, saying they did not raise any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident, saying it was “surprising.”
“Rahman and his election officers have been exposed to a number of corruption and illegal acts and have therefore been disqualified by the electoral court,” he said.
According to criminal proof standards, he is undoubtedly guilty in many respects.
He also criticized the municipal election registration department's fake "selection box inspection".
Sir Eric said: “Last year the court sounded the alarm clock on the Tower Hamlets verdict.”
Our country has a glorious tradition of being the “mother of parliament,” but some institutions secretly covered up with electoral fraud and subsequent resistance are worrying and threaten this good reputation.
At the Rio Olympics, cyclists who looked like Princess Kate’s bikers and faced other celebrities were sought after
This week, at the 2016 Rio Olympics, French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looks like Princess Kate, was highly sought by the audience.
But the 24-year-old is not the only celebrity gold medalist at the Summer Olympics, at least the social media doesn’t think so.
So, to commemorate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrity faces that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympic players who hit Hollywood stars.
The Hunter and the Wolf: American male shooter Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to hitting Kate’s face on the bike track, many netizens soon discovered that a shooter was simply Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin brother.
Since his picture of the Wolf of Wall Street protagonist appeared on Twitter, American male shooter Bradley Ellison has caused huge riots on social media.
In fact, the shooter was aware of the social media hype and admitted that when a little bit is played, someone says he looks like a little bitch.
“I don’t think I look very similar, except for my cheeks,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a handsome flower man, so I think it’s a praise to me.”
One of the most popular contrasts at the 2012 Olympics in London will undoubtedly be found with more similarities this year: British jumpper Greg Rutherford looks like the very famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, who has a pair of big eyes that can talk, is shown to look like Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the swimming field, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
The user thinks Nathan Adrian is the "sports version" of the actor in "Inception".
Another pair that has been compared is tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, whose eyebrows and lips look very similar.
The silver medal-winning Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalynne McCord have the same bronze skin and blonde, while the U.S. team’s Naomi is likened to “the sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.”
Women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter Actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was delighted to find that others also saw these similarities.
Communication Theory: According to this user, this pair looks like there may be a reason.
A Twitter user recently joyfully stated on the Internet that “other netizens also think that Hopper Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look the same.”
Indeed, the American football star and the star of The Bloody Doctor have very similar faces and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost the same as that of actress Laura Linney; and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and bright smile resembles that of Bring It On star star Gabriel Union.
CBC Olympic Spokesman Apologizes for Chinese Swimming Athlete's Comment "Slow Like a Pig"
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comment on 14-year-old General Aydin's winning fourth place in a women's 4x200m free swimming relay angered audiences watching Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) live broadcast of the Olympics.
A spokesperson for Canadian broadcaster CBC said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would “swim faster than the smell” during the race, but “was slow as a pig” after CBC was forced to apologize.
Commentator Byron McDonald made some of his opinions at the end of the women’s 4x200m free swimming draw final, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
The audience heard the CBC team commentator, Byron, who commented on “colored glasses” said: “The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.”
Because they were too excited, they started swimming faster than the smell, but later slow as a pig.
Really thanks to her.
The current 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Aydin is the second, with a time of 1 minute 57 seconds 79 – behind Canadian Taylor Ruck 1.61 seconds, then making the Canadian team narrowed the gap with China.
Audiences across Canada were stunned by the commentator’s voice and words, and they quickly reacted on the net.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC interpreter say the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was ‘slow like a pig’?”
The idiot did not realize it was on live broadcast.
Chinese junior general Aiheng, who participated in the women's 4x200m free swimming draw final, was described as: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Criticism of Byron McDonald on Twitter quickly spread over Twitter, with many asking him to withdraw from comment.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonald’s reacted slowly, they didn’t stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow #Byron McDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and your words make us all sound like a group of racists.
Shortly thereafter, CBC host Scott Russel apologized for Byron's remarks in a live broadcast, saying: "We apologize for the commentary on the live swimmers' performance."
“We are sorry for this inappropriate statement.”
CBC apologized 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the statement
Scott Russel apologizes on behalf of Byron
CBC subsequently paste copies of their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting on Byron's words.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are very sorry for saying this and broadcasting it live.
Last night, we acted swiftly to apologize to the audience who watched our live broadcasts and those who watched us on social media.
It should be noted that Byron’s explanation was aimed at the performance of the swimmer, but not at her person.
That is to say, the wording is indeed inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry for it.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald's apologized in a live broadcast, saying his words did not mean half a personal assault, and attempted to use it to get away with his words.
“I’d like to take some time to apologize for what I said after the end of the women’s qualifying last night,” he said on CBC Olympics broadcast.
“I’m just commenting on the performance of the swimmers, not their individual.”
“Of course I don’t mean disrespect, I’m sorry.”
Primark customers express anger at a shameless woman trying to wear underwear in the center of the store
A woman in the middle of a Primark store tried her underwear, and customers didn’t know where to look.
Worse, she also looked at what she looked like after wearing it, then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried four underwear in the boutique at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The woman tried her underwear in the Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone and then put it back on the shelves.
Jenny Davidson, who was also in the store at the time, said that after trying the underwear, the mysterious woman “wore her clothes again and went out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, “No one dares to believe what they see.”
She stood in the middle of the store, took a little underwear from the shelf, took off her underwear and underwear, and put it on.
“She didn’t try to go to hiding places to try through—she just stood there, it was shameful.”
“When she took off her underwear again, everyone was shocked and stunned. apparently she was still dissatisfied because she put her underwear back on the shelf.”
Afterwards, she tried three like this, and eventually found that none of them were herself, and then dressed again and went out of the store.
“She didn’t seem to care who was watching her—or didn’t think of who would eventually buy her underwear she tried through.”
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “I feel nauseous when I think someone will buy underwear that someone else has worn through and hasn’t washed.”
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “Fortunately, after she left, the shopkeeper was obviously going to take care of the underwear.”
“I hated buying a new underwear home, but found another woman trying through and not being washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark already knows what happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All problematic goods have been disposed of.
How to Use Magic to Protect Yourself in a Gun Attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com might give you a little bit of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City, how to deal with gunmen in close proximity.
Whether he’s coming close to you from the front or the back, this video will teach you how to turn to win.
Mizrachi said that if the gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and “clear the fire line.”
Then hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder, and then hit the attacker’s face with your elbow.
Next with his knees on top of his abdomen, when the attacker bends his body from pain, turns the gun in his hand, hits his face with a gunpipe and a reserve rifle, keeping the weapon always directed at him.
If the gunman approaches from the front, a similar technique is used—to keep your body out of the range of the line of fire, pick up the gun and turn the gunhead so that the gunman can’t open fire.
At the same time, press the weight on the gun and hit the attacker’s chest, and turn the gun from his tight hand, then direct the gun towards him.
Sounds very complicated?
Watch the video and see what Mizrachi does.
But remember, if you are not a master of magical arts, the safest way to get rid of the robbery is to give money.
A rogue family destroys a rented home in Saltash, Cornwall, before being expelled
A rogue family who was expelled for intimidating neighbors destroyed the rented home they lived in before leaving, causing a loss of £50,000.
After a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from a rented apartment in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly evacuated from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that it was severely damaged.
There were holes everywhere in the wall, the floor was broken, the garbage was thrown in the ground, and the walls were painted.
After being expelled, the family has been moving and isly currently living in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, Housing Manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said she was worried that the house could no longer be saved.
“It’s a nightmare for those who live here, and I don’t think people can live that way.”
There are a lot of things to weigh now, as this house is likely to be a less good element in Cornwall County.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived here from time to time. Police said the family’s terrorist acts included using baseball sticks to fight on the streets, intimidating residents nearby, using drugs, drug trafficking, screaming, quarrelling and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received an anti-social behavior resolution.
In this house that may have been demolished, many rooms have been stored with garbage for a long time.
In the room where the drug had been trafficked, the floor was lifted up.
Neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the streets and often called the police.
After giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily away, the Cornwall County Housing Association forced her and her husband out of the residence this week.
Finally relaxed neighbors cheered for this, saying that the previous life was simply a human hell.
A neighbor said, “They don’t care about anyone.”
We’ve lived next to them for 20 years and it’s been so bad.
We have seen the police come in a number of times.
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.”
We woke up early because it was too quiet here—we’re not used to it yet!
They finally left, it was great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive manager of the Conval County Housing Cooperative District, said the family was not working well with the local government.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years and the police are frequently visited.
The garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the meadows of the rental house.
He added: “Unfortunately, the tenant was not responsible for her behavior with her family, and the deportation was the ultimate consideration of the Cornwall County Housing Association.”
It was a very difficult case to deal with because their behavior was extremely extreme and what they did had to scare their neighbors.
I’m grateful for the work my team has done, and I’m grateful for DeVincent, the Cornwall County Police, and the community members who have courageously provided us with information.
I hope this move will bring some consolation to our neighbors and send a message that we are not tolerant of anti-social behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all over 20 years old.
After they were evacuated, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
Housing association workers will soon clean up the rubbish around the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found 70 grams of marijuana, as well as scraps, drug use tools and £1,700 in cash.
After confessing his guilt, Skeldon was fined for possession of class B drugs and intended drug trafficking.
She claims that the money was used to buy the tomb of Lee Skeldon, his son who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her husband are now living in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of several rooms in the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will expel tenants who violate tenant rules.
Angela Crow, of the Defense County and Comfort County Police Department, said the deportation issued a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate tenant rules.
“This warning is aimed at those who think their actions will not be blamed, and those who are devastated by such behavior,” she said.
Devon County and the Comfort County Police Department will never tolerate crime and anti-social behavior, and they will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary would nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been blocking confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose him to replace late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Hillary would choose Garland with "some credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reed then said Reed did not know whether or not he would nominate Garland for a direct conversation with Hillary, saying he was just speculating.
He praised Garland and said Hillary’s team didn’t want to be “burdened” by new candidates.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District of Columbia Federal Circuit Court of Appeal.
Reed said the Republicans who blocked Gulland’s nomination were the “lordship” and “achievers” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not suitable for being president.
Treats: Naked Calendar “Loved by Men and Women”
Treats magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere to capture a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than famous naked people.
Steve Shaw, the president of Treats, said earlier this year that their naked-based magazine is different from the old-fashioned Pussy Riot magazine because “the latter is men-oriented.”
We are directed towards women.
Obviously, he thinks this group calendar is the same.
“We need to show the eternal and classic nakedness that makes both women and men feel alive, and this time it’s inspired by that,” Shaw said at a calendar presentation.
Women will be happy to participate in this shooting because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their photo applications online, as well as personally to public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video reports show that small-headed sleeping sharks are the longest-lived vertebrates
Scientists say that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, said the data showed that the age of a female small-headed sleeping shark is expected to range from 272 to 512 years old, up to five meters in length.
French court rejects petition to demolish store in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a petition by the French government to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the "jungle" refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
During the court hearing this week, the Galles government argued that the French government should have the right to demolish a total of 72 temporary shops in the refugee camp, where people sold goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provided hairdressing services, and also sold tea for 50 cents (40 pence) in temporary restaurants or basic meals for a few euros.
The governor’s office believes these places should be demolished as they are non-tax-paying parallel economies with fire and sanitary hazards.
Humanitarian groups said the shops and restaurants were critical to the courts because the free food provided by state-sponsored associations and other groups could not meet the growing needs of the refugee camp.
These temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food for those in need.
A court in Leir ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said Governor Galey’s concerns were “completely understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to refugees who “live in extremely dangerous conditions.”
He said these places are a peaceful gathering point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the areas threatened to be demolished is the Jungle Book Kids coffee shop in the refugee camp, which offers 200 food, English and French lessons a day, as well as advice on asylum for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the café.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure of the cafe “would be a great disaster for these children (many of them are only eight years old).”
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps has surpassed 9000, the highest level since the summer surge in the number of refugees.
“This $5,000 funding has solved my burnout.”
Guo Feng, a girl from Guo Feng County, has received a notice of admission to the University of South China.
Just when she was worried about the admission costs, on August 9, the county committee timely implemented the 5,000 yuan grant.
The relevant departments of the county have also implemented scholarship funding for over 690 poor university students for 283.8 million yuan.
At the same time, especially difficult for the family's economic situation, it is also possible to help them complete their studies through the organization of social donation scholarship.
More than 18.5 million yuan of integrated scholarship funds this year, and more than 2.5 million yuan of self-financing, the financial department puts into the real-name bank card of poor students in accordance with the prescribed time limit.
She said gratefully, "I thought my father had died, my brother and I could not go to college, and I didn't think the county solved the difficulties for us in time."
As of August 8, the company has implemented more than 21 million yuan of various rescue funds for 13,140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All poor students of the county have achieved responsibility and this supplement has been supplemented.

The government of Australia's New South Wales state announced on the 11th that it will invest $200 million (about $1.5 billion) in the largest renovation since the construction of the famous Sydney Opera House.
The New South Wales government said the repair would not change the shell shape of the opera.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney’s landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jon Utsson and built in 1973, receiving about 8 million visitors annually.
Rory Jeffs, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will make a "turning-up battle" with this transformation, becoming "one of the world's best concert halls with sound effects."
Non-Japanese citizens who reside in Kyoto for more than six months and meet one of the conditions for legal stable employment, legal stable residence and continuous study in Kyoto may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the implementation rules of the provisional residence permit regulations in Beijing were introduced, which means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to a "residence permit".
According to the head of the relevant department, the shift from “temporary residence permit” to “residence permit” means that Beijing will shift from “management” to multi-faceted services for non-Japanese permanent residents.
As of the end of June, tax authorities at all levels have published a blacklist of 2, 470 cases of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took the first step in the functional department of the central government and jointly with the Tax Credit Management Measures issued the Measures for Disclosure of Information on Major Tax Violations.
Not only will the facts of these violations, the legal basis, the handling of penalties be disclosed, but the basic information of the parties to the violation and the responsible persons of the relevant intermediary agencies will also be included in the "black list" and exposed.
Quality inspection, finance, customs and other government departments have also taken relevant punitive measures against the "black list" parties.
The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the construction of the entire social credit system, which marks the continuous development and improvement of the construction of our social credit system.
“Environmental problems are expressed in the atmosphere, water, and soil pollution, but the root is still in the way of life produced.”
For example, in 2015, Jiangsu Province's land development rate reached 21%, ranking the highest in all provinces and autonomous regions.
Therefore, the problem of high pollution, high energy, and large land occupation has not yet been fundamentally addressed by changing the way of life in production.
On the one hand, in terms of the results of the creation of various types of ecological environments at various levels in Jiangsu Province, the absolute advantage ranks first in the country; but on the other hand, the pressure on the resource environment is great.
To solidly promote the protection and governance of the ecological environment, it is necessary to fundamentally promote the transformation of the lifestyle of production, and promote the transformation of ecological civilization and benefit people's livelihoods.
On the 11th, at the terminal of the port of Liaoning, the 42 wind-electric leaf boat manufactured by the national electricity group was ready to export to South Africa.

The Olympic Group commissioned a third-party company (non-Chinese companies) to manufacture the flag in São Paulo, Brazil, about 75 km from the city of São Paulo.
In order to urge manufacturers to finish the work as soon as possible, the Chinese Consulate General in Sao Paulo organized special staff to the manufacturer to do the work in depth.
After 30 hours of overtime, the manufacturer has finally completed the production of the Chinese flag and the car will be shipped, which would require four to five working days to complete the task in advance.
It is that the flag is expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th, and the Olympic Committee will receive the flag to various Olympic venues, and the entire process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil.
On the 10th, the government of the city of Nanjing held the Shanghai International Conference Center for Zhongshan industry cooperation and talks, more than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate, and more than 2 billion Zhongshan industry linkage projects were signed on site.
The total investment of 80.6 billion yuan in the 20 projects signed is focused on new energy, new materials, modern services and other industries.
Qingdao is the 12th pilot city in the country and the first in Shandong province to use and trade compensated pollution rights.
On the 11th, several enterprises went to Qingdao City Exhaust Rights Trading Center to submit an exhaust rights application, and will pay a paid use fee after accepting the application.
The imminent completion of the first transaction also indicates the official opening of the Qingdao pollution rights trading pilot, which will also be the first in the province's pollution rights transaction and the first in the nation's city level pollution rights transaction.
On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xuping, general manager of Qingdao Peanut Fine Chemicals (Group) Limited, came to Qingdao City Emissions Rights Trading Center to submit an application for emissions rights.
At the end of last year, the factory in Qingdao's old town area was completely discontinued, and environmental protection was moved to a new factory area.
After Zhao Xiaoping submitted the application form, the environmental impact report of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao City Emissions Rights Reserve and Transaction Services Center began the preliminary examination of the application materials.
According to the imposition criteria determined by Qingdao City's material prices, finance and other departments, the current estimated initial emissions use fee is approximately 64.12 million yuan, and the staff will complete the approval within 7 working days.
The first transaction that will be completed this time also indicates the official opening of the Qingdao pollution rights trading pilot, and will be the first in the province's pollution rights transaction and the first in the nation's city level pollution rights transaction.
Zhao Xiaoping said that at present, enterprise environmental protection has invested up to 4 billion, the surface amount is huge, but the enterprise management concept and social benefits have a great impact, and the enterprise innovation management has also opened up space.
On the same day, Qingdao Qingdao Shinjuku Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. also applied for discharge rights for the annual production of 4,200 high-speed rail and motor vehicle interior accessories projects.
The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprise, the initial pollution allowance applied for chemical oxygen demand (COD) is 0.514 tons / year and ammonia (NOX) is 0.052 tons / year.
The remunerated use and trade of air pollutant emissions rights for key industrial enterprises in the city's supply of electricity and thermal power production.
Existing pollution units that have been reviewed before January 1, 2016 will not be charged a paid use fee.
“A paid right to pollution does not equate to a right to illegal pollution, and pollutants cannot be released arbitrarily.”
Qingdao City Environmental Protection Bureau deputy director Han Red Yuan introduced that if illegal pollution, excess pollution is still to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid punishment by buying pollution rights.
That is, through legal means to strictly combat environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, thereby protecting the environment and safeguarding public health.
Now enterprises have increased the motivation for pollution eradication for their own benefit, cherished limited pollution rights, and reduced pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic interests, reducing pollutant emissions turns from government compulsory behavior to conscious market behavior, thereby truly achieving the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and safeguarding public health.
The right to pollution, also known as the "emission right", is the right to emit pollutants, refers to the right of the emitter to the environment within the limits allocated by the government.
This right is essentially the right of the polluter to own, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step is to adjust the emissions by exchange of currency between the internal polluting sources, provided that the total emissions of pollutants do not exceed permissible amounts.
Since 1968 by the American economist Dales, the United States began to apply it to the management of sources of air and river pollution in the 1970s.
China has been conducting the pilot since 2007, and 14 provinces (districts and cities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu are already fully implemented.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria, several Russian military aircraft provided support from the Syrian air base in Khmeimim.
On February 22, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the conflict in Syria, and the ceasefire agreement came into effect from the 27th of that month.
Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes on terrorist organizations identified by the UN Security Council such as the Islamic State and the Support Front.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure on the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if the extremist forces are not attacked, they will spread to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on jointly combating Syrian extremist forces, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, launched a military strike against Syrian extremist forces.
Russia's main military forces in Syria began to evacuate on March 15, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the air base in Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus.
In the case of old house newborns and successful landscapes, Hobe has done a good demonstration: to inherit a century-old house, but also to tell the story of a piece of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people gather to Bamboo mountain every year, bringing all kinds of ideas or seeking inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the countryside and the city should be accompanied by each other, just like the mother and the child, there is no part of strength and weakness, there is no need for who to rule who, should be very warm.
There is no fixed pattern for rural development, but it is difficult to depend on the spontaneous change of the countryside, and the most important thing should be to get the right people to the countryside.
Shanghai's Matsujiang district trade department recently used electronic police to fix drivers driving and playing mobile phones, capturing more than 30 cases in a week.
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, microblogging, microblogging and even playing games, surfing the treasures are normal, many people seem to have to stay away from their phones, even when driving can not stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits driving from playing mobile phones, and defines it as “impeding safe driving behavior.”
Unfortunately, due to the number of offenders, the difficulty of obtaining evidence, etc., this phenomenon has not been punished, and the legal provisions are almost set.
If the administrative department can make a determination to "declar war" against the behavior of driving and playing mobile phones, and normalize this measure, this illegal behavior can be contained.
It is necessary to strictly manage household records, establish electronic and paper archives for the account registration materials of non-accounted persons, and ensure that the archive data is complete and effective.
The public security organs shall handle the registration of the account of non-accounted persons and inform the relevant departments in a timely manner.
Policy measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of this Implementation Opinion will be subject to a centralized clearance, with the amendment being substantially amended and the cancellation resolutely abrogated.
In a collective shelf in the East Lin Village in Taira City, 48-year-old Wang Sheffield was taking workers to spray pesticides on pear trees.
The entire village has 150 acres of fruit gardens, more than 10 species of trees, only 12 workers plus one technical engineer.
A total of $50,000 last year, like my age, would not get that money if I worked in the factory.
Last year, the rural income of the village reached 22 million yuan, of which agriculture accounts for half of the total income.
The per capita land cultivation area is increasing every year, just starting with 50 acres, and now it is more than 100 acres; the per-acre profit is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers also has room for growth every year.
The biggest highlight of the collective economic reform in the rural areas of Sunan is the clarity of the ownership of rural collective operating assets and the exploration of political and economic separation.
In July 2015, the 14 rural economic cooperation organizations and the village committees "shared accounts management", the village committees carry out rural public affairs management, and the cooperation organizations are mainly engaged in business.
The two institutions have two accounts, each other does not "set boundaries", to prevent the corruption of village cadres from participating in collective asset management.
The Deputy Director of the Agricultural Commission of Jiangsu Province, Shizouping, said that the next step of Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of the community share cooperation system, encourage the joint development of farmers, and establish a democratic power operation mechanism at the village level.
We will further advance the reform, engage in community share cooperation, quantify assets to employees, fix them to farmers, and form clear property rights.

Xiamen girl Zhang Bin: "Beautiful hands" began the path of shooting career after several "reversal"
Zhang Dong-red of the East Park village in Xiamen Liang An district just replaced the old 29 inch TV in his home with a 65-inch big TV a few days ago.
The daughter of the ordinary farmer is Zhang Binh, who on the evening of 11 won the silver medal in the final of the Rio Olympic Games for women's 50 meters rifle.
On the night of the 11th, just in front of this new television, Zhang and several dozens of close relatives and friends, together witnessed the daughter on the road to struggle to pursue, from almost the pre-game was eliminated to almost the magical process of reversal.
In the game of the day, Zhang Binbin once down in the ranking, it seemed to be very far from the final.
But parents and family and friends did not give up, continuously printed the text live broadcast, and saw as other players finished the game, Zhang Bin named up and up, eventually locked the final seat, his house broke out of a shout of cheers.
In the final, Zhang Bin again in the case of one ranking behind, the last shot more and more stable, only with the backward champion 0.2 ring score won the silver medal.
This year is 27 years old, Zhang Bin, in the 16 years of shooting career, in fact, several times almost wiped up with this difficult silver card.
His mother, Zhang Xiao Long, told reporters that just when they hesitated, Zhang Bin sought a few "novel guests" from the village.
These "novel guests" were the village children who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Bin's cousin.
Shortly after joining Xiamen, Zhang Bin again returned to Lian's school for family difficulties and other reasons.
But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yai repeatedly did the job, Zhang Bin returned to Xiamen again.
And after entering the province, Zhang Bin once again returned home because of the delay in entering the national team, once because of the lack of hope.
This time, not only Zhang Jae, the Xiamen Shotgun Sports Center and the leadership and coach of the Fujian province came home, and eventually persuaded Zhang Binh to return to the province.
Just like yesterday's race, this Xiamen girl's insistence made a reversal on the way of shooting.
“Every coach has a different way of selecting a team member, and when I saw that the hands were beautiful, it suddenly came out.”
Zhang also recalled that in the training test, although the daughter's results are not the best, but the number of rings played is stable, which is also an important reason why Zhang has attracted coaches.
During the training of Zhang Binh, Zhang Yaize was most impressed by the contribution of this farmer girl.
He recalled that Zhang Binh entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, and the team carried out persistent gun lifting training, requiring the team members not to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiao Long told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and nice child, since childhood she loved to paint and make handmade toys.
“Of course I’ll make clothes at home, sew fillings, and Bin Bin will pick up some edges to make myself a doll.”
She said her daughters often sew their own hand-made toys, plus she is good at painting, from dolls to costumes, always make it look alive.
As an athlete, Zhang Bin and his family gather less and more, only on holidays can go home, usually by phone contact.
The parents said that whether it was meeting or calling, Zhang Bin rarely talked about his hard work, more about talking to his parents about some fun things.
Usually not seeing the daughter, the parents carefully stored the paintings of the daughter's childhood and the honor of the years in the house.
Zhang Xiao Long showed her daughter as an animated comic book to reporters, "if she wasn't a shooter athlete, she should still continue to paint."
And in the living room on the second floor of Zhang Bin, there was a closet filled with the medals, medals and certificates she received.
Zhang Dong Red placed the medals and medals together, and the certificate was unified in the folder and preserved, "these are honors that have been exchanged for ten years, and we are very cherished."
Recently, the Hebei province charity fund sent 16,000 yuan of condolences to the hands of six lost families in the villages such as Tianhe, Tianhe, Huizhou and other villages.
This is another compassionate care campaign that the fund sends to society in search of the revelation of “Lost Adolescents and Lonely Elders in the 7.19 Flood.”
The heavy rains caused many disasters in Hebei province, resulting in flooding disasters in parts of the province, and deaths and disappearances.
The good man "old iron" for helping the district's duty to drain the water unfortunately sacrificed, leaving a 2-year-old young child and a wife with six armor, the feelings of the good man "old iron" touched the whole province.
On August 4, the staff of the Charity Fund of Hebei Province and the volunteers of the Hebei Brand Association came to the home of the good man "old iron" and handed 3,200 yuan of love to the family of "old iron".
When branding association vice president Yelli learned of the status quo of the "old iron" family, he immediately decided to carry out the "love and mercy sale" activity in the branding association's enterprise members to help the "old iron" family to share difficulties.
The Hebei Charity Fund, wholly known as the Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation and Charity Fund, was initiated by the Hebei Brand Association Preparatory Committee and was established in August 2015.
According to the Hong Kong "Eastern Daily" on August 12, the current mainland diamond sales are said to have three major problems, including the purity of false diamonds pushing the sale price, the weight of false diamonds, and the lack of guarantee after sale.
And Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, the local craftsmen's diamond cutting technology is famous, the diamonds sold are strictly identified, and are popular with mainland ladies.
“A small cloth bag, holding in the hand, a slightly floating piece, worth a million yuan,” Liu’s grandmother, who participated in the purchase of diamonds, described to the mainland media her experience in Antwerp in June this year.
She alleged that she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the toilet and took a shower for several days, and was very nervous when she went to sleep.
She said the diamonds purchased in Antwerp cost about fifty-five thousand yuan per carat, and the quality diamonds were sold at a retail price of about eleven thousand yuan in Xiamen.
She recently increased the purchase price by two per cent, sold all the diamonds she purchased, and earned 200,000 yuan at a time.
According to the customs regulations of the mainland, diamond non-passenger supplies or necessary goods in the journey, therefore belong to the category of goods, must be declared at the time of entry, otherwise or listed as smuggling, the situation can be seriously sentenced to prison.
According to foreign media reports, on 10 local time, the British prime minister's residence, Downing Street, announced that British Prime Minister Theresa May will be in Switzerland for a summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place of vacation.
According to some media, after the Brexit referendum, the new British prime minister chose to go on holiday to the "neutral country" of the European continent in Switzerland, with some political symbolism.
The Guardian commented that the symbolism represented by the neutral country of Switzerland played a role in the choice of the British prime minister's first vacation.
The British Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May chose to go on holiday to Switzerland, which is the first time since Mrs. Thatcher that the British prime minister has been on holiday to Switzerland.
The choice of the two female prime ministers and the preference of the two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, for a vacation in hotter places formed a contrast.
New British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to return to London on August 24, after a series of important tasks and events await her.
The UK Parliament will meet again on September 5th, and the topics of the debate include an online request for a second Brexit referendum.
In a referendum on June 23, the UK decided to leave the EU, but the new Prime Minister did not want to initiate Article 50 of the relevant member states of the Lisbon Treaty before the end of the year.
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan City, both in kind and quantity, ranked first in the province.
Since the non-genetic heritage of the emblem culture is mainly dependent on oral face-to-face teaching, many non-genetic heritages are at risk of disappearance, the use of digital technology preservation and protection is imperative.

China’s Mars is here.
China's Mars exploration mission is to circumnavigation, landing, and surveillance at a time, a form that has never been seen abroad.
The mission of our country's Mars exploration launches is to circumnavigate, land, and explore, this task has a considerable difficulty.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are strictly working out the engineering plan to fight for the launch of our first Mars probe in this window in 2020.
Although China's spacecraft has entered deep space, the completion of the Mars exploration mission is still indispensable, and the exploration of Mars means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration in the real sense.
“Only once every two or three years, there is a chance for Mars to be closest to Earth to launch a Mars spacecraft at this time, which is the most energy-efficient time for a launching rocket.”
"Given the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by our Long March V rocket."
China's Mars exploration mission is to realize the circumference, landing, surveillance, this form is never seen abroad, abroad has planned to realize the circumference and landing, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical fields, the special thing is that although the Mars vehicle is a space probe, it has distinct characteristics compared to the general space probe.
That is, the Mars probe should have the ability to determine the route and detect obstacles.
Pong Ho, a researcher at the Five Houses of China’s Space and Technology Group, said that humanity so favoured Mars exploration because it has important scientific, technological and other significance, and even related to the future of mankind.
At present, Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human study besides Earth, and the history of human use of spacecraft for Mars exploration has gone through almost the entire history of human space.
Therefore, humans hope that one day they will build a residential base on Mars and eventually migrate to Mars, making it a second home for humans.
There is a lot of evidence that suggests that Mars may have previously looked like Earth today, only after billions of years of evolution to become a thin atmosphere, lower temperatures, and exhaustion of water.
Thus, exploring or manned landing on Mars could suggest a plan to prevent Earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, 114 lunar missions and 43 Mars missions were conducted worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to the present day, humans have conducted 18 Mars exploration missions, while only 14 have been conducted on the moon.
There are currently five Mars orbits and two Mars rover vehicles in work, but only one moon orbiter and one moon lander are working.
The world's space powers have developed plans to target the Mars system, which shows that today's Mars exploration is warmer than the moon exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars spacecraft, Bangalore, becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
The "Bangarian" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars to explore whether there is methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult part of the mission is that the probe has only one chance to slow down after entering the atmosphere of Mars and the parachute.
According to Sun Zhejiang, chief designer of the Mars probe at the five-hour general department of China Space Science and Technology Group, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very low, with only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface with a high level of uncertainty.
Factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm, scientists have no comprehensive knowledge.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth's dust weather in the summer, which leads to a sharp drop in solar energy received by the Mars vehicle, and it must be designed a "sleep" pattern for the Mars vehicle to wait patiently for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which creates difficulties with the energy supply for Mars's exploration.
This requires a larger area of the solar wing of the probe, and needs to be constantly adjusted to work towards the sun.
Moreover, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38 percent that of Earth, but it is much greater than the surface gravity of the moon, so the probe needs more power.
“The most central and most difficult part of this Mars exploration mission is the process of the detector entering the atmosphere of Mars and the deceleration of the parachute landing, and there is only one chance to ensure success.”
Sun Zee said that because the Earth is far from Mars, the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it has to rely on the probe to do it independently.
Because there are not so many propellants to offset such high speeds, when landing on Mars, the deceleration depends on the action of the Mars atmosphere, but the Mars atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, the way to explore Mars is similar to the way to explore the moon, it is also "round, fall, orbit, and back", ultimately achieving the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Since Mars is much further away from Earth than the Moon is from Earth, exploring Mars requires a series of more complex technical challenges.
According to Taiwan media reports, Taiwan's "administrative dean" Lin Feng announced yesterday morning that "the regulations on the improper acquisition of assets by political parties and their affiliated organizations" came into force today.
Vice-Chairman of the National Party, Jianxiang, said: "A national party with more than a hundred years of history, with social commitments and responsibilities, will not collapse in this way."
If political parties, affiliated organizations or trustees violate the prohibition of punishment stipulated in the regulations, the committee will investigate according to its authority and punish or punish "in accordance with law".
Lin Feng has also announced that he is not eligible for the candidate for deputy chairman of the Party Production Committee, and will be appointed by Humbeghan, deputy chairman of the Taiwan "Intimate Administration".
He said that Zhou Liu Yuan served as the chairman of the Committee on Inappropriate Party Production, and borrowed from Hubei's past experience in investigating relevant major cases, will serve as the basis for the commission to clear up related inappropriate party productions.
Jiang Qing believes that today as long as there is party production, no one will give you social contributions, if the party production is completely taken away, the National Party can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "today there is really no chance to ask."
He also stressed that even after the party production regulations did not come on the road, the party's production was not fully public, confiscated, and the remainder would still be donated according to the promise, so that the party's output rate would be zero, and the party would start everything from scratch.
The original title: "Corridor Doctor" Lang-Viet Peak appeals to the chairman of Wang Zhi An's honor infringement lawsuit
The legal evening news because of the speech of Wang Zhiang, the central television host, about the "corridor doctor" incident on the Xinhua microblog, Lan Wei Feng appealed to the court for Wang Zhiang and Beijing Micromania Network Technology Co., Ltd.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian court issued a verdict on the case, ruling that Wang Zhiang and Micromania Company did not constitute an infringement, and rejected the entire litigation request of Lang.
In early 2014, CNN journalist Wang Zhiang’s investigation found that despite more than 600 days of sitting in the hospital corridor, Lanzhou Peak was shaped by the media as a sad hero who was suppressed by the regime, but the reports contained a lot of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the program "Corridor Doctor" produced by Central TV News Investigation was broadcast.
The various allegations of so-called overmedication to the media are not supported by evidence.
Wang Zhiang also described in the microblog, which certified his real name, "The reason Lan-Viet Peak has come to this step is because of the character, which has a clearly paranoid personality, etc."
Lanzhou Feng asked Wang Zhiang to remove the microblog, apologize to it and compensate for the moral damage of 100,000 yuan.
During the trial at the time, the two sides argued over whether Wang Zhiang violated the reputation rights of Lantai Peak.
On the 12th, the Chinese team was busy with four bicycles hoping to break through.
Bicycles are expected to the Olympic gold "zero breakthrough", and women's football girls will challenge the two-time world championship team of Germany, looking forward to exploding cold rush into the four strongest.
Wang Town two seasons state highlighted, last year in Beijing field world championship harvested silver medals, this year in May group competition world championship again upgraded personal project championship.
According to foreign media reports, the 27-year-old Korean shooter Zhang Huijin won the gold medal in the women's shooter individual competition, and after the group competition won the Olympic gold medal, becoming the double crown king.
Zhang Heijing is considered a late athlete, she once regretted not to get a ticket for the last London Olympics, but now proudly stands on the highest prize table of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huizhou won the gold medal in the final of the women's shooter individual in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, defeating Germany's Lisa O'Neal with a total score of 6–2.
She first shot in her fourth grade at elementary school and won her first personal gold medal at the World Cup until she was 27, in 2014, as a later famous athlete.
Zhang Huijin recalled, "There was no level before high school so that it was not possible to participate in national competitions.
Zhang Huijin won only fourth place in the London Olympic competition four years ago, regretless of losing the Olympic entrance ticket, he can only sit and watch his colleagues and good friends double two gold medals.
Zhang Huijin said after the award ceremony of the women's shooter individual contest, "Until the end, as much as possible, a single shot, probably this brought good results, and I am satisfied."
The 28-year-old Korean shooter "Sister" and London Olympic shooter individual gold medal winner Chihuahua won the bronze medal.
Chihuahua lost to Zhang Huizhou in the semi-finals, competing against Mexican player Alejandra Valencia in bronze medals.
Chippe was in the tears of the court after ensuring the bronze card, the burden of the mortgage that was silently borne can be imagined.
First, the instructor team has accumulated a wealth of experience in continuous research, and then the scientific training methods, which need to be accumulated over the long term.
The shooters helped the crew to concentrate and maintain a normal mind by means of military training and night crossing through the cemetery.
Although it hasn’t been confirmed yet, many sources say that Apple’s autumn 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
Although Apple has not responded, there have been successive news about the new iPhone's functionality and configuration, and even on the Internet there are images of the iPhone 7 "real machine model".
The new generation of iPhones can be called "World Observation", hot, tight, wealthy ... if you want to buy the original product for the first time, be sure to choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This exacerbates people’s disappointment with the new phone, “it’s extended, but can’t project a holographic image at all!
The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, was accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, several sources have claimed that the next generation of iPhones will remove the 3.5mm headphone interface, instead of using Bluetooth connectivity and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence that supports the news is that Apple allowed headphone manufacturers to manufacture headphone products that were connected via a charging interface in 2014.
Whether the news is true or false, the answer will not be revealed until Apple’s autumn 2016 release.
But that doesn’t stop industry viewers from looking forward to the iPhone 7 – many believe that the iPhone 7 is likely to be Apple’s last major upgrade to the iPhone series.
According to recent data released by the market research agency IDC, the iPhone’s market share has declined.
Among them, Goldman Sachs hasined Apple’s “buy” rating, while BMO analysts believe the iPhone 7 will reap a historic sales record.
Hock Tan, CEO of Booth, said Apple’s future revenue growth is likely to be more than 20 percent, which is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had an intention to buy an iPhone 7, compared to just four percent of those who planned to buy an iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of users who currently own the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage.
Second, there is an analysis of experts that most of the powder likes to replace their iPhone phones in different generations.
According to statistics, of all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not replaced the phone for 2 years, that is, almost 1,2 million iPhone users have used it for 2 years.
According to the media, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes during the iPhone 7 production period, "Taiwan's production facility has been damaged beyond imagination and may have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
Supply and demand contradictions can affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time to buy the original iPhone 7.
According to informed sources, in recent years, Suning's senior staff frequently met with Apple, with the aim of preparing adequate supplies.
Operators have negotiated with Suning, and it is foreseeable that with deep cooperation between the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more attentive services to users.
“At the lowest price, consumers could buy an iPhone 7 for just $7 a day.”
A sufficient supply and a variety of offers, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "stress", and Suning's logistics, will turn this beauty into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you’ll get a phone call in the middle of the night, “Hello, Sunny Buy, your iPhone 7 is here.”
Through the exhibition, the organizers hope to enable local people to learn more about historic Chinese culture, thereby fostering mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona’s “Mini Art Exhibition” is part of the European Tour and will last until early October.

According to foreign media reports, due to the water of the jumping pool from blue to green, the Rio Olympic "green pool" event has recently received external attention.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water in the waterball competition pool adjacent to the jumping pool also turned green.
The Australian waterballer said after the match that his eyes were stinging and wanted to shed tears.
Earlier, officials at the Rio Olympics confirmed the situation of pool water greening and said the pool water coloring was due to the weakening of alkaline nature and would not affect the athlete's health.
But the Australian athlete, after winning a game with the Japanese national team in the waterball pool, said his eyes were stinging.
Early after the water became green in the jumping pool, the competition organizer dealt with the problem of the jumping pool overtime on the night of 9th, but the colour of the waterball pool also changed rapidly on the morning of 10th.
During the Australian-Japanese match, the waterball pool’s environmental conditions gradually deteriorated, but the official said they would restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colour on the 11th.
Rio Olympics spokesman Mario Andrada said: “Yesterday afternoon, the alkalinity of the swimming pool first weakened.”
“We’ve learned a series of reasons that can cause pool water to color, as well as the alkalinity of water.”
The water sports center carried out a series of tests on water quality, with hundreds of divers and swimmers using the pool to determine the water quality conditions to meet the standards.
“These days we’ve been on the normal process, but we may have ignored the more possible impact athletes have on water quality.”
“But the change in water color has no effect on health, especially for athletes.”
“This independent team confirms our assessment and the measures we have taken to restore the pool to its normal colour and chemical status.”
“We would have hoped the swimming pool would return to normal colour in the morning, but the pace of recovery was affected by the rain.”
According to the Taiwan "Central Agency", an explosion occurred in the outskirts of a prison in the region of Damanila last night, injuring the chief of the prison, 10 prisoners died,ly including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN television that the incident took place at the Paranaque prison around 9 p.m. yesterday, but police did not make a preliminary statement until 2 p.m. today.
Police said the 10 prisoners appealed to the chief of the prison and filed a complaint about the transfer of supervisors, but the two sides did not speculate, with prisoners throwing hand grenades, leading to an explosion.
Prisoners have not yet released the names of the dead prisoners, but GMA television that there were two Chinese prisoners.
As of 8 a.m., prisoners had not yet provided detailed explanations, including how the prisoners had obtained a hand grenade.
Yesterday, central Philippine police entered a prison in the province of Leite, killing a prisoner who “tried to attack the police.”
Urumqi regulates tourism tourism market operation order travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
At present, Xinjiang has entered the tourism season, in order to regulate the business order of the tourism market, the tourism law enforcement branch of the Urumqi city's Joint City Transport Administration law enforcement branch yesterday on the tourist car presence in the tourist market, the travel agency and tourists signed the contract rate is low to investigate.
Around eight o’clock yesterday morning, about 10 buses were stopped around the Kempinski Hotel, most of which were buses for a day trip to the Sky Pool.
“Hello, I’m from the Urumqi City Tourism Office, have you signed a contract with this travel agency?”
Employees of the law enforcement branch of the Urumqi Municipal Administration said: "Extraterrestrial tourist cars and buses operate tourist transportation projects in the Urumqi market, there are no qualifications for practice."
"Over-range operation for this penalty of three to hundred thousand, driver without a license is a fine of 2,000 yuan."
It is understood that the tourism law enforcement department of the city of Urumqi has previously carried out inspections in places such as West Park and Red Mountain.
Combined the two inspections, the deputy captain of the tourism law enforcement division of the city of Urumqi said: "The first is safety, the second is regulation, tourist vehicles are no small thing, once the problem is all the crowd wounded death."
"We and the operator jointly continue to inspect the market and regulate the conduct of travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the morning of August 12, the State Council Press Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
A spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and head of the National Economy Comprehensive Statistics Division said that in July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed, but still operates in a reasonable range.
The data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that figures such as fixed asset investment growth rate and total imports declined in July.
Regarding the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a phrase that the Prime Minister once said "the shape is volatile, the trend is still in good direction", which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that “formal volatility” means that some economic indicators indeed declined in July.
Because the domestic and foreign economy is still in the deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and changing, and the world economy's recovery is not as expected, so the export pressure is still large.
From the domestic perspective, the entire economy is still in a critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is being released, and the economy is facing no small downward pressure, so some indicators are somewhat fluctuating.
In July, there is a special situation, the flood disaster is more severe, and the hot and hot weather has brought some impact on the production and operation of some areas.
According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country were affected by the disaster, and direct economic losses exceeded 200 billion yuan.
These regions are affected to varying degrees by indicators related to industry, investment, and transportation.
In July, freight traffic increased by 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, with flooding disasters having some impact on traffic in these areas.
In terms of these factors, the fluctuation in some indicators in July is also normal and is expected.
He said that "the trend is still good" refers to the fact that despite the economic growth rate has declined, but the overall economic operation is smooth, there is a steady progress and a steady trend toward good has not changed.
In July, the CPI increased by 1.8%, the ratio increased by 0.2%; in July, the CPI increased by 2.1%, so the price situation is generally stable.
According to the Chongqing City Meteorological Bureau portal of the statistics on the high temperature of the county in various districts, in addition to Chongqing, the rest of our city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have defined the standards for granting grants, but the standards issued by municipalities are not the same, while Chongqing receives high-temperature grants according to the high-temperature working day grants.
35 ° C or above 37 ° C or below, not less than 10 yuan standard per person per day; 37 ° C or above, not less than 15 yuan standard per person per day.
High-temperature employees above 40 ° C may receive a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan per day (except for workers who have already high-temperature job allowance in accordance with the law).
According to this criterion, last month's high-temperature days in Kashmir can receive 330 yuan, the lowest number of days in the city is 80 yuan, and the highest temperature in Chongqing because it does not meet the high-temperature standard, there is no high-temperature allowance.
In the past, many units will pay high-temperature subsidies for cooling drinks, and the Municipal Security Supervision Bureau said this behavior is not in line with the current measures.
Where the work is stopped or the working hours are shortened due to hot weather, the employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers.
If employees encounter high-temperature work but do not receive high-temperature allowance, they can seek legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the enterprise is located, or call 12333 complaints.
Where the employing unit refuses to issue the high temperature allowance, the worker may complain to the competent department for human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the work is located.
At the same time, because the high-temperature subsidy is a part of the wage, not benefits, it should be included in the total wage amount and deducted individual taxes.
Therefore, the high-temperature allowance is not within the scope of the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash, and can not be replaced with physical products such as drinks.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high-speed railway district of the city of Urumqi, with a total building area of about 100,000 square meters.
The ground 1 and 2 floors are for entrance stations, waiting halls and office and commercial rooms, and the ground floor 1 is the exit floor.

Both stations are now available for ticketing, the train time between them is about 10 minutes, and passengers need to pay attention to the specific stop names for the start and end of the ticket.
The official operation of Urumqi new passenger station will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national integrated transportation city, promote the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the construction of new districts.
Gracia is a germinating female giant-mouthed bird that spreads the breath of the tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the big mouthed bird Gracia and its story has long been known.
At a press conference on August 10, post-operative rehabilitation Gracia finally debuted, showing people its brand new 3D printed plastic birdflies.
This giant mouthbird, which was crushed and crushed a year and a half ago, has finally been revived.
This day not only announced that it had 100% recovered from health, but also the day it moved into a luxurious birdhouse and met with human friends who cared for it.
The initial new home, Gracia, was slightly upset, but not often became vibrant, rolling in the basin and eating grapes with new grapes.
To remind people of the injuries it once suffered, the technicians did not color it newly, but instead retained the original white of the 3D printed material.
Outside the bird's neck is a thin layer of corneal neck, empty inside, and there are only a few thin bone supports that are crossed.
Despite this internal reinforcement component, big mouth bird's hips are still fragile and break when injured.
Animal Rescue Centers, bird scientists and a US 3D printing company have worked together to create a number of "experimental spiders" for Grace, finally creating the "perfect spiders" for her.
Now, Gracia has been able to use the new grain to drink water, eat, and even harvest small grains.
“The final product was designed for about two months and printed for just four or five hours.”
“3D printing is not the technology of the future, it is already really entering your life and my life,” said Thomas Lang, chairman of SG3D Printing Company in an interview with international reporters in Xinjiang.
In January 2015, in a farm in the province of Gracia in central Costa Rica, a blood-borne giant bird, Gracia, was discovered.
At that time its upper corner was brutally broken by a group of young men, it was completely unable to eat and its life was in danger.
Grazia’s disaster, by the media, has sparked voices of opposition to animal abuse both inside and outside Costa Rica.
They demand tougher animal protection laws and tougher punishment for abuse.
People came spontaneously to do their utmost to help Grace recover from her previous injuries as much as possible.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was involved in the design of the Gracia Upper.
“The situation in Gresia is very special, with the remaining part of its upper corner less than 1 cm, so it poses many difficulties for the installation of the new corner.”
“We first scanned Gracia, then designed and produced an extension prototype slightly longer than the remainder of the shell, fixed on the shell with clay.”
“That could reduce further invasive sexual injury to Gresia,” Long told international reporters in Xinjiang.
Before the prototype was installed, the staff cleaned the cracks for Grace every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of Big Bang Grace touched the famous documentary director Tula Heredia and explorer news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded a little bit of Gracia’s installation and recorded a documentary titled “The Land of the Big Mouth Birds” that was aired on Animal Planet channel this month.
The documentary “The Country of the Big Mouth” shows how a small big mouthbird can change a country for it, and how people can participate in the fight against animal abuse.
Japanese oil companies are wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as "tea cottage."
Japanese media on August 12 that Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn."
Japanese oil companies are cautious about the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as "tea cottage."
China's quality of oil products is gradually approaching Japanese oil products due to the Chinese government's strengthening of environmental protection regulations.
Prior to obtaining a permit for importing crude oil, the "Tea Tree Refinery" generally refined heavy oil with a high sulphur content from countries such as Russia.
The high sulfur content of petroleum products produced, and poor oil products, became one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a crude oil import permit, the Tea Tree Refinery was able to import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil with a lower sulphur content, and the quality of its petroleum products was also improved.
The company said: "As China's domestic oil product quality standards continue to improve, the capacity of refining equipment has also improved.
As a result, the quality of China’s exports gradually reached the same level as (the world’s highest quality) Japan.”
JX Energy said, “After the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia,” competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although “Japanese high-end oil” is facing a crisis, the Japanese oil companies’ response strategy is only to “export to profitable regions while paying attention to market conditions.”
Due to the huge impact of China's oil exports on the Asian market, the attention of the tea canine refineries is also increasing.
In 2016, the Sunlight Scholarship operation launched on May 26, after two months of enrollment, the total number of poor scholars who applied for scholarship reached more than 800.
In the course of the scholarship, more than 1.2 million yuan (which has been distributed into five batches) have been received in social contributions, which can help at least 240 students from the Yellow Dream University.
Currently, donations are still ongoing, and the report calls on society to continue helping more children with family difficulties to receive funding and social care.
In order to ensure fairness, openness and transparency of the activities of the school, from today on, this newspaper will distribute the basic information of the students, and today will publish the 1st to 100th, and will be supervised by the readers.
The Sunlight Assistance Operation is a well-known charity brand in China, and the Sunlight Assistance Operation has been carried out in Jiangsu since 2003, funding more than 4,000 students in poverty.
The scope of funding of the activity is the admission of new students for undergraduate studies, excluding the specialization free of tuition fees; quality education and excellence, family poverty.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, New Zealand’s population growth has exceeded two percent during peak births in 1974 and in the early 1950s and 1960s.
As of June this year, New Zealand's net immigration flows amounted to 6,91 million over the past 12 months, becoming the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, in the same period, New Zealand's population naturally increased by 2.8 million.
The data show that in the last 10 years, the average annual net flow of immigrants to New Zealand was 2,18 million, with the average annual natural population growth of 3,23 million.
From a demographic perspective, the large influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the “working-age population” aged 15 to 39 is gradually expanding.
In the 12-month period as of June 2016, New Zealand’s working-age population grew by 3.6 percent to 15.8 million.
At the same time, the increase in the elderly population over the age of 65 was also 3.6%, reaching 700,000.
At about 10 a.m. yesterday, the X9003 international freight flight departed from Xi'an New Construction Station to Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The launch of the train marks the success of the Xi'an Railway Administration to pass 10,000 cars since the opening of the Central Asian international freight line in 2013.
It is understood that the category of goods transported in this freight line covers six categories of industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial parts, building materials, food, light industry products, a total of 206 varieties.
As of August 11, this year, the new construction station opened a total of 221 routes and 10009 vehicles in Central Asia, cumulative shipment of export goods of 33,8 million tons, of which in 2016 opened 84 routes, an increase of 47%.
It is understood that the first shipment of goods in Central Asia was "Made in Shaanxi", and now it has attracted a large number of foreign goods.
As of the end of July, the number of containers in the Central Asian line to the shipment volume exceeded 64,000, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2015.
With the encryption of the Central Asian line, the volume of cargo shipments by the Xi'an Railway Bureau to new stations increased year by year.
In 2015, the new construction station's annual freight traffic volume was 247,7 million tons, and as of August 10, 2016, the freight shipment volume had reached 153,1 million tons, up 6.7% from the same period last year.
In order to meet the needs of future development, the Xi'an Railway Bureau has launched a plan for the construction of a comprehensive logistics center for Xi'an Railway with a new construction station as the center, and has made all efforts to create a modern comprehensive logistics park for the new construction railway.
An Indian uncle who had just experienced an airplane crash at Dubai International Airport last week won a $1 million prize at the same airport this week.
The long-lived Dubai Indian, Muhammad Bashir Abdul Hiddar, has the habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns home.
His 21-year-old son was paralyzed by an accidental fall when he was 13 days old, and he worked hard to repay his son’s medical loan.

Although it is now autumn, but the power of "Autumn Tiger" does not seem to be much worse than in the summer.
Ultraviolet rays not only make the students' skin dark, but also damage the skin, how can the skin pass the military training smoothly and not get sunburned?
Sunscreen packaging is generally marked with SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sun protection index, is for UVB ultraviolet rays, our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50 and so on.
Products marked with PA are aimed at UVA, so that sunscreen will play a more effective role, usually the strength of PA is used to indicate that more than one + indicates an extension of effective protection time.
The oily skin should choose waterproof sunscreen with strong penetration, and sunscreen spray is also a good option.
Dry skin should choose cream-shaped sunscreen; neutral skin generally has no strict regulations, sensitive skin wipes on any maintenance products are a burden, and it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as it takes time for sunscreen products to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training day sun time is longer, sunscreen rub once every two hours to have a lasting effect, do not be lazy.
Because the skin has just been irritated by the sun, do not immediately use white products.
After the military training exposure to the sun, if possible, with a towel wrapped in ice to ice the burned skin to slow the local dry heat.
Farmers who purchase farm machinery during the exhibition will continue to implement the cumulative subsidy policy, and farmers who purchase farm machinery will receive a subsidy of up to 40%.
This exhibition is aimed at global tendering, in particular, increased the invitation to the countries along the "Belt and Road" and target market countries.
The exhibition strives to complete 60 tender signing projects, introduce funds of 220 billion yuan, sign trade contracts of more than 160, the contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is that the reason for the "Shu Expo" for 7 consecutive years is due to the strong base of manufacturing industry in Hunan province, Hunan city, and the long history of industrial development.
As the host of the "Shanghai Expo", Shandong has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The "Shanghai Expo" has become an important platform for cultivating local characteristics industry development and promoting characteristics industry to come out of the country.
At some nights, the ionic layer is filled with free electrons, which means that radio signals can go even further.
According to the US Monthly Science website on August 11, the U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating this effect.
While the ionic layer with stable amounts of free electrons could help people listen to the radio station on the edge of a university radio station, this may not be in the interest of the U.S. Air Force.
The ionized layer filled with electron means that the radio used by the military has a larger transmission range, and it may provide some protection to the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals against the effects of solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cubic satellites on demand that can strengthen the ionic layer when needed.
But first, the teams that have contracts with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles work.
Industry data show that in 2015, the total capacity of coal production reached 6 billion tons, and the national coal production capacity exceeded 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notifications on eliminating excess and backward production capacity.
Although the first four times were not targeted at the coal industry, the target industry was directly linked to the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the price of Qin's 5,500 truck-powered coal for a long time wandered at the low of 370 yuan / ton, and 90% of coal enterprises fell into losses.
Since February, the price of coal has gradually recovered, and in recent years the price of Qin Dynamic Coal has risen four consecutive rounds, rising to the highest point in 16 months, climbing to 436 yuan per ton, up almost 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As prices recover, concerns arise: will a batch of small coal mines be restored?
In this regard, the head of China (Hainan) Institute of Reform and Development Economics wisdom analyzed and interpreted.
Qing Shui: the production capacity has attracted high attention from all parties, and the record of the production capacity of the coal industry published today has indeed made everyone more concerned.
These three superficial factors also reflect the reason why our growth patterns in the past have been relatively backward, and that the government-led growth patterns have not yet undergone a fundamental shift.
Second, this is also directly related to the local government's efforts to promote, in the process of de-capacity, the funds and corresponding supporting measures must be in place, from this point of view, the differences between the different regions are indeed larger.
Third, if some of the provinces that are currently progressing relatively slowly move ahead in the second half of the year, they may be at greater risk.
In this case, relying on central reward subsidies to advance the process of de-capacity may have a certain negative impact.
First, the production capacity is not simply the total quantity control.
Our goal is to eliminate backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure, and re-construct the whole coal industry.
In the process of deployment of de-capacity, local governments must combine the de-capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry, and vigorously develop the related service industry.
Second, in order to complete this year's capacity decommissioning task, we must still make full use of the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the underlying role of social security.
Since the market is directly related to employment, we need to strengthen employment skills training for our employees and employees.
“The decline in the rankings is due to the deterioration of foreign investment expectations for Brazil’s GDP growth in the medium term.”
In 2015, Brazil’s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 percent, down from 5.7 percent in 2014.
The Swiss Investment Attraction Index consists of four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment volume.
In 2015, Brazil’s international direct investment was $646 billion, down from $731 billion in 2014.
Last year, green investment in Brazil (an investment model for establishing factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, down 2.1% compared to the same year.
There are 288 green space investments in Brazil, compared to an annual average of 314 between 2003 and 2014.
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $38.8 billion, up almost 10 percent from the same period last year.
Canadian Police Killed ISIS Supporters: Homemade Bomb Attacks on Burma Preparation Work Close to End
The taxi company said the taxi was transferred to Deliver's home before police arrived.
Canadian police said in a press conference on Wednesday that information received by the police included a "martyrdom video" provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation about the young man going to carry out the attack.
On the screen, a man wearing a black barracuda hat was reading the Qur’an, referring to crimes against Muslims, and vowing to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon.
In the video, he said the attack would take place within 72 hours, and at peak times.
This is the first time since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year that police killed terror suspects before the incident.
After the upgrading of the renovation of the Beijing Hangzhou Canal Branch Line, the Old Vancouver River and the North Grand Shipyard will be charged a fee from September 1st.
The two branches of the shipyard have been rebuilt by social financing, and the charges have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Van Fu River navigation route flows through the gold countryside and fish basin, and enters the main navigation route of the Chinese Grand Canal through the South Yang Lake, with a total length of 32.5 kilometers.
According to the navigation needs, the Old Fukushima waterway adopted the method of conservation and transformation, the local water depth was deepened, the local sudden bends were curved and straighted, and navigation conditions were improved.
The route passes through the county and city district, and enters the main route of the Chinese Grand Canal through the Nanjing Lake, with a total length of 19 km.
The renovation of the two lanes began in February 2011 and completed the acceptance of construction in January 2015, with investment in the construction and operation of Jining City's Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, fee repayment", the Jinan City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center charges the routes passing fees according to the fee criteria approved by the Shandong Provincial Pricing Bureau.
Among them, the basic pass fee is calculated at 1.75 yuan / loaded ton, and the mileage pass fee is calculated at 0.05 yuan / km loaded ton.
The time limit for charging the pass fee is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
Reporters from the Jining City Port Aviation Administration learned that at present there are four charged routes in Jining territory, respectively, the Shandong River Route, the White Horse River Route, the North Grand Slide Route, and the Old Wanzhou River Route.
The four shipping routes, which are the branch routes of the Beijing Hangzhou Canal, are all upgraded in the form of social financing.
The upgrading and transformation project of the Shandong River Railway is the first to adopt the "government + market" model for projects in Shandong Province's Inner River Port Aviation infrastructure construction, the government accounts for the main investment, and social funds complement the funding gap.
The branches of the White Horse River, the Old Wanzhou River, and the North Grand Ski River take the purely market-oriented way of operation.
The funds allocated by the state finance cannot meet the needs of engineering construction and restrict the progress of navigation upgrading.
Social funding for the construction of public infrastructure is in line with the requirements of national policy and is also a way to break the bottleneck of funding.
Ning Zhao's performance in the 100 meters free swimming semi-final has left many Chinese spectators speechless.
But in the 50 meters free swimming preview, Ningzhou once again refreshed the people's "bottom line".
In fact, 50 meters of free swimming is not the main topic of Ningxiao, his performance and best results in the Kazan World Championship, also determined that he was not likely to make a breakthrough in this project.
Indeed, Hong Kong's authoritative media "Great Communique" revealed that the biggest reason for Ningzhou's loss was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors outside the pitch may have had a big impact on his ideas about the future, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment world.
After the tournament in Kazan, Ninjago became red instantly due to its super high color value and good results.
So, “National husband”, “small fresh meat”, “blonde man” and so on became the label on his body.
Various business activities to find the door, good money way, become a golden lighting avenue.
In this case, even choosing to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle was not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible path.
After all, he was only 23 years old, and after a certain study, he was completely able to appear in one or two TV shows with his popularity.
But do you need to see if you have enough qualifications compared to those of your predecessors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Liu Xiaobo, 21 years old, has reached the end of his athlete's career.
Liu's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered, and also laid the foundation for her future entry into the entertainment sector.
After his retirement, Liu has appeared in several television series and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tadeo participated in two double-person ten-meter competitions at the Olympics and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But after losing to his teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic single-person ten-meter competition, Tadeo's competitive condition declined and was fired by the jumping water team.
And he and his daughter participated in "Where Daddy Goes" and other broadcasts, which made him earn a lot of eyes.
The former gymnastics gold generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaoping and Chen One Ice all participated in various broadcast programs.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiaoping led China at the time to win the 2008 Olympic Men's League championship, and Yang Wei also won the personal all-powered gold medal twice, known as the all-powered king.
At the same time, Chen Ike led China to win the 2012 Olympic group championship, he also became the king of the ring.
And after the mistake of losing the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen's large-scale move also left him countless.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the pitch at the moment, and for the show, it’s just like a little bit of water – touch and go.
But whether retired or active athletes, being able to get the favour of the entertainment sector needs to have successful achievements to guarantee.
After all, the athlete enters a new field, whether in capacity or humanity, is an empty state.
Even the "old" of the entertainment industry for many years, such as Tanja and Liu Xiaobo, the average audience mentions them, and more still think of their performance at the Olympics.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaoping and other newcomers, introduced at the show, without exception, are "Olympic champions".
Compared to several of the above, the name of a swimming world champion is still slightly thin.
Moreover, compared with the performance of Tadeo, Liu Xiaobo, Yang Wei and others, the negative impact on his image is probably also invaluable if Ning Zhao was 23 years old and his sporting career suffered a bit of frustration.
After all, referring to athletes, people's demands are "not asking for a hundred battles, but asking for no fear of difficulty", and the distance is much less.
Return ten thousand steps said, Ningzhou grows fine, can completely rely on the value of the color to obtain the support of thousands of brain remnants.
No effort, only on the appearance, want to mix well in the entertainment sector, this is not more difficult than training to find the appropriate state.
The choice of the path of life depends entirely on the personal will, but how to choose, there should be a number in the mind.
On the surface, online social platforms expand the circle of communication and reduce people's feelings of loneliness.
The scope of social networking is increasingly widespread, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone communication, but even penetrating into the real life circle of offline, quietly changing the social life of the current people.
The benefits of socializing online are obvious, such as easy-to-speed, so they are favored by young people.
A survey of college students’ social habits showed that 57 percent of college students spend more than five hours a day on their phones and are basically “free of opportunity” in their daily lives.
“Social networks have the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission, multi-person communication at the same time, and meet the needs of contemporary college students.”
Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we are becoming more and more loving online conversations.
Newcomers in the company love to communicate with colleagues online, "because everyone is not very familiar with the unit, through social platforms, the relationship is much closer than before."
Love dating is also commonly used online communication, "before with friends because of some mistakes for a period of time did not contact, then in a large group first to talk a few words again."
IT engineer Wu is a deep networking social enthusiast, and most of his social life takes place online, with networking contacts many times more than the number of offline friends.
Wu said that he was “more like fish in the water” on the Internet.
"You can answer friends when you want to, because there is a lot of time to consider words, and the expression can be clearer."
“Hidden under the ID you came to me to avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions, not only have room to spin, even give each other more thought time and space.”
“People with different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace.”
However, Wu's friend, Xiao Peng, felt that Wu's life was a "very boring houseman."
Xiaoping and Wu were acquainted in a large crowd, because they were both active speakers, and soon became acquainted.
Xiaoping felt that Wu and the online judgment of two people, the word is boring, and does not take the initiative to express opinions, turning back and forth is a few sentences "Oh, okay, yes?", or "this I want to check out the internet."
Yellowwater police have now intervened in the investigation, and the Yellowwater transportation department will also intensify the repair of illegal operating vehicles.

The reporter of the South China Sea Network learned from the public security bureau of the Yongqing Autonomous County that the police have currently accepted the reports of these two cases, and the cause of the two cases, who is responsible for them, and whether they are related, are under further investigation.
Wang Wengyi, head of traffic management station of the LNG Transportation Bureau, said that the LNG Transportation department began repairing the illegal passenger transportation three wheels at the beginning of this year and banned a total of 613 illegal passenger transportation three wheels.
In the next step, the transportation department will apply to the county government, and jointly multi-departments will intensify the repair of illegal operating vehicles such as three wheels, motorcycles and black cars in the county.
At 8 a.m. on August 11, Zirou's evening newspaper reporter followed the "Healthy China" advisory service team to the West Lake Town River Cove village in the East Port area.
The village is remote, about 24 kilometers from the city district, with more than 200 inhabitants, causing difficulties for many middle-aged patients to go to the hospital due to economic, traffic and physical constraints.

At the end of the ceremony, the participants visited the Memorial of Shandong's hard-working entrepreneurship and experienced the construction of unaccessible facilities.
At the teacher training site, the mayor of Rivas, Verfredo Lopez, said Nicaragua’s government agencies are working together to promote environmental management programmes and tree planting activities with HKND Group.
As a channel project developer, HKND Group has always followed international best practices to build canals in accordance with international standards to maximize the protection of Nicaragua’s ecological environment.”
By combining theory and practice, college students lead primary and secondary students to plant trees together and educate the next generation of Nicaragua on how to green the environment.
Francesco Reyes, a professor at the Department of Natural Resources and Environment at Nicaragua National Agricultural University, has participated in the forestry education program.

In addition, the report also noted that in the question of economic development and inflation in Thailand in 2016, there is a certain output from the forecasts of the government and some major international financial institutions.
According to the forecast of the Tower Department of Trade and Economic Development, the economy of the country will grow by 7% in 2016, while the country's inflation is also basically above this level.
The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have given different forecasts for the country’s economic development and inflation in 2016.
For these two indicators, the Asian Development Bank forecasts were 4.2% and 7%, the World Bank forecasts were 4.8% and 7.5%, and the International Monetary Fund forecasts were 3.4% and 8.2%.
Despite the impact of a series of adverse external factors such as the international economic downturn, the devaluation of the Russian ruble and the decline of foreign exchange, the economy of the country in 2015 still achieved 6% growth.
On August 11, when a reporter's telephone interview had returned to Huang Ilin in the house of Sichuan, she said: "At that time the situation was too urgent, I had only one thought in my heart is to save people!"
Huang Ilin is a student of the 2015 grade of Central South Linko Great Landscape Gardens Academy.
Huang Ilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan to study local architectural design, so a family went to travel.
At about 10 a.m. on August 8, Huang Ilin's father rested at the hotel, and the mother and daughter went out to prepare for a tour of the ancient city.
Just walked not far, and suddenly saw a group of people screaming, out of curiosity went up.
The eyes watched "the little boy has disappeared, the little girl in the water hard-working, on the river face only revealed her little head, sometimes to sink", when a child learned to swim Yuan Yilin hastily hurried to jump down to save people.
After the water, the 165 cm tall Yulin found it could not step down the bottom!
Before it looked calm on the surface, but underneath it was rushing!
But she still swam to the little girl regardless of everything.
Huang Yilin said that the river was chaotic and hasty, less than 5 meters away, almost wasted all of her strength.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the river pond, "The slope is especially smooth, I fear I have no strength to sink."
So, Yuan Yilin asked her mother for help, heard her daughter's cry for help, and Ms. Yun prepared to go to the water and be stopped by the tourists next to her.
On August 10, after the story of Zhou Yilin jumping down the river, Ms. Yin received a lot of friends' condolences and compliments, but also received a lot of friends' "responsibility".
To be honest, when the child is fast on the river pond and can not go down and ask for help to me, my heart is fast broken.”
Ms. Yong said with heartbreak that, despite the danger, if she was put in such a scene again, she would still support her daughter's choice, and she was proud of her daughter!
Because of being forced, Huang Ilin rarely took the initiative to go back to the water after learning to swim, "I didn't think this skill was really in use."
According to Chen Yoyuan, the leader of the Yan Ilin class, Yan Ilin is a "learned master" recognized by Banri, and is happy to help.

The bulk of fraudulent text messages reaches a certain number, even if the fraud is not successful, it can be fraudulent crime.
The judgment of the people's court in the Nanyang City of Hangzhou Province determined that from September 30 to October 4, 2015, the defendant Li Wang sent fraudulent information in Kyiv Prefecture and Nanyang City District using fake base station equipment.

The northeastern tiger is currently listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Administration, data from the joint surveillance of China-US-Russia and other countries in 1998 showed that Jilin province has only 4 to 6 wild northeastern tigers and 3 to 5 northeastern leopards.
According to Jilin Province Forestry Department Protection Department of Long Spring, in recent years Jilin Province has been increasing the protection of wildlife, the number of populations of northeastern tigers and northeastern leopards in China is growing significantly, and the distribution area is constantly expanding.
The latest monitoring data in 2015 showed that 27 wild northeastern tigers and 42 northeastern leopards were monitored in Jilin province alone.
As the world's flagship wildlife conservation species in the border region of China-Russia, the cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance for the restoration and reproduction of wild northeastern tigers and leopards.
According to the Ministry of Forestry of Jilin Province, Jilin Province has established a long-term and stable cooperation exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 China-Russia International Forum for the Conservation of Tiger Leopards, China-Russia forestry departments and animal protection organizations once again reached a number of consensus.
The Ministry of Forestry of Jilin Province said that strengthening China-Russia tiger and leopard protection cooperation is not only a very urgent task facing China's northeastern tiger and leopard protection, but also the urgent task ofining the health of the Russian tiger and leopard populations.
Sun Fu firmly served as a Party member leading cadres, lost ideals and beliefs, seriously violated the party's discipline, and after the 18th National Congress of the Party still did not converge, did not take hands, the wind violated discipline, bad nature, and serious circumstances.
After this case occurred, after several media reports, it became the focus case, and the social impact was extremely bad.
After the case occurred, the leadership of the criminal police branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau of Haiti attached great importance to it, and immediately organized a large group of skilled police forces to actively launch the investigation.
The police immediately executed the suspect's online escape, took various measures to control it, and consulted the King's country by contacting the local police.
Because the suspect is a robber, repeatedly tackled by the public security organs, has strong anti-detection capabilities, coupled with his long-term use of drugs, interrogation into addiction often occurs, and interrogation work is very difficult.
Greenland shark, also known as small-headed sleeping sharks, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland, and reaches a height of 4 to 5 meters at adulthood.
But their growth is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm in length per year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an extremely long life span.
Traditional chronological methods typically use animal calcified tissue, which can be used in some sharks, but this calcified tissue is rare in Greenland sharks.
A new study led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark used crystals of the eye of Greenland sharks for radiocarbon chronology.
This method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time that it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the life expectancy of the largest shark was estimated at 392 years, and the error was 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old, and the maximum is likely to be 512 years old.
In addition, female Greenland sharks are said to have reached sexual maturity by about 4 meters in height, in exchange for age, which is at least 156 years old.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that Greenland sharks are the longest known and longest-lived vertebrates on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champion, the red whale (211 years old).
Over the past year, the conversion results have been remarkable, the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, but also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the market performance point of view, in the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of the RMB exchange rate are obvious, the flexibility of the exchange rate is enhanced, and the exchange rate is expected to be overall stable.
Currently, the upward and downward fluctuations of the RMB against the USD average exceed 100 points have repeatedly occurred, but the process has altered.
The last exchange measure before last year's "8·11" exchange was implemented in 2005, with the RMB significantly increased against the US dollar over the decade.
Since the implementation of the new exchange rate, the RMB has changed its previous appreciation status, and the average exchange rate of the RMB decreased by about 8% over the year.
On October 1, this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the RMB and become the SDR (special withdrawal right) weighted currency.
This week, statistics released by the General Administration of Customs of China showed that in the first seven months of this year, China's gross import and export value was 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, China's gross import and export value fell only 0.9 percent, especially its exports grew 2.9 percent.
Experts believe that despite signs of stability in imports and exports in July, there should not be too high expectations.
In July, China's gross import and export value was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9% compared to the same year.
Among them, exports of RMB 1.22 trillion, an increase of 2.9%; imports of RMB 873 trillion, a decline of 5.7%; trade surplus of RMB 342 trillion, an expansion of 34%.
Despite the continued decline in gross import and export ratio, the export data grew, the fifth consecutive month since March.
Shanghai police for 4 months stole more than 3,400 people to strike 157 gangs of "theft theft"
At the same time as the investigation of the case, the police also seized more than 33 million yuan of robberies.
According to the confession of members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from the outside through the black car, then departed from the car separately, and after a few hours they met together in the car, and left again together.
During the course of the crime, the suspects often use a building as a unit, use an outer wall to climb and break the anti-theft window fence from top to bottom.
Recently, the suspect in the case has been transferred by the Xi Jinping Public Security Branch to the Xi Jinping District Procuratorate to review the prosecution.
The police reminded the majority of the citizens, when going out, it is necessary to lock the door and door windows, and for the choice of anti-theft windows, it is suggested that the citizens should choose the hardest steel material.
According to China Voice's "News Night Summit", Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Kenya in late August to attend the sixth African Development Conference.
The Africa Development Conference is led by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so this will be the first time the conference will be transferred to Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said that meeting locally in Africa would help to attract attention from African and European countries to Japan.
In order to cooperate with Abe's visit, the Japanese People's Party will send delegations to relevant countries.
Japan’s path to “common habit” began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference, initiated by Japan, also began in 1993, which is no coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important box office of the United Nations, and why would Japan want to abandon Africa?
It will also exchange views with stakeholders on the response to the extremist group “Islamic State” and terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japan's Foreign Minister Shaytada文雄 also recently expressed his intentions at the UN Security Council on the African Development Conference.
In the meantime, Abe announced that in order to stabilize the sub-Saharan African countries, he will provide assistance of 100 billion yen (about RMB 6.1 billion) in five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity towards Africa has been primarily aimed at two purposes: one is to increase Japan's presence in Africa; and the other is to gain support from African countries on the issue of the normalization.
The Japanese issue expert Yang Berjiang analyzed that "from the political side, despite the relatively backward development of Africa, but the number of countries is relatively large, so Japan has always seen it as the so-called 'big ticket field'. "
In the future, Japan will not give up, and the work for Africa will not end there, and it will continue to strengthen.
Economically, because Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the current context of young people's ageing, domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from 10 years ago, to 10 years later, Shinzo Abe, in which time, Japan has repeatedly launched the "spurgeon", but they are all gone.
The Japanese issue expert Yang Berjiang believes that Japan's intention to enter the usual is obvious, but the path to enter the usual is inevitably difficult.
In order to its goals, Japan must first and foremost develop good relations with its neighbors, in which Japan needs a correct attitude, whether in geopolitical competition or in national disputes and historical knowledge.
The Sea Coast Maritime Court filed a case to ensure the rights and interests of the parties to the sinking of high-altitude fishing vessels

Traditional customs to introduce new highlights "2016 Shandong Cultural Festival" Hong Kong Widong Opening
Drumming music, traditional snacks, gorgeous decorations, crowded scene.
Hosted by the General Assembly of Hong Kong Mountaineering Society, the "2016 Mountaineering Festival" will be held from 12 to 14 in Victoria Park, which is Hong Kong's largest mountaineering event.
In addition to the continuation of the already existing "rape race", there is also an additional "parent's basin to stack competition" for the whole family to participate.
Not only in the form of cartoons to introduce the history of the culture of Shandong, the scene also has Shandong themed 3D selfie areas, traditional dining areas and traditional craft flow classrooms, attracting many children and overseas people to experience the visit.
A couple from France stayed on the venue for 3 hours and had a great deal of experience in a mini-card mobile classroom.
“Seeking out this special festival online, so decided to look and feel very fresh.”
They said that although there are similar festivals in France to commemorate the ancestors, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, there is music, there is food to learn traditional crafts.
She said, “In such a busy financial metropolis in Hong Kong, you can see such a large-scale and organized ritual of ancestral worship.”
“This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand and pass on these traditional crafts.”
The president of the event, Zhou Feng Shui, said: "We don't want to put the festival so horrific that people don't dare to get close, especially children."
“We hope that through the activities and arrangements of youthfulness on the scene, young people will know that what is behind the festival culture is to express mercy and gratitude.”
He also said that this time a total of 24 teams participated in the "rape race", which not only includes community organizations, but also works with several schools to get students to participate.
It is understood that the Hong Kong Mountaineering Festival has been included in the "list of intangible cultural heritage at the national level" in 2011.

The audience followed the story of "White Snake" and the actors' lyrics, while smiling, and warm applause.
Marissa Himenis Cachoe, who had watched the Kyoto show 15 years ago, accompanied her daughter after the show.
“It was a wonderful performance, music, lights, and stage performances impressed me, ... I felt it was necessary for my daughter to learn about Chinese culture and the art of Kyoto.”
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the actors and young actresses.
“I didn’t think the Mexican audience was so enthusiastic, and I had some concerns about whether they could understand the story, but seeing them catch the story and a lot of laughter today was beyond my expectation.”
China's ambassador to Mexico, Wu Xiaoqi, said the various cultural exchanges and activities of this year's "Year of China-Latin cultural exchanges" have a positive role in promoting the people of China-Mexico to deepen understanding and enhance friendship.
Next year is the 45th anniversary of the establishment of China-Mexico relations, when more cultural exchanges will be held in both countries.
Liu Gui to Sia research "double repair, two cities" demands to improve the level of urban construction
On the morning of the 12th, Liu Genghis presided over a seminary to hear the report on the progress of the pilot work of "double repair" "double cities" in Sia and the opinions of various relevant departments.
Liu gave full affirmation to the phased achievements achieved in the pilot work and the good experiences and good practices created.
Liu Yi emphasized that Sia should seize the opportunity for historical development, take the "double-training" "double-city" pilot work as an important grasp, and give full play to the leading role of demonstration driving in the economic and social development of the province.
It is necessary to play a leading role in raising the level of international tourism island internationalization, from the point to the detail, to enrich international elements, to create international boutiques.
It is necessary to play a leading role in urban and rural integration and overall tourism, accelerate the construction of characteristic and scenic towns, integrate tourism elements into each project, and build every rural village and town in Asia as a tourist landscape area.
It is necessary to play a leading role in the "100 Day Action for Social Investment", promote a number of major projects and park construction, ensure the landing of high-quality projects, and implement the requirements of the major action.
The standing committee of the provincial committee, the secretary of the municipal committee of Sia, Zhang Qi, deputy provincial governor Wang Yuan, and the secretary-general of the provincial government, Lu Long, participated in the research seminars.
In 14 years of sporting career, Deng Xiaoping won 18 world championships, becoming the first person in the history of the Chinese Olympics to win four Olympic gold medals.
She has held the world's first place in the tennis ranking for eight consecutive years and is the world's longest ranked "world first" female athlete in the history of tennis.
On September 26, 2010, he served as Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Daily and General Manager of the People's Search Network Shares Company, and was appointed to the Chief Executive Officer.
Recently, she will jointly create the first innovation and entrepreneurial platform for the sports industry in China.
There is also such a group of star coaches in the Chinese body: they have won countless glories for the country in the era of athletes; after retirement, they have taught years of learning to the latter, and have cultivated the championship.
As the first Chinese men's gymnastics world champion, Huang Yuan Bin retired after choosing to pick up the whip.
From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, and then to the general coach, Huang Yuan Bin created a "Olympic gold team", and the leading team achieved the mythical achievement of 9 gold 1 silver 4 bronze at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tanja has continued to advertise, and in recent years has played important roles such as "Burrows" and "Rhinestones".
Many NBA players have proven their strength, but some progress and some decline.
Whether it’s because of age or time limitations, there are some players who have a decline in performance every season.
Of course, some “regression” may just be a shrinkage of data, and the strength of those players may not have fallen.
Even though Wade is still one of the best scoring defenders in the league, his performance in the Bulls shouldn’t be as hot as it should be.
He and Ronaldo have limited rear range, with the third-point average of home star Butler being only 32.8%, which makes their offensive next season very crowded.
Coming to Wind Town, the Lightning Man will surely give more ball power to Butler and Lundor, and he is likely to choose to play in regular games.
O'Connor's situation was more embarrassing, as the first choice of the 76ers last season, he had to compete for time and ball rights with Simons and Enfield in the new season.
This competition may not come soon, Simons will still need to adapt to the NBA field, and Enfield will recover completely from his injury as soon as possible, but whether O'Connor can have a place in the 76's ranks is a question.
Last season, O'Connor scored 32% from low-level attacks, a proportion higher than Coachins, Wuchevich and Brook Lopez, while his usage rate was also high in the league's top 40.
With Simmons already showing outstanding controller potential, Enfield also has a more suitable body for NBA games, O'Connor's position may be difficult to consolidate.
Thompson’s usage has been stable in the league’s top 20 over the past two seasons, and this is also his two best seasons in his career.
But the problem is that with the arrival of Durant, Thompson’s usage will inevitably drop, which will inevitably affect his play.
This impact will not only be an impact on the number of games played, but Tom’s holding attacks will definitely be greatly reduced next season, which in some ways will also reduce the adversary’s difficulty defending against him.
Durant's arrival will shrink the data of the Warriors players, but the worst of these shrinkage is probably Thompson.
But that doesn’t mean that Tom’s level has declined, it’s more like he’s made a sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his underground efficiency came to his highest in his career, but the chemical reaction between him and Aldridge also benefited the squad.
Duncan retired, Ginnobyl announced another year of war, and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end, being the youngest of the three, with not much oil in the tank of the French sports car.
After winning the third championship ring, only Jabal, Jordan, and Russellby James have won more regular MVPs, while Jordan is the only one who is more FMVP than James.
Oh yeah, James just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in 52 years to Cleveland.
James, who came to his career’s 14th season, needed better assurance to prepare for the post-season.
So in the regular game, James’s figures are likely to decline further, and he will put more burden on Owen, though he will still easily become the league’s top three player.
“It is necessary to develop the talents learned from the country in Russia.”
On the 12th, local time, the president of the Moscow Chinese-Chinese Federation, Huang Xiang, said excitedly when he saw a reporter from China News Network.
Not long ago, she participated in the domestic “Overseas Chinese Cultural Society Chinese Talent (Writing, Painting) Training Course” hosted by the Chinese State Council Foreign Affairs Office and hosted by the University of South China.
When I just attended the training class, I did not know where to write books, and after the training class, I was able to draw and write my own work.
After returning to Moscow, you must use the knowledge and skills learned to contribute to the dissemination and promotion of Chinese culture.
The secretary-general of the Russian-Chinese Cultural Promotion Association, Nan Yongwei, who also attended this training course, felt the same.
She said that she has made great progress with the help of the training class teachers, but also felt the importance of being a "Chinese culture overseas disseminator".
Yan Wei said that after his return to Russia, he intended to spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Russians who love Chinese culture.

England won silver medals in seven-person football, Fiji won gold.
In the seven-person football final on Thursday night, the English team failed to continue their previous outstanding performance in front of Fiji, beaten by Fiji with 43 to 7 at Rio de Janeiro Stadium.
The Fiji team won the gold medal for its relentless performance in ball control, robbery, evasion, coordination, running and strength, which is also the country's first Olympic medal in history.
The silver medal was also a small consolation for the defeated British team, the third silver medal the British delegation won that day. This achievement is enough to make the British football team proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in the first seven-person football match to enter the Olympics.
Earlier that day, the British team defeated South Africa 7–5, which may have affected their status in the final.
But anyway, the Fiji team now is enough to beat a spirit-filled 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one British will be wearing a gold medal, which may be a consolation for the British team, but it may not be.This British is Fiji head coach Ben Ryan from Wimbledon, who was the head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the English team to today’s achievements.
Eight years ago, under Ryan’s guidance, they failed to win the Adelaide International Seven-Man Soccer match.
They are just a step away from the championship.
Although they have suffered tremendous strikes, they have also made remarkable progress.
Fiji took the advantage at the start, leaving the English team out of hand.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like crashing into a row of buses on the go.When Ossi Corinniso rushed into the corner, the World Series Championship team was already ahead with a score of 5 to 0.
Only four minutes later, Jerry Tuwey scored again on the right wing.
12-0 The English team has hardly ever touched the ball.
Mitchell’s powerful blockade left the giant-type Lyon-Nicaragua without a third score, but it only delayed the speed of Fiji’s score.
At 7 minutes, Asha Waimaru touched the ground in the right corner. 17-0, the English team was sharpened.
Na Carava got another point, and the first half of the game ... has one minute left.
Then, Wattmo Ravovo broke the defense of the English team and reached the scoring line.
In the middle of the pause, the score was 29 to 0.
The Fijians were born to play seven-person football, while the English team was still the first.
The situation is so.
The British made a huge change in the second half and struck the Fijians in the whole four minutes, which was a good performance in the first half, but afterwards the Fijians played a great match, scored again by Joshua Tussauds.
Dan Norton created a chance to score for the British team, he touched the left corner and changed the score to 36-7, but the game has long been in the hands of the South China Sea island nation, with their fans singing out loud, waving flags, singing and dancing on the stage.
The excellent performance of the Fiji team has to be applauded quickly.
Mata Williams stopped the Fiji’s unimportant offensive at the last moment.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced together, and the defeated British team could only regret leaving.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20–5 in the semi-finals, while England defeated South Africa in a fierce semi-finals.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped South Africa take the lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with his excellent performance.
Later, Anthony's brother Marcus Watson secured the team's victory with a wonderful interception and eventually won the English team a silver medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Stinning, inspired by their cancer-affected coach, won a boat racing gold medal
Without exaggeration, this is the most touching gold medal.
Since the first scratch, Helen Graff and Heather Stinning have undergone 220 punitive lifting exercises, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa is even more remarkable.
Though only the two of them scratched, the voice of another on board — Coach Robin Williams — has been accompanied by them to hit the second consecutive women’s double winning Olympic gold medals, Britain’s first boat women’s team to reach this height.
They haveined 39 unbeaten records, with an absolute advantage.
What we’ve seen is the two talented athletes advancing elegantly on the water, but that’s not the whole of this victory.
There are a lot of volunteers behind each of the gold medals, and it is their continuous dedication that makes a difference, and the biggest help is that of a coach who discovered that he had cancer 30 months ago and didn’t know if he could live to see the day.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they had surgery for me.
Without surgery, the cancer cells spread throughout the body.
Then the situation will be much worse.
This will change your opinion a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 and the effects would be reduced to a minimum, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get my salary, so I have to recover quickly.
It is an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, and although they say a few steps are enough, I still walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet around the room.
This is the starting point of everything.
Boat racing itself is a journey, and this makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment of taking the money, they first thought of Williams.This morning, Williams talked a little bit more than usual, to overcome his anxiety.
Staling, who was the chief of the Royal Artillery team, would travel to Afghanistan, saying, “I’ve been in a bad mood this week, maybe a bit extreme, but this gold medal really means something extraordinary.”
It repeatedly tells me how important this is to me, and how hard I, Helen, and Robin have done.
That’s what Helen, Robin and I’ve been trying for for three years.
Without Robin, we’d be just an unnamed pupil, and I’m so grateful to him for being the best coach in the world.
I can’t find a better coach than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Stinning have failed in five years.
The punishment imposed on this combination is incomparable to their opponents.
Even in the final 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark were getting closer, Staling and Graff still had a lot of physical reserves.
It was surprising at the time.
Helen cried out, “Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm.”
Not being affected by the opponent is very important.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t expect to do anything amazing.
We didn’t think about today’s glory, we just thought about scratching every pit and winning the game, and we did it.
The pair took a year to decide their future.
Graff will marry TV explorer Steve Buckshare next month.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don’t want to say it’s my last game.
This will put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very nervous.
It has now been about 4 minutes.
She said, “I feel better.”

Snapchat’s “animation” effect accused of ironing Asians
Snapchat says the filter is inspired by animation, but some observers believe it carries racial color.
Snapchat’s 1.5 billion daily users can change reality and make people funny with its filter tool.
You can turn yourself into a spinach, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Liechtenstein.
These lenses have the effect of curl, bending characteristics, producing more than 30 million modified selfie photos every day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
The Snapchat lenses have been criticized for alleging that the app appeared to be black or beautiful with white skin.
So when the app offered some users a filter this week that could create sliding eyes, strange teeth, and facial effects, some critics called it a racial irony for the Asian “yellow race.”
They even argued that whether these recurring questions meant that the company had a bigger problem in diversity.
The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company’s explanation is that the filter is a tribute to the animated characters, not an irony to the Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the harmful stereotypes in reality.
Others are also firmly opposed to these animated images.
A Korean-American artist who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared said in an email that the filters were “at least unpleasant and uncomfortable.”
She also said: “It’s hard to distinguish between an extremely disgusting Asian irony and the effects of a filter.”
While not only yellow people were in the filter, yellow people were extremely degraded.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches the bottom line of these cultures.
From corporate boards to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been advocating diversity and inclusion.
A large group of young people on Snapchat may be very sensitive to racial diversity because they pay more attention to it than the older generation.
When a snapchat filter produced an insulting image of users, 25-year-old Zhukati (a voice translator) said in an interview Thursday: “Such things are harder to escape from people’s eyes than before.”
On Thursday, Ms. Xu, who served as a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she believes racial controversy reflects Snapchat’s lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company’s employees for being mostly white, with the leadership being all male and adding a tag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said, “Either their employees are not colorful people so they can make such a decision, or their employees have some colorful people but their positions can’t let them go.”
Other observers shared a complaint she did not respond to by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on employee diversity and said it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to work specifically to focus on people with lower internal percentages and to promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she would shut down her Snapchat account: “I want to know if they need more users like us to oppose this behavior.”
Congressional group says military officials have distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a group of congressional officials said U.S. Central Command officials had changed the intelligence report to describe the situation in the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimisticly than it actually is.
The mid-term report came from a special working group formed by the Republican Chairman of the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Assignment Committee on Defense, which said Central Command intelligence analysts had “widespread dissatisfaction” with senior analysts saying they were manipulating their assessment of the U.S. fight against Islamic State.
Centcom, located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report about the report, “intelligence, which has been reviewed by senior leaders of the Central Command, describes U.S. counter-terrorism operations more optimistically than the actual situation and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies.”
A Republican representative from California said: “The behavior of the Central Command is unacceptable.On the one hand, our fighters are suffering from war, and on the other hand, high-level policymakers are being misanalyzed.”
The issue of leadership in the Central Command has been extended to the highest levels of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing U.S. training of Iraqi troops.
While there is no certain evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration ordered changes to the reports, the analysts felt that they were under pressure from the leaders of the Central Command to force them to express more optimistic views on the threat of Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL), according to the report.
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and congressional testimony from the Central Command were much more optimistic than they actually were.”
For example, a central command official has publicly said that a major military operation could take Mosul back as early as April or May 2015.
Iraq’s second-largest city, Mosul, is still under Islamic State control.
Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement: “After months of investigation, the outcome is clear.”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior intelligence officials in the U.S. Central Command manipulated the intelligence products of the Command to hide the threat of the Islamic State in Iraq.
A special working group was set up after the Republicans learned from analysts that intelligence about Islamic State was manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more findings will be made after the report, released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defense has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, in line with some of the findings of the Republican Working Group.
In a statement, the representative of the Democratic Party leader of the Committee said that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command developed a too narrow process for assessing intelligence on Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces.
Mr. Xianda said the process “hindered the release of intelligence,” lowered analysts’ morals and was “unable to accept different opinions.”
But Mr. Xianda and the Democrats also said they did not find any evidence to show that the palace attempted to put pressure on analysts at the Central Command, so that their conclusions were in line with “a preconceived or political narrative.”
The Beast Daily on Tuesday the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times that the Pentagon’s chief prosecutor started an investigation after receiving complaints from some of the central commander’s analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Major Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report until the investigation was completed.
But he said: “Experts sometimes disagree about the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage healthy conversations on these important national security topics.”
The impact of the investigation has gone beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have been successful (as more and more defense officials claim).
But last year, these claims raised questions about how much President Obama could trust the Central Command’s assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of ISIS intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy of more than a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hooke wrote a study in which he noted that George W. Bush’s administration insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq despite opposition from numerous analysts and barely considered the situation since the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in the opposition campaign against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook's team concluded that the airstrikes on Islamic State refineries did not significantly cut the terrorist group's economic revenue as it built a temporary refinery to continue selling oil on the black market, which is vastly different from the announcement.
According to the Times Weekly report in September, the Central Command did not publish the findings.
After several lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about the over-optimistic assessment of the war, Commander of the Central Command, Lloyd Austin III, was heavily criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is now replaced by Joseph Votel in his position in the Central Command.
The United States won four consecutive wins in the women's hockey game and will win against Britain.
Katie Bam, who won the match 6-1 to defeat Japan, won the second place for the American women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the American team defeat the Indian team 3-0.
Five goals in two games could be a staggering four, but 27-year-old Bum said she didn’t know she’d performed so well.
She said, “I don’t know anything about it.”
I’m not the kind of person who remembers getting into a few balls.
What she knows is that the U.S. team has won four consecutive wins at the Olympics and will compete in the group's first group against the UK team that failed to beat the Japanese team 2–0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet in the first round of the last match on Saturday.
Both teams are in a quarter-final promotion, which will determine who will appear first in the group.
The team that gets the group first will avoid encountering a strong Dutch team and thus be able to go further.
In Saturday's game, the American team made a miracle with a stunning performance. To know at the Olympic Games in London four years ago, the American team set the bottom in 12 teams.
Barry was also in the team at the time.
Bum grew up in Brooklyn, Pennsylvania, and first picked up the hockey stick at the age of 3 (her twin sister was engaged in the sport at Drexler) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics due to failing to enter the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not seen well.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Panam became the head coach, and everything began to change.
“This is a cultural, mental and substantial change.”
We were not at the current level in London at the time.
We came across a complete transformation.
On Thursday night, Bamm kicked his head in the first half with a close-range reverse shot.
India hasn’t won this match yet, but the team has shown a stunning tenacity and has kept the score 1–0 until the close of the third half, when the boom broke out.
She took the ball along the left side of the pitch for a long run, then cut inside to the middle, shooting into the net, leading the US team 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth half.
U.S. opponent goalkeeper Jakey Bridges scored an opponent for the first time in this match, in the first three victories, each opponent scored a goal.
This time she played superbly.
Bambi is too.
Panam said: “We’re in a good state right now,” but how good it will be depends on the outcome of Saturday.
Food during the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, was sitting in the office for lunch.
As a gastronomist, President Roosevelt liked the foods of Fifth Avenue, such as gooseberry sauce and Maryland waterfish.
His menu that day was very simple: tomato sauce, devil’s eggs, potato butter and fruit pudding as a snack.
Jane Ziegman said: “It’s about sharing food with those who are suffering.”
Her husband Andrew Ko added, “This also reflects the way Americans eat.”
The couple who live in the Brooklyn Highlands are both food historians.
Mr. Cohen’s previous book, “Fried Meat”, was about American food, and Ms. Ziegman, in her book, “97 Fruity Gardens,” tells the story of the lives of poor neighborhoods’ tenants through food.
Their co-authored new book, The Great Dinner, will be published by Harper Publishing on Tuesday, a book about the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common insights on food, they met a reporter in the sandwich shop in Eisenberg, where the simple lunch bar in the Dundee district has been in operation since the economic crash in 1929.
Mr. Ziegman, 54, tossed a crème cheese and crushed an olive sandwich, while Mr. Ko, 57, tossed a turkey, potato mud and vegetable dish.
The reporter pointed to a rooster that the couple found suitable for discussing diets during the Great Depression.
Ms. Ziegman said, “Bread was very popular at the time.”
There was peanut bread, liver bread, and soybean bread.
They are all made from one raw material and one that can be poured into the raw material.
Imagine your dinner is peanut.
Mr. Co has a strange appearance.
He said, “They must be like lead in your stomach.”
During the years before the Great Depression, Americans were self-catering, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked meals for the male farm workers, and they had their breakfast, lunch, and dinner on pastries.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who delivered food to hungry Europeans.The Great Dinner documented how the country suddenly ceased to be a rich country.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife were writing the book: “At that time, food was the main topic that made Americans uncomfortable.”
Another unpleasant topic was the cold-acid new foods: “minus foods” like bread and salmon became the main dish, and salmon was “the best way to cook residues,” Ms Zigman said, because chefs could use the cream in the sauce to cover up the unpleasant ingredients.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the protagonist on the American table for years, has become a rare luxury.
Strangely, the big snack only considers calories, and nutrition is the first thing that is considered than taste or even basic cooking consciousness.
In the course of studying the book, including various recipes, Mrs. Ziegman made a baked onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, “This is not common at the dinner table.”
Mrs. Ziegman said, “That’s very strange too.”
Peanut oil and baked onions cannot be combined.
This is characteristic of many family meals.
Familial economists have influenced the country’s eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the chef of the Federal Bureau of Familial Economy from 1923 to 1943.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines that encourage women to “fine calculations” and dare to turn creamed Italian fries with bad foods like carrots into delicious foods.
The Great Dinner is a rich “historical taste.”
Especially playful is the government’s response to hungry people, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hoover “I can’t deal with others.”
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in his childhood, his diet was as refined as a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said: “He likes to eat European-style western foods, such as fish and corn sauce.”
He wears a evening dress and eats at a gold-colored restaurant.
He was clearly separated from the people.
Hadn’t his wife Eleanor encouraged him to set an example on diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As Ms. Roosevelt says in the book, the housekeepers she hired had no interest in taste, so “food in the White House was not only the hardest food in Washington, but also the worst food to cook.”
When the United States returned to formality, many of the cooking methods of the Great Depression were abandoned.
Ms. Ziegman said what remains is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Zigman’s mother’s eating habits, such as how she didn’t throw away food.
Mr. Ko said, “She’s very scared of wasting food.”
Ms. Ziegman recalled, “She actually made many children sick.”
For example, there has been a “Crime Bubble” incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Co brought a dessert they had prepared at home: this was the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Ms. Ziegman said: “This is called cream-fruit-fruit,” and added that the name of a new tide for an ordinary dish is “common tricks.”
There was no raw cream in this dessert, only peanut, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone has difficulty stirring into the deep sticky brown blur.
Surprisingly, the dessert smells good.
Mr. Koe ate the second and third tablespoons.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife, “It’s better to add a piece of crushed peanut.”
Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, while Saudi production reached a new high.
The report does not stop the markets from questioning the OPEC’s credibility, and the road to the oil price recovery may still be filled with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC rotating chairman and Qatar’s energy minister, Sadat, said OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that the production of the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, increased in July by 460,000 barrels per day to 33,11,000 barrels per day.
OPEC also said in the monthly newspaper that the low price of crude oil has prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, exacerbating the degree of market surplus supply.
Influenced by this news, coupled with the U.S. raising crude oil output forecasts and the unexpected increase in crude oil stocks, international oil prices fell for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's closing, the price of lightweight crude futures delivered on the New York Commodity Exchange in September fell 2.48 percent, and the price of London Brent crude futures delivered in October fell 2.7 percent.
Reuters believes that the proposed oil producer congress is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and the data released by the U.S. Energy Information Agency has also crushed market popularity.
Iranian official news agency Fars quoted Iran’s oil minister Zhang In on Wednesday as saying that Iran’s daily crude oil output was the highest at 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
Russia’s energy minister, Novak, said there was no need for a new round of negotiations at current oil prices.
The last meeting of oil producers was in April, and OPEC members failed to agree on any measures.
BMIResearch oil and gas analyst Emma Richards said markets and the media could overreact to the OPEC meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC is changing market sentiment by releasing signals that they will contribute to the deal.
This tool is like smoke and mirrors (which deliberately give a wrong impression) that trigger the eye.
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at the German Commercial Bank, said OPEC is unlikely to try to stabilize the market through its September meeting.
This is likely to further undermine the confidence of the markets in OPEC, after all, the organization has played a “wolf came.”
All over the world, illegal medical advertising, complaints reporting concentration, and medical institutions that have been repeatedly punished have been drawn as a focus.
The National Health and Life Planning Commission and the National Administration of Medicines and Drug Administration of China will organize and supervise the special supervision and inspection work in some provinces in due course.
According to the media disclosure, due to the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, the current product homologation problem is serious, the investment boom has declined, and capital has entered the expectation period.
According to data from the Hong Kong Elliebe Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of Internet medical companies have died in the year they started, and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical enterprises have disappeared.
However, at a time when most Internet healthcare companies struggle to finance in rounds A or B, several of the leading companies in the segment are still able to gain capital.
Apparently, Internet medical entrepreneurship must not be "a cottage", but to look at the market demand, soak up to specialize and do it deeply.
Fish Jump invested 1,200 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, 1,800 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical informatization, the electronic, integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
This cooperation with Qingdao is precisely aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management systems, and use this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has focused on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics from the outset, cultivating both pregnant mothers and doctors.
Pregnant mothers can not only free 24 hours and one-on-one consultation with the supervisory doctor, but also pay for directed consultation with the doctor.
On the physician side, iBaby breaks geographical constraints by taking the form of organizing specialists for grassroots doctors to conduct online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions, etc.
Currently, there are three departments on the doctor's side, namely for doctor's continuing education, doctor's social and doctor's assistance.
Provide content including online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social platforms with hospitals and doctors; legal assistance and entrepreneurial support needed for patient relationships or personal lives.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Li recently said Ali Health "is willing to sink down" to take health big data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism and cannot unification in the writing method on the same word.
Ali's current layout in the healthcare sector is divided into three, namely Ali Health, TianKat Pharmacy and Paypal Future Hospital.
Wang Li frankly said that healthcare and healthcare entrepreneurship will be harder than other industries, "it is not only a matter of how much money, but also to sink down, to withstand loneliness and slowly do it."
Watching the Olympics at night can damage the heart.
The Brazilian Olympic Games are running as well, even if the event is broadcast at midnight in the country, many citizens will watch at night.
In this regard, doctors especially reminded that overnight watching the competition has hidden health risks, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.
If you stay awake for a long time, the hormone will still be secreted in large quantities, the human body will continue to be in a state of tension and excitement, can not get normal recovery, can easily cause blood vessel contraction, high blood pressure, and thus cause cardiovascular disease.
Han Long especially reminded that there are groups with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipid, smoking habits, family history of cardiovascular risk factors, if you stay up at night, it will be more likely to trigger cardiovascular disease.
If you stay awake for a long time, not only the cardiovascular function is affected, but the gastrointestinal function, the immune system, the nervous and endocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of developing tumors will increase.
For older friends, Han Zhi Long advised not to stay overnight to watch the Olympics, especially for those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last "World Cup" football match, Wang has long been treated with a 60-year-old patient whose heart attack was triggered or associated with staying overnight watching the game.
Since this year, the department has received some patients with heart attacks or strokes around the age of 25, which is largely caused by the long-term lifestyles of patients.
Do not wake up every day, occasionally staying overnight to watch your favorite sports, other items may wait for the next day to watch the game replay.
At night, supplement water in a timely manner, eat more fruit, prevent blood vessel blockage, and strengthen the body's immunity.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union delivered missiles to Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war in the USSR.
The incident was considered the culmination of the Cold War and is known as the “Cuban Missile Crisis.”
But little is known that during the same period of the Cold War, a strong solar storm was less likely to cause the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, an event that was only first published by researchers on August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm severely disrupted the radar and radio communications of the U.S. military in the Arctic.
These radars were part of the U.S. ballistic missile early warning system used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel at the time involved in predicting and analyzing solar activities, and consulted non-confidential literature.
In the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the U.S. Air Force always had a portion of the aircraft carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the interference was caused by the Solar Storm and not by the Soviet Union, so he ordered that the aircraft be put in combat readiness.
Fortunately, the U.S. military’s solar activity and its research on Earth’s electromagnetic interference, which began in the late 1950s, eventually prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the U.S. Air Force Aviation Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the U.S. military has since seen space weather as an operational concern and has built a more powerful space weather forecast system.
Citizens in daily travel, find that the car is hindered by a strange vehicle, in the case of not contacting the driver of a strange vehicle, can use the "WeChat" function to solve this trouble.
On August 11, Xi'an Interpol WeChat service number " Xi'an Interpol" launched the "WeChat transporter" service.

This new service function is fast, saving administrative costs; second is to respect and protect the personal privacy of citizens; third is full-time, full-time service.
As long as the citizen has WeChat, it can be very convenient to operate on its own, this way can relatively make the transfer of both parties more friendly and easy to "meet", alleviate the problem of parking difficulties, and reduce the public security cases involved.
On the other hand, for owners who refuse to move the car, illegally park or hinder the passage, the Xi'an customs department said that the police will take different handling measures according to the actual situation and deal with them according to the circumstances.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new edition of the Guidelines for Defense Cooperation between the United States and Japan, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more aggressive role in the world.
It was on the same day that U.S. Defense Secretary Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Shimada文雄 and Japanese Defence Minister Zhou Yuan attended a news conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that the Chinese civil think tank publishes the Japanese military strength assessment report and the fourth time that the English version is launched.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including general policy adjustments, military strength, national defense budget, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
The report said 2015 was the year of the Abe government's gradual takeover of major policy adjustments in the field of security for several consecutive years.
Since then, Japan’s security initiatives will be mainly at the operational level of the application of the legal system, strategic implementation, and policy implementation, rather than large adjustments and changes in the framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasizes that Abe's cabinet attempted to make the above three breakthroughs to the multiple goals of promoting Japan's "normal nationalization", the self-defense force's intervention in international security affairs, the strengthening of the Japan-U.S. alliance, and the defense of China.
Previously, the China Strategic Culture Promotion Conference issued Japanese military strength assessment reports on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014 and June 30, 2015.
On August 12, the Financial Times released a collection of pictures of the official residence of the U.S. ambassador to China.
In contrast, the U.S. ambassador’s residence could look like a safe home in the next film adapted from the Cold War spy novel by John Locke.
The official residence is grey, and is tightly defended by the outer perimeter, the second floor inner wall, the striped wire grid and the vehicle barrier layer.
Lack of public sports facilities
The black coal-field warehouse, turned into a "green grass-like" football field; the red brick-top factory, turned into a modern sports hall.
On the People's Fitness Day, Hangzhou's South Lookout Camp Sports and Cultural Park outside the Jiangxi Gate unlocked a mysterious veil.
It used to be a coal farm, which remained untouched after closing more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and living garbage.
After the renovation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened to the outside in November, provide free sports venues to the citizens, and undoubtedly opened up a brand new land for all people's sports.
This reminds people of Hangzhou Chen Chongqing School, this Chinese swimming school "Hongqing Military School" floated several world champions.
The origin of the name of the swimming pool is constantly emerging, vividly interpreting the relationship between competitive sports and people's sports - a rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional athletes.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of people's sports, competitive sports in a sense depends on people's sports, and people's sports depends on the conditions of the venue.
According to the report, as of 2015, China's per capita sports venues are 150 times larger than when New China was founded, but are still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the "People's Fitness Plan (2016-2020)", which focuses on the development of mass sports.
To remedy this shortfall, on the one hand, relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the sports venues when planning the city.
On the other hand, public sports venues that have been built, including sports venues in schools and other units, should try to expand the scope of opening up to improve the efficiency of use as much as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which are currently ongoing, inspire people's sports enthusiasm and awaken everyone's participation consciousness.
Gillette gets lawyer fees in Merck's hepatitis C patent dispute
Under the ruling of a U.S. district judge, Gillette Science has the right to obtain lawyer fees arising in a patent lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company in the U.S. Merck Group for hepatitis C.
In June, after U.S. judges found that Merck had committed illegal acts, including false testimony and other immoral acts, Gillette was exempt from paying $200 million in compensation for violating Merck's two patents by Gillette's best-selling drugs Sophia and Havony.
In a lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bess Lamberson Freeman said Gillette would not have to bear the costs incurred by the defence.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead to dominate the market for the new generation of hepatitis C drugs. Gilead’s drugs can cure more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilded and Merck sued each other, both claiming to be the active ingredients in Gilded’s drugs — the owners of Sofi Bouwe’s lab work.
U.S.-backed troops announce they have taken back Manbij from Islamic State
A military spokesman said on Friday that all remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had left, and that U.S.-backed forces had full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border.
After the militants escaped into the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now scourging the city.
Sharon Darwish of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) military committee in Memphis told Reuters that they have rescued more than 2,000 civilians kidnapped by militants.
He told Reuters, “Mumbai is now all under our control, but we are still on the run.”
The Clinton couple earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton released her 2105-year tax returns on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clinton couple donated $1 million to charity, most of which was donated to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speeches amounted to $5.3 million, and the former Secretary of State earned $3 million from publishers Simon and Schuster for a book about her time in the State Department.
Clinton’s campaign partner, Virginia Senator Tim Cain and his wife Anne Holton, released their 10-year tax returns.
The two paid 20.3% federal tax in 2015.
Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Parmiers, said in a statement that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane will continue to be the milestones of financial transparency.
In contrast, Donald Trump has covered up false grounds and withdrawn his previous pledge to publish tax returns.
Although there is no legal requirement, it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers referred to the U.S. Tax Administration’s audit as an excuse for refusing to publish their tax returns.
Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Summers tweeted that you were in charge and attached a link to the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
Trump’s special legal adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audit was completed.
Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump’s refusal to publish his tax returns would raise questions about his net capital, charitable donations, business transactions and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the issue with fierce criticism and released a web video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to disclose his tax payments.
She raised the issue on Thursday in an economic policy speech in Michigan.
“For decades, he has refused to publish his tax returns like any other presidential candidate.”
According to Politics News Network, Trump hadn’t paid a single penny in taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday as saying it could still be the case today.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named it after billionaire investor Warren Buffett for a provision that guarantees that those earning more than $1 million annually pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway was headquartered, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also undergoing audits by the IRS, and that what Trump “fear” was not the tax authorities, but voters.
The first tax returns released by the Clinton campaign were in 2007.
The Clinton couple, who currently reside in New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax returns showed that unlike most Americans, their salary was only $100.
Their primary investment was a low-cost index joint venture fund, and the Clinton pair had dividends and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticize Berlin hotels for removing Israeli phone codes on “request” from Arab customers — Reuters News
A Jewish-born French filmmaker told the media that the Kabinski Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli telephone code, and that hotel staff said it was in accordance with the “requests” of Arab customers, which sparked a riot.
The author of the Jewish Massacre documentary, The Holocaust, Claude Landsmann expressed his disappointment with the Kebinsky Hotel, and published an open letter in the German Frankfurter Zeitung.
During his recent stay, Randzman wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes offered by the hotel.
But Israel is not in the list of countries where guests can call directly from the room.
Israel disappeared in the German capital Berlin in 2016.
Randy wrote.
Instead, guests can make phone calls to Israel via the Kebinsky Hotel’s call center.
To find an explanation, the filmmaker asked the front desk of the hotel.
Randzman said in the letter that the response he received on the front desk “was shocking.”
The hotel staff said it was “a deliberate decision made by the management of the Kebinsky Hotel.”
The reason for this was that the filmmaker was even more angry.
Randzman quoted the employee as saying: “Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel’s code.”
According to the South German Daily, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hades-Handelsmann, called the incident a “shameful disgrace.”
We were very surprised to learn about this incident.
This in itself is a huge disgrace.
What happened in Germany and the hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
This does not need any explanation.
“We hope the hotel can come to the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident has sparked heated debate on the Internet, and everyone considers it a scandal.
Some believe that the Kebinsky Hotel was simply “kneeling down” to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post directly referred to the hotel as “truly disgraceful” and pointed out that the street located on the famous Qudam Street was near a Jewish cathedral.
According to Mirror Weekly, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming that everything was “negligence” and “apologies” to Randzman.
The South German Daily quoted Kübinski as saying: “There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the list of fast dial numbers.”
The newspaper also said that the Israeli code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to deport Brazilian students protesting
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police during protests against the government’s public education system reform.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The incident was caused by law enforcement officials trying to disperse students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students attended the march, expressing their dissatisfaction with the programs.
To save money, the governor of São Paulo, Okmin, plans to shut down 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred.
Some students participating in the protest expressed dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temer through carvings on the wall.
Just days before a recent protest, protesters collectively walked out to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the National Senate.
Scottish cyclist Karm Skinner won the gold medal for his bike.
Scottish cyclist Karm Skinner last night at the Rio Cycling Field Men's Group Race helped the British three team successfully defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Howe, as the head of the team. When the young Skinner defeated the prestigious New Zealand team and returned, even the legendary cyclist was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team was stunned, and Howe won the fifth of his own six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth in the World Cycling Championship in London in March, and Howe has since retired.
The problem with the British team during the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics was to replace “first round expert” Jamie Staff.
The team did just that when Siddhartha appeared.
Howe’s retirement also left a void, and both Chen Imadi and Matt Clampton wanted to fill that void.
After seeing Skinner’s potential, the English men’s team insisted on getting him selected for the national team, and Skinner was ultimately out of sight.
Skinner’s partner was Siddhars and Kenny, who won the gold medal with Hoye four years ago. The three set an Olympic record in the qualifying, but this achievement was overtaken by the New Zealand team in the first round.
The three British cyclists eventually defeated their opponents and won gold medals.
Though Cinders was a little behind, Kenny took the lead for the team, and Skinner kept this leading advantage to the end.
The change of strategy was key to this reversal, and Cinders chose larger and thus slower spacecraft, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep up.
He watched the match as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny, and Cinders saw him as he climbed the podium.
Glasgow cyclist Skinner, 23, said: “It’s fascinating to me.”
I just do what I can to make my name known.
We set an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
This is so incredible.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics with Kenny and Howe, Cinders admitted to deliberately falling off the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew the comment, and the British team’s opponents could not appeal either.
This victory has no such problem.
Cinders said: “It’s like in London, the British flag is on the podium.”
We just teamed up three months ago.
We’ve lost a lot of world champions, so it’s too surprising to be able to defend the Olympic championship.
That’s just a race, a gold medal for the British team, which won seven of the ten-seat bicycle gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If that symbolizes the progress we’ve made in the last five months, then we’ll continue to be successful in the bike hall for the next five days.
According to Kenny’s status, it’s not impossible for him to reproduce Hoye’s feat of winning three gold medals at one Olympics.
If that were the case, Beethoven, who was 12 years younger and was also born on March 23 (this day seems to be a sacred day for British sports, and Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on that day), would have six gold and one silver medals.
This achievement is equal to Hoi.
Kenny will take part in the next three-day race that starts today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: “I will be focused on this match for a while.
Team games are always the best.
You can win a match with your teammates.
To be honest, one wins a little lonely.
Cinders said: “If he can win two more gold medals, then he should be awarded the jazz seal.”
It was the only match that produced medals that day, but the English team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owen Duell are the four-man four-mile group pursuits with the fastest results.
Their score was 351,943.
The world record for gold medal winners at the 2012 London Olympics was 351,659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will take place on the second day of the game today, and Wiggins will undoubtedly be the focus of the world’s attention.
Yesterday he had a quarrel with the competition officials before the qualifying, when the competition officials had him measure his height.
In the women’s group race that ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shand, Elinor Buck and Kate Archibald from Milwaukee advanced with a new world record of 413,260.
The British team relied on its strong field bicycle team to take the lead in the mid-term of the Olympics and pick up several medals.
After demonstrating its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cyclists were slightly disappointed on their trip to Rio.
A number of turbulences occurred during the period, including the resignation of April’s technical director Sean Saten for allegations of gender discrimination and harassment, and the retirement of legendary figures such as Hay and Victoria Pendelton.
But the first race night at the Bicycle Hall was enough to prove the legend that the British team will once again play at the peak of the key moment.
After the little life comes to this world, parents and fathers will be responsible for this life, which lies not only in the physical health of the child, but also in the spiritual development, that is, education.
If the child fails in education, even if the career succeeds, it cannot compensate for the shortages of life, the failures of the family.
When a new life arrives, new dads and moms need to spend time taking care of and educating the child and be responsible for him.
And responsibility, in addition to physical care, to keep them healthy, is also in the spiritual education, that is, to let children learn how to be people, how to grow up, how to succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to frequently accompany children, give children care, patient care, and also need to teach children to cultivate civilized speech and behavior, so that children can learn better knowledge and improve their intelligence.
The words of the parents will affect the growth of the child, they will imitate their parents, that is, people often say that the dragon, the phoenix, the son of the mouse will hit a hole, the parents what kind of children will be.
So parents in front of the child need to be a good example, regulate their words and actions, cultivate their own excellent character, which can indirectly help the child to shape a good mentality, make him better.
Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
Her character is outwardly vibrant, can communicate well with friends, and also good adaptability to the environment.
But Amy has a little secret in her mind: she can’t stay focused on what she’s studying and what she’s doing.
This secret has accompanied Amy for a long time.
Even through decentralized, modular time to study and work, she can basically complete tasks and score well.
But when the task is heavy and time tight, Amy feels very painful and tormented.
The individual's resistance to self-exposure and its emotional experiences is aimed at not threatening the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem.
Also, some behavioral psychologists view resistance as an individual’s disobedience to the correction of their behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to get her to calm down and feel that pain by breathing in a relaxing way.
And once she got out of that stuck situation, she felt relaxed and regained freedom.
63-year-old wanderer Han Mou has a quarrel with another wanderer Han Shou after drinking, then carrying a knife to kill him.

Law-abiding taxi drivers who belong to the bottom-line laborers, but want to compete with Uber, which is illegal but not restricted, feel deceived by the authorities.
Title: 2,000 chickens in Jiangsu farm sentenced by the court to seize the owner of the farm
After the judgment came into force, because Mr. Li did not automatically perform the obligations determined by the judgment, Mr. Wang applied to the Yuan court for enforcement.
On October 16, 2014, the Yuan court issued a civil ruling ruling that only 2,000 chickens from Li Mou's farm eggs were seized and could not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the seizure ruling, Mr. Li privately sold some of the egg chickens seized in the farm without the permission of the Yuan court.
By March 8, 2015, when the Qian County Public Security Bureau investigated, there were only 142 chickens left on the farm.
On August 12, the reporter was informed that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympic Games Organizing Committee issued an announcement stating that the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee inherited intellectual property rights such as the Beijing Winter Olympics Committee emblem and logo.
Without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, no one may use the Beijing Winter Olympics Association emblem or logo for commercial purposes.
The head of the National Development and Reform Commission's Industrial Coordination Division pointed out today that excess steel production capacity is a global problem.
China's capacity utilization rate in recent years is higher than the global average, but also higher than the US and European countries and regions.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to eliminate excess production capacity, and the results are gradually being shown.
He pointed out that the State Council attaches great importance to the global problem of overcapacity in steel.
All departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the State Council and seriously carry out the work, this year to reduce the production capacity of rough steel about 45 million tons.
From China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it has also taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The head stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially market behavior, it is the independent choice after importing country demand, consumer comprehensive consideration of product cost ratio and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the development of the global steel industry, but will only further impact the international trade order.
Speaking of debt, the head stressed that debt resolution is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of eliminating excess capacity.
Due to the large size of the assets of steel enterprises and the widespread involvement, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and if misused, it is possible to trigger regional risks.
In recent years, with the increased downward pressure of the economy, the overall demand of society has gradually weakened, the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined, and the production and operation difficulties of enterprises have increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to changes in the market environment, production and operation is difficult to follow up or even threaten to collapse, but is constrained by some institutional mechanism factors, withdrawal from the market more obstacles, become "zombie enterprises".
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resources utilization, increases the cost of social management, and hinders the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main cause of the losses is the same as the global steel industry is facing: low market demand and low capacity utilization.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and rule of law approaches, and the government mainly does the work of employees and social stability, ensuring a fair and fair market order.
The head stressed that the next step is to resolutely continue to grasp the de-capacity work and ensure the completion of the target task of solving the crude steel production capacity of 100 million to 1.5 million tons in five years.
On the afternoon of the 10th, the Chinese tourist police made their debut in the Red Square in Moscow and immediately attracted people's attention, Chinese tourists waved their hands with surprise and greeted local and foreign tourists.
On the same day, the first professional tourist police team in China – members of the tourist police branch of the Saia Municipal Public Security Bureau in Hainan Province – came to Moscow’s Red Square to exchange studies with local tourist police officers.
Moscow tourist police patrolled the Red Square, Nikolsky Walking Street, Gum Mall and other places in three groups, and the Chinese tourist police studied with the staff, and the entire process lasted more than an hour.
A 20-year-old police officer who speaks both English and Spanish just joined the tourist police last year.
He looked closely at the words of his Russian counterparts along the way and did not communicate with her from time to time.
When meeting Spanish tourists who came to consult, the Moscow tourist police interpreted each other patiently in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Ice.
“Moscow tourist police all speak foreign languages, some more than two, which is very touching to us.”
“As an international tourist island, Hainan is gradually attaining importance to attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our capacity to match the status of the international tourist island.”
On the same day, before studying with the staff, the Chinese tourist police also visited the Moscow city tourist police station to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
“I often deal with Chinese tourists and I’m very pleased to see them traveling to Russia.”
“The questions they usually ask are: how to go, where a monument is, how to rent it, and how to return to the hotel.”
Major Captain of the Moscow City Tourist Police Corps Lessakov said that in recent years the urban environment and tourist atmosphere in Moscow have become increasingly better and more attractive to foreign tourists.
To meet the needs of tourism development, in July 2014, a tourism police force was established to patrol, assist and evacuate tourists at major attractions.
At present, all of the Moscow tourist police are skilled in English, and some of them speak Spanish and German.
Police teams divided them into nine groups based on their foreign language levels, two lessons a week to learn self-defense tricks, laws and regulations, and foreign languages.
“There are two travel police officers now starting to learn Chinese, and we’ve spoken well, and we’re going to continue to improve their level of Chinese,” Lessakov said.
Lesakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourist Police has accumulated some experience since its establishment, hoping to inspire its colleagues.
He believes that the cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security of citizens traveling to the other country.
“Moscow tourist police recruitment, police models, equipment and good interaction with tourists have brought us a lot of inspiration,” Chen said.
According to the report, at least nine provinces such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing have issued rules for the implementation of residence permits.
Regarding the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the aforementioned regions generally put forward that they must live for more than six months, meet one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence, and continuous study.
The reporter noted that in terms of treatment provided by a residence permit, the "gold content" varies all over the country, and the scope of public services and conveniences provided in some areas has expanded compared with the provisions of the national version.
These areas have increased the facility for children to participate in local higher education examinations if they meet the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and other countries have made clear demands to gradually expand the scope of public services and facilities, and regularly publish them to the public.
For example, at least every three years, the scope of public services and facilities by holders of residence permits should be disclosed to the society.
The provisional regulations on residence permits stipulate that the public security organs who meet the conditions for obtaining a residence permit shall produce a residence permit issued within 15 days from the date of acceptance.
Regarding the deadline, most regions agree with the national version, that is to issue within 15 days.
Hebei made clear that for those who meet the conditions and materials of application, the public security station of the place of residence should issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.
Where the conditions for applying for a residence permit are met and the documentation is complete, the public security organs shall produce a residence permit issued within 5 working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the provisions of the provisional regulations on residence permits, the aforementioned areas clearly apply for a residence permit for the first time, exempt from the work fee for documents.
For example, Sichuan requires that public security agencies or community service agencies entrusted to strictly implement the approved fee items and fee standards, and resolutely prohibits excessive, ultra-standard charges or ride charges.
After inspection, on July 27, 2016, Chen Yang Xia, secretary of the Southern County Committee of the former Zhejiang Municipality, was to the provincial disciplinary committee to work, serving as director of the Party Style and Political Wind Supervision Room (vice-chief of the department, a trial period of one year).
The red wine for drinking that night was provided by Liu Jin personally, and the other costs were borne by Liu.
The disciplinary committee of Jiangxi Province notified that Chen Yang Xia and程子 Hyun and others were organized and accepted by private associations, violating the spirit of the eight provisions of the Central Committee and violating the party's discipline.
Pogba, who ate two yellow cards in the Italian Cup last season, will be automatically banned from one match according to the rules.
Although he has transferred back to the Premier League, the Premier League has always extended its cumulative ban to the Premier League field.
Thus, in the field match against Burnmouth on August 14, Bogba will be on the wall, and his return to Manchester United's premiere will be extended to the home game against Southampton on August 20.
As the first round of the 2014 No. 12 show, Sarrich will officially land in the NBA next season and join Philadelphia 76ers.
Saric is a young European player, many fans don’t know him very well, but through the Olympics, believing Saric’s performance has left a deep impression on people.
In the last match Croatia defeated Spain, Saric managed in the last minute to block off Paul-Gazol's attempt to drag the match into the offensive.
Recently, 76 team manager Brett-Brown has given a high rating to Sarri, who believes he has seen the shadow of Manu-Ginobelli when he was young.
Clearly, Saric has demonstrated his talent and made 76 people expect him.
In Croatia's first two games at the Olympics, Saric scored a total of 24 points, 17 basketball boards and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric demonstrated his ability to pull up space on the pitch, and after breaking up with his teammates, he was able to kick off the three-point line.
Although the 76-member inner line currently has a lot of talented young players, they don’t have any out-of-the-line capabilities.
From the hat to launching long-distance attacks and completing assists, there are countless in-line players who can do this on the NBA field today.
Since the start of the Olympic Games, Saric has received 13 points, 8 basketball boards and 5 assists in three games, which is quite comprehensive.
Since his decision to return to the Knights in the summer of 2014, James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts in a row.
As the current NBA employment agreement enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of negotiations as Vice-President of the NBA Staff Council.
Given the big rise in the league’s revenue, this is due to the new television broadcasting agreement, and the fight between owners and players about how to handle the money, the outside world fears that the NBA will fall into a shutdown next summer.
But for James, he doesn’t have to worry about becoming a freelancer next summer, as he has renewed a three-year contract with the Knights.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially starts, James is in the contract.
After the stunning iPhone SE debut, the mobile phone market has also met the tide of small screens.
Recently, Nubia also unveiled the first product of its Z11 series: the Nubia Z11mini.
Nubia Z11mini continues its consistent photographic excellence gene, with a more handy 5.0-inch screen and easy-to-use rear fingerprint recognition, achieving its outstanding user experience.
Nubia’s newly marketed Z11mini lowers the price of $200 from the original $1499 to $1299.
In terms of appearance, the nubia Z11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, which is still the classic "small red circle" design on the front.
The middle frame is made of metal material, with a symmetrical design at the bottom and a Type-C data interface configured.
The future of the Portland metallurgy plant is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of power supply contracts
As the power company that powered the factory revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract that would invalidate all supply contracts, the Portland aluminum mill in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the factory are currently facing an uncertain future.
The move came after the Victoria government decided not to continue granting subsidies to guarantee the operation of the factories.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
2,000 workers at the aluminum company’s Portland plant could face unemployment.
Once the factories close, up to 2,000 people could be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the plant’s electricity consumption accounts for about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity output, chain reactions are also likely to occur.
In 2014, U.S. Aluminum closed the Henley Horn milling plant, which resulted in the shutdown of the Anglese Island power plant last year.
Aluminum’s Portland metallurgy plant is currently losing and facing the risk of closure.
The move comes after factory forecasts for the next few years, initially due to the stronger Australian dollar, and most recently due to the price of factory products.
AGL supplies electricity to the large aluminum milling plant through the old Eyang power plant in Latrobe Valley.The company predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate their agreements.
The factory’s largest shareholder is a joint venture between the U.S. Aluminum Corporation and Oxide Aluminum Corporation, while China’s ZTE Group and Japan’s丸紅株式会社 also hold small shares.
The joint venture said: “AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, meaning that the mill will continue to generate electricity demand.”
AGL said the contracts were “healthy contracts” that should have been in force since November 2016.
Contracts have a termination period of 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
The power company said: “Therefore, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the 2017 fiscal year.”
Any impact on AGL’s possible revenue since the fiscal year 2018 is currently driven by the optimistic outlook of futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the company had depreciated the contract value of $1.8 billion in its “end-of-activity expectations.”
Aluminum said the decision to terminate these contracts “does not affect the ability of Aluminum to operate the mill or guarantee the power supply of the mill.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Old Eyang in 2010 that would have come into effect in November this year, but the company did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland mill in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle will close due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
Responding to analysts' comments earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Stephen Mickelson said that Portland's annual electricity consumption was about 600 megawatts, and the Tomago plant was about 900 megawatts.
If the two plants shut down, the demand in the electricity market would be drastically reduced.
“As an electricity company, this is not good news for us.”
Community Law Center Rejects 160,000 People Every Year
Every year, more than 160,000 vulnerable groups are denied funding by community law centers, which are now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people are denied free legal advice and agency services, most of them elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and those without resources to fight unjust deportation.
The shortage of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts.
From June next year, federal funding for these legal centers will be cut by another 30 percent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said thousands of people are rejected every year, according to the latest National Community Association Law Center survey.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change its existing decision.
He said: “The community law center in Queensland has long been underfunded, meaning thousands will not have access to the essential services they need.”
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who carry enormous debts that cannot be paid, those facing disintegrated families, those who are being oppressed, these people face legal problems, and the report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by another 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland MP George Brandies to immediately revoke these cuts in funding so that people can get the help they need when facing legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise the funding for legal aid to the national average.
The community law center and its corresponding community needs must now be addressed, and the Whitechurch government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team charged with firing staff
New York: Trump’s campaign team has been sued for failing to act after its Northern California Asian head fired a gun pointing to an employee while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state’s campaign team, described the incident in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodini said he had previously hoped the matter could be resolved internally, but after months of waiting he realized that "it could not happen."
According to Bodini’s description, the head, El Phillip, “raised a gun, placed the fingerprint of his right hand on the blaster, and directed the gun to Vincent’s knee.”
After complaining to the leadership of local and regional campaign teams, Bodini learned from the volumes that at least four others had experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in a complaint that “no shooting does not mean no injury.”
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, were elected and selected the judge she liked, the speech “who supported the Second Amendment,” i.e. gun-supporters and gun enthusiasts, could take action, provoked rage.
Trump’s campaign team said the media dismissed his words and he did not advocate violence.
In the complaint, Bodini demanded that the campaign team compensate for his inadequate oversight, and also demanded that Philip compensate for his attacks, beating and mental injury.
Trump spokesman Hop Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
Unable to contact Philip.
According to Charlotte's local news agency WCCB, Philip has recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not immediately respond to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign team is controversial.
Both sides in the case are Bodini and Trump Presidential Campaign, 16-CS-14300, the general court of the High Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must convey the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities, to London and to the nation as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, just as we did at the 2012 Olympics in London to ensure that our country and region could benefit from these events.
The Olympics greatly benefited Stratford and the Eastern Region.
And we will benefit the region once again by creating opportunities for local people and near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeship jobs, 40,000 new jobs, and help young people around the airport get rid of unemployment.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought Heathrow’s expansion was too big.
I’ve been told that Britain won’t be ready for the Olympics and that we’re going to be ashamed in front of the world.
The questioners’ suspicions about the 2012 Olympics are wrong, and their suspicions about the Heathrow project will also prove wrong.
While there are always obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem he faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not a minority.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate £211 billion in economic growth, leaving a wealth of technology and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have an outstanding Heathrow project team.The team has completed an infrastructure investment project of £11 billion on time and within the budget, including the T5 Terminal, which has been named the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and the T2 Terminal, located between the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to build a third runway with £16 billion of private investment.
Britain successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I am confident that the Heathrow airport expansion project will also be a huge success.
Now is a good time for us to convey the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow airport so that we can escort for our future and create a wealth of technology and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Board of Heathrow Airport and former British Treasury Business Advocate.
A woman committed suicide on a Swiss highway.
The victims lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman who attempted suicide was struck by several cars on the highway early Thursday morning and police are currently looking for witnesses.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morgi, Wau, early Thursday morning.
Police said a woman was lying "desperately" on the road late at night and was struck by several cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behavior was clearly committed with suicidal intent.
The woman died on the spot.
Police have revealed that several drivers involved have been investigated, but some drivers have not yet been confirmed.
Lawyer Giles Hofsteeter told the Geneva Forum that a criminal investigation has now begun, which is the usual process for such incidents.
It is not yet known whether the driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstadter said: “This will be determined by the prosecutor.”
Based on the outcome of two other similar cases over the past five years, drivers will not be held responsible.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by someone walking on the highway late at night.The final verdict was that drivers could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of killing a man by negligence, alleged in August 2014 that she struck and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Pajero.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking.
The judge said after the investigation that the female policeman's conduct at the time was entirely legal, and that the man appeared on the road "completely unexpected and unexpected," and that the female policeman called an ambulance after the incident.
Anyone who can provide information about the incident near Morgi on Thursday should call 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 to contact the police.
NASA climate model: Venus used to be habitable for humans
According to NASA’s new climate model predictions, Venus used to be suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Institute have developed a model that explores the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has high surface temperatures, no water and an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, has ever had an environment similar to Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus rotates slower because of its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may once have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and that it was rotating just as slowly at that time.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
There may be more dry areas on Venus than on Earth, but there has been enough water and geographic variation to foster life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the brightness of sunlight radiated on Venus was 30 percent darker than Earth.
Anthony del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Space Institute, explained at a news conference: “In a model simulation by the Goddard Space Institute, the slow rotation of Venus has made the daytime on its side last two months.”
This warms the surface and produces rainwater that can form thick clouds, which block much of the sun’s heat from the ground like an umbrella.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature on Venus is actually several degrees lower than Earth is now.
The Venus evolution simulated by the model is similar to what previous planetary scientists had speculated.
Although life may have existed on Venus, Venus has been exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet rays over the course of billions of years.
The oceans on the planet evaporate, and water vapor is also burned out by ultraviolet rays.
With the escape of hydrogen, only a thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse gas effect left to form the Venus we know today.
The researchers published the results of a simulation of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Communications.
Patrick Roy resigns as manager of Snowfall.
Patrick Roy, who resigned as head coach and vice president of Colorado snowball team on Thursday, said he had no voice at the decision-making level of the team.
Colorado executive vice president general manager Joe Saches confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement: “Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Colorado Crash with vitality, passion and determination.”
I’ve been thinking all summer about how to improve this team and give it the strength to the next level.
For this purpose, the goals of the head coach and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He also needs to have a voice in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
However, these conditions are not yet met.
Sachs hired Roy on 23 May 2013 and thanked him for his contribution to the team.
Sachis said: “Patrick told me today about his decision.”
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope he goes well in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Awards League's Best Coach in the first season of 2013-14.
He helped the club score 112 points and ranked first in the middle district, but Colorado was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the post-season game, losing arms with the post-season in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the snow crash team scored 39 victories and 39 drawings, ultimately losing the second out-of-the-line qualification in the Western League area with a 5 point difference.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy has won four Stanley Cups, two each when playing for the Montreal Canadians and the Snowballs.
North Sea oil field workers stop strike and continue negotiations
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil fields stopped the strike over wages, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
On the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell, there have been several strikes against oil field service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the current dispute settlement process.”
We will start earlier next week and hold several full-day meetings over the coming weeks to rethink these issues.
The trade union said its recent action was to protest a maximum of 30 percent wage cuts, the first in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced the remuneration of North Sea contractors by about 9 percent this year due to market pressure.
Prior to the salary cuts, the company cut off offshore contractors’ pay by 10 percent in 2014.
The company said another pay cuts would help the company overcome the market depression.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas facilities in 10 countries because of the need to streamline its operations after the merger with British Energy Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from falling crude prices and the UK’s decision to leave the EU in June.
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labor dispute in the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea is crucial for the regional economy.
In a statement, Dave said: “In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the majority, not the minority.”
In 2016, spending on new North Sea projects is expected to not exceed $1.4 billion, while the average spending over the past five years is about $7 billion.
Kepler measured the speed of rotation of the Aung Sanctuary star.
The Kepler Space Telescope’s latest mission helped astronomers collect the most complete speed of the Aung San Suu Kyi cluster of stars.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster have different rotation speeds and the association of rotation cycles with planet composition.
Lusa Reble, a research scientist at the Pasadena California Institute of Technology’s Infrared Process Analysis Center, said at a news conference: “We want to further understand the relationship between stars’ masses, age, and even their solar system history by comparing our findings with other star clusters.”
Aung San Suu Kyi is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 1.2 billion years ago and are just reaching adulthood.
They reached the highest speed in their lifetime.
At its highest rotational speed, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
When these stars wind through the star's magnetic field, they produce a braking effect on the star.
As the stars age, their rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the speed of each star’s rotation by tracking the time of appearance of recognizable star dwarfs (such as solar dwarfs).
The latest data set shows that larger massive stars rotate slower than smaller massive stars.
Rebell compared stars to dancers, and larger dancers rotated more slowly than smaller dancers.
“In Aung San Suu Kyi’s ballet performance, we found that stars with a slower rotation tend to be more massive, while stars with the fastest rotation tend to be the lightest.”
As the Aung San Suu Kyi cluster is relatively close, it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the mass and rotation of the stars.
Rable said: “The Aung San Suu Kyi cluster laid the foundation for the two-way rotating theoretical model of young and old stars.”
We still have a lot to know about how, when and why stars slow their rotation and “pick up their dance shoes.”
In three new papers, Rebel and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Aung San Suu Kyi's speed of rotation, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
Zheng Zheng, chief of the water management department of South Lake Park, introduced that the bottom of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep, without understanding the circumstances, waterers are likely to be in danger.
"Despite the fact that the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is still hoped that the vast number of cruising tourists can wear a lifeguard, do not violate the rules on the lake, and play safely," Zheng said.
The surrounding village has a unique marine environment, and has two major leisure tourism resources: natural ecology and human ecology.
"But the individual owners who bought the parking lot in the district, afraid that this would affect their parking lot rental price, and also suspect that other people have private minds, so they have been doing the damage behind, leading to the change of the parking lot."
The question of when the potato was introduced by whom, the academic community is still divided.
Among the currently more mainstream views, the introduction of potatoes mainly has three lines.
Of the three lines introduced by the potatoes, the most influential and most widely distributed is that Chen Zhenglong was introduced into Fukushima from the Philippines.
The Beijing Municipal Social Group Management Office will conduct special inspections on the use of unified receipts for social group contributions.
The inspection is divided into two types of unit self-examination and focus sampling.
According to the relevant person in charge of the municipal association office, the scope of this inspection includes social groups that receive uniform receipts for social group contributions in the municipal association from 2013 to 2015.
In its 2012 Olympic Communication Strategy, the Olympic Organizing Committee said: “The success of the Olympic Games is defined by the people who share stories on social media.”
From the report of this Olympic Games, the media in the way of dissemination, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects have changed significantly.
The International Olympic Committee and media practitioners from all over the world seem to have already faced this challenge.
On the 11th of August, the public sale of H shares entered the last day. It was that the market reaction was smooth two days before the bid. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the 18th of August.
A domestic securities analyst said that the oriental securities base in Hong Kong is not good, and the head of the company's business is the head of the securities company. Compared with China Bank International, China Securities and other bank branches, it appears to be inadequate.
Experts pointed out that since this year, with the return of the securities market, many securities business performance has declined, but the situation after the company's listing is more to look at the development of the company's own business, can not be summarized.
After the introduction of this regulatory new policy, Suzhou will become the first second-line city in the country to resume restricted purchases.
Second-tier cities that introduce or are about to introduce Taiwan City regulation policies include not only Suzhou, but also Chongqing, Nanjing and other cities.
