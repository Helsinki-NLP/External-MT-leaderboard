The right-wing populists triumph in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the anticipated parliamentary elections in Austria brought a sensitive weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered significant losses.
On the contrary, the EU Electoral Leader for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return on the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the country’s first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses almost nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major after-war parties; especially for the People's Party, which triggered early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Even early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advance over the SPÖ.
But the voters clearly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the party leader and current deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were made.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party’s leadership.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the way towards the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the great coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the socialists simultaneously expressed fear of a repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time, the FPÖ was still united, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated) on a common government, which even raised sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he planned the return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently put on this evolution.
The last party to have access to the parliament is the Greens, but these have slightly lost and fell back, among the Austrian political parties, from the third to the fifth place.
Evidently, no other party exceeds the four-percent limit and has accessed the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are at risk of cooling
If we could not solve the problem concerning the Czech researchers accused in India of illegal harvesting, it would follow, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
The minister said this today in New York after he met his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he observed after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, coming out of negotiations, that the executive power could hardly interfere in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed from the accusation and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
“The problem could be resolved,” the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could demand freedom under caution and wait for judgment in freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be graced," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "a competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided by India.
“We wish above all to maintain the best relations with India, which has a tradition that has been ongoing for many years.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he emphasized in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attributed great importance to the problem arising from the Czech entomologies.
“We see the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great disregard,” he said.
The minister escaped the question whether he had obtained from India the promise to take care of the case.
“I’ve already received quite a lot of promises,” he only notes.
A Czech Arbitrator Arbitrates the Struggle for the Sea Soil
It approaches a wall electronic map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
But he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent bottom of the sea.
This area is still as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the 30 members of the UN Division for the Affairs of the Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The harshness at work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The sea background hides a world unknown so far, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also unknown living organisms, which can contain the key to the development of a cancer medicine.
A foundation greater than the firm ground
The coastal states have begun nowadays to seamlessly aspirate to new submarine territories.
According to a United Nations Convention, they use their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often stretches several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
The latter may, according to the convention, claim exclusively to all resources of the continental shelf.
“To simplify, the part of the ground and its underground is considered a continental shelf, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred marine miles that represent that exclusive economic yone,” Mikulka explains.
The request that the country concerned submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous prospections and expensive metrics.
This is the result of several years of preparatory work.
“One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has addressed five applications, including those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only the last three countries mentioned have experienced success,” Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which is the first to considerably expand its submarine possessions, has recently experienced a global recession.
New Zealand, too, won the territory - the extent of the sea ground, which the Commission granted it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in prospects.
The profits they will get in the future of the exploitation of the sea floor will be, as they plan, invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, present their demand.
They can do so within ten years after they have ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the oceanic bottom, proclaimed by convention "common patriotic of mankind".
No country has an exclusive position anymore.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
“But let’s not be wrong, the seafood is not a Klondike,” said Mikulka, exaggerating that “these areas are just clearly defined and their regime is rooted in a contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
A portion of the marine soil is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the former Bloc of Eastern countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It obtained in 1991, under the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the one that is called a “pioneer investor.”
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and the Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the surface of former Czechoslovakia.
The background is moving there, it is a kind of submarine replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract from it on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposito rich in polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, brings an example of such a concretion.
She reminds a little potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to the legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the ground for the release of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready, but they never passed into action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defense, the German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
So, both the Federal Army specialists and GSG 9 officials, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as Technischen Hilfwerk logistics experts were on the place of release.
As the ministry spokesman on Monday evening, the German forces were not eventually required, the hostages having released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government had accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the site as a support force.
“Fortunately, this has not happened so far,” a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
Attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians and their eight Egyptian accompanyers.
After their kidnapping in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transbauted in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers has remained unclean until now, as well as the details of release or possible refund payments.
Those who were rescued arrived healthier and saved in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the kidnappers were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin, for the moment, no information was given about the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and special forces are expected to have landed on board an Airbus of the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first Chamber of Congress of the United States has failed a plan to save the heavy financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones is falling into the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan in favour of the government’s financial markets.
Despite all the calls by U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians to lead the two parties, the program that was supposed to justify the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded of this heavy $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, had called on the MPs for a favorable vote although the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened,” he admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent, which is 600 points.
The reason for this was the worries of investors that the state rescue plan could capture.
It returned shortly before the vote ended, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fall again.
Experts are now projecting new serious turbulences on the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval and the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of reservations for the next months, according to a study, the turnover has significantly increased compared to the previous year – for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the German travel thirst remains insatiable according to this study.
In terms of reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) told Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey by the GfK Institute of Market Research, increasing numbers of reservations already dominate in the autumn months.
So the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent more compared to 2007, the DRV trusted.
The sources of these results are GfK’s figures, which annually analyzes the reservation data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be registered there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the U.S. would be demanded, DRV said.
There, the increase in reservations would be approximately a third.
Besides this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our land would be destinations sought by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are highly demanded, DRV President Klaus Laepple explained.
Given the rising prices of energy and food, the costs would be here “more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized trip.”
Consumers can save money among other things with advance reservation discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been so well that an increase in sales will be recorded again compared to last year – although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertaken a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
First time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in pickets per liter and celebrity in Tyrol costumes of designer.
An event at the Beer Festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I do not have much in common.
She is a blonde, television animator and wears a custom-cutting tyrolical costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes at the beer party, and already the photographers throw on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that at my first visit to the beer party.
This is how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrol costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer party tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Theresia Square, everything is half worse.
Everyone or almost wears a tyrol costume or pants in leather; no one looks shaken or affected by shame - this is completely normal.
Only the sheet of my tyrolish costume gathers a few bizarre eyes at the stand of bananas-chocó.
A Bavarian woman makes me notice that I would have wrongly attached my board: "in the left means free, in the middle virgin, in the right married, in the back widow."
Discretely, I tripathe my circle from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she said and laughed.
Others don’t get so bad for these subtle flirt techniques and wear simple feuters, on which is written “Too drunk to get dressed!” and exposes us their naked back train without being invited.
The exhibitionist attitude young man is named Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it “gorgeous”, with a “ooooo” laying.
He told me all this after he relieved from the cup he had drank before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everyone thinks is a waste.
Bob is therefore one of those sadly famous "Wild Knights".
Others have no chance to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight in the evening, rescue bells run on the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Nurses intervene rather in mouth - always by four, they pull their cave covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we get back full of it.
Those who rest in the cave of the burned under the cave are not visible.
“These are those who can’t hunt anything anymore,” one of the rescue workers cries to me in response to my question and then disappears in the mixture.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident, in the city, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there later.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has been released, under guarantee.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was thinking of joining the European Union, European powers were looking forward to entering its backland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its falling imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least this is what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation tower in each of its angles, like some German provincial municipalities.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruin.
But once inside the woven ticket store, we have no more doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The railway station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retardating to the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that reaches Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land more known as Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregularities.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is a sabotage.
Since then, it slowly falls in ruin, immersed in the memes of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points, serve – at least symbolically – to emphasize the expansion of the diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed wagon towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10 and a half-hour trip, shocked on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital-presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots, represents an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built in stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and many bakery stores in which middle managers in costume-cravate- men and women- meet for morning affairs.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a center-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, cravate and he even has a Black Berry.
“The goal of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey was cut off from its backland.
Now she has to look to the east and west at the same time.
This was not the case of both.
She had to do both.
But now, at some point, “I asked if” Turkey shouldn’t choose?”
“Turkey,” he said, “will not have to choose between the two.”
He then emphasized an aspect that almost everyone with whom I was able to speak told me by heart: the Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, therefore, it is both a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey’s integration, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I thought again of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting for the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no more doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories by Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (dead on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already taking part in his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic youth chorus, Proteus.
The chorus was supposed to include those under the age of 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over the age of 20 refused to leave the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the chorus to manage any kind of music that was presented to him, whether it was madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young chorus was often impressive, always exciting, and that thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod repeated us of “lating music speak for itself.”
He would have said, “The composer knows what he wants.”
Everything is there, in music.
So you sing!”
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, accurate, even though never dictatorial nor appearing.
Regardless of the musical standard, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner says:
If a driver should be named Knight, it is Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have never disappointed me—and, sometimes, they have even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, “focused only on some people.”
It will miss many of us.
by William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology of William Woodruff (dead on September 25) states that "in 1946, he had restored his studies in economic history, in Oxford, and became in 1950, a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
This is what comes from Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at Faculty of Philosophy
“I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino ‘Flamenco and Life’ because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with a lot of respect.
An exhibition that transmits a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.
Next Next post: Honda’s Super Sales
In November, Honda will start the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor had already a good habitability, this new monovolum has an even broader interior space.
This is added to some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
This is an evolution in front of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz aesthetically features a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is innovative design, a new platform, greater dimensions and new engines.
However, before reviewing the new model, it is important to emphasize that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation’s launch.
First, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sale in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Just in Japan, a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years represents its second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
So, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales in the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
The head of the Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to palliate largely the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand’s managers hope to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% decline in sales.
Thanks to this rise in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to sell 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Containers and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of the next year, after its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five more centimeters), its width 1.69 meters (two more centimeters) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
However, the height does not change, or 1.5 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space as well.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the box – which has a double background system – can contain up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity compared to the box of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the Honda Jazz 1.2L’s box capacity is 379 liters.
The other innovation – in addition to the external elements such as the backlights or the panoramic roof – is the improvement of access to the back places.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz which opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre fuel propulsors.
Both engines have a i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases the engine’s drive.
The first 1.2 litre engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm of pair at 4,900 tr/min.
This propulsor - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propulsor, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The Bee Car to Avoid Collisions
To advance the development of accidents prevention technologies, Nissan has inspired itself, this time, from nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have built this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Research in Advanced Sciences and Technologies of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow the brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that resembles Nissan’s security shield.
But the most important is the composed eyes of the bee, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To re-create this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser range locator (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are on a distance of two meters and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“When it detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bees and immediately change direction by bifurcing its wheels of 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The greatest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
If that was the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Migration Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bees, the robot can not be turned up or down, nor in diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
“Every second this device must only process information and act according to these data.
It doesn’t need to keep the information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuver, that’s why it can work continuously with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we’re not talking about memory gigabytes or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new technology for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in serial cars in a decade according to Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid to be mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not missing genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking in mortgages at solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That’s to say ‘The Hotel of Bad Credits’ ... or stories.
The luxurious appearance of this accommodation and especially the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And especially where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
This is a game for teenagers.
What if the game is over?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It’s better than nothing, because it’s unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry to its table tower of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new welcomed by a sharp fall in its stock exchange rate.
A week after revealing a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total amount of $3 billion.
The selected price is 19% lower than the accounting value of securities by 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities providing it with a 10% return and a $31.25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, which is 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley stock, however, lost 6.79% to $23,07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which must allow him to diversify his activities but makes it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the past days: last Monday, Morgan simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, told Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought the participation would be entirely made up of ordinary actions.
But given the current situation in the economy and market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of approximately 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able in a year to convert half of its preferential securities into regular shares if these shares exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, or approximately $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he has "clearly" relieved his balance since the end of August.
The last weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock exchange rate falling by half as the insurance costs against a risk of failure on its debt were flying.
The cost dropped on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the merrill Lynch's acquisition, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refund the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third one to vote for a new Constitution.
The mission was accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" at the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the output of the voting offices and a count of a non-governmental organization announced a wide victory of the "yes", which was between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed dramatically," he said, congratulating the Equatorians at the headquarters of the Governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place quietly according to the Observatory Mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution dedicates the power of the state to the economy, reserving to it the “development planning” of a country living essentially from the oil extraction by foreign companies and the currencies that its immigrants send.
Leading by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives enhanced powers to the head of state, who will be able to perform up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and break a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of the free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty threshold.
It finally provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 prisoners released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the rabbits of the eleven tourists and their eight accompanyers captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanies detained for ten days in the desert were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived around 15:30 on board a special airplane to the Al-Maza military base, hosted at the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be examined there.
They are in "good health" and "no rescue has been paid" to the kidnappers," the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, said.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been balloted from one cache to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, the organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, delivered on board two helicopters, had launched the attack in the night just before the morning.
"A shooting exchange occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," said the official who called for anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces of the Lightning Unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret services, special forces,” he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle on board of which the kidnappers were, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and occupies the present electoral campaign.
So much better.
But a part of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the sums of misery that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or to national historical places that are hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that he neglect his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don’t have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government dedicates three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and that, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogies are concerned about exploring history, preserving with three undermons of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemetery.
When, a tribune for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states come to help the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in trouble following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, partially nationalizing it. The three countries support, at an amount of €11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution also possess interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the competition manager of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis within the framework of the international financial crisis that is expanding for more than a year, is for the Fortis bank.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s capital in each of the countries.
The bank will, without a doubt, sell part of its shares, among which, first of all, the activities, essentially insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a vertiginous fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to allow it to bankrupt.
Only on Friday, the company’s shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, the stock has fallen by more than two-thirds of its value.
Considering the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company’s leaders, is not realistic.
The company’s leadership accuses the uncertainty of the Outside Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of being the source of the Fortis stock fall.
On Monday, the bills have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution also sought private buyers, but has not yet received any proposal on the basis.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they won’t lose their money.
No panic was felt in the customer circle of the bank and no agency was taken by attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A Rabbit in the Chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about his medication purchases.
Information protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There are data protection programs that link the use of the information regarding the prescription of medicines, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s to trust his chicken to a wolf,” said Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions of drugs, to the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the capital insured in case of damage depend on the customer’s health status, and if they consider that the risk is too high, they don’t even guarantee it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after getting aware of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily provides himself with the pharmacies, the data about the person’s medication purchases in the last eighteen months. From this, the program determines himself, what disease the person suffers and what is his health.
For example, if this person regularly purchases high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to do to the insurer except the paperwork. However, small problems can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat burns, but they can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurance companies as an aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed in research and data analysis. They, they have to ask for authorization from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are bound by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their faults in the past.
Recently, some companies are also processing the results of laboratory analyses, and linking them to the data about the drug consumption.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use is getting more and more difficult.
There is a distinct law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the expansion of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in data provision is currently facing Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that’s why he has developed even further his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive consent of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and in the end, chickens depend on the kindness of the wolf.
The Global Menu of Marseille
The European Union and India multiply their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners for each other, this topic also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other issues, largely global.
Today, there will also be a summit between France and India where the main issue of cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be discussed.
The European Union acknowledges that India is a great emerging democratic power that should be given a broader right of speech in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet managed to reach an agreement on their support to New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They were not too late on this issue, yesterday, at this ninth summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Head of Diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they will double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the trade of goods has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be a too ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have harmonised from a legal point of view the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights.
India wishes to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the first trade partner of the EU, and, on the other, New Delhi, which is only on the ninth place among the EU partners.
The meeting focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need to hold a UN conference on this issue has been raised.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains loyal to the Energy and Climate Programme, including that it would like to reduce its emissions of toxic substances by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as with the fact that a global market should be passed at the climate conference scheduled for next year, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also want to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convocation of an international work meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian leader is on a visit to the French capital, where during a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, we hope that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement will last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 miles of titles in exhibition, and Turkey as an honorary guest.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Sheep: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
She will be followed by the press meeting in the Room Struktur, the Buchmesse's Butterfly 5.0: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the edition's position in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying into the desert of Nevada, was found.
The remains were found on a plateau at a height of 3,000 meters, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
But in the aircraft there is no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, eliminated the remaining doubts: "The plane was localized, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transport Safety Bureau (Ntsb) that a team of investigators sent to the site, a few hours after the detection of the accident, identified the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset landed from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a pull.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he was in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he had travelled the world by plane and without stops.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters of height, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect.
A 4x4 unusual of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the last born of the “compacts” off-road of the Star House, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Just because of its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on October 17.
Thus, the advertising beat that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unpublished way of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan’s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, you will have the impression that when you look at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elimina8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to raise the interest of future buyers?
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is shy now? They are part of the group" Ultras Italy" which has followed the Italian national team for years, and which, so far, has never created big problems.
He has never been confronted with the opponents.
The group extraction is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (in reality) of Campania and the Pouilles were added.
They had three-colored flags on which their town of origin appeared: Saturday evening, they were all kidnapped so that they were not identified.
They are inspired by the English Tifosery.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhosery of true Nazis, the Levsky.
Figc had made available to the Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact all controlled them: among those who went to Sofia, no one had a Daspo running, no one had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had stadium crime history, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then will take measures: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders clean a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits visiting Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand on the stadium.
Fortunately .
But now it’s time for fear-emulation: that’s that others are at risk of adding to the first hundred and fifty.
"We have to turn off this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves so," the Viminal said.
So, " keep the eyes well open especially for the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Pouilles there is actually a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet, Tuesday the Casms which can even rely on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which take care of the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce chorus, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hymn? in Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste where it is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
“I’m not a sociologist – adds No. 1 of the Observatory – crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the sifflets toward Mameli’s hymn: those there too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polish.”
