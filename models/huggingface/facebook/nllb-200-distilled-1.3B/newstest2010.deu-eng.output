Barack Obama becomes the fourth U.S. president to win the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to accept the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he will receive the diploma, medal and a check for $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The couple will then meet with King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates in the ceremony where Obama receives the prestigious award.
He is the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive it while in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be speaking about the war in Afghanistan when he receives the award.
The president doesn't want to shy away from this topic because he knows he's accepting the award as a president who's currently at war with two countries.
The war effort has been intensified by the fact that a few days ago he sent more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but he has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The programme will include a banquet with the President and his wife, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway.
Obama was very reserved about the price from the beginning.
He stated, for example, that he felt that he did not quite deserve the prize.
He also repeated that the prize was not for him alone but for all those who share his values.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this was a "call to action".
Conservationist Accused of Blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturenschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases last year, he lodged appeals against some construction proceedings, asking investors to withdraw his appeals in his favour, said Alena Romova, a police spokeswoman in Leitmeritz.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Conservation Society is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
The sorting bins in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage containers, and in the villages of South Moravia, you can find the sorting garbage containers on foot.
What about Brno?
There you would have to take a few minutes to find the right bins.
I'm not saying that the waste separation system in Brno would not work at all.
But I think the councillors are not taking this problem seriously enough, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the race for the first place in the world of waste, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastic in sorting containers, but above all because of the number of tons of waste for such waste.
Have you ever tried, at the centre, to, say, dispose of the PET bottles in a collection bin?
It's art, and it takes time and nerve.
The only place I've found so far is the mooring area opposite the affected goose.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be upset, but I think that is far too little.
Except that the waste separation is not easy in other parts.
That's why a lot of my friends don't even sort garbage.
I was lazy.
They're too far from the garbage can.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But on Konicova Street, I didn't see any paint bins in sight.
Luckily, I got to the right place when I took the tram.
The garbage was almost overflowing.
This is still the centre of Brno, representing the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some sort of aesthetic will probably leave the Brünner Socialists cold.
They'd rather buy the city a hockey league that would shame us all across the republic than buy a few more tons of trash and offer to sort out more raw materials for a cleaner well.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick leave
The Left Party has given farmers and officials more money, despite the government's view, so there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and building savings.
But not for the interest on the national debt or for the international legal dispute.
This will cause even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed through the pay increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for sensitive expenses, pensions, or sick pay. "It's just postponing the problems for the future, laying mines", says Janota.
The loans are usually paid at higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too many choices to choose from, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or the costs of state enterprise are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
The pension or the sickness benefit, which has lost 1.8 billion from their accounts, people don't have to worry about, they get that money.
But at the price of the fact that the state is indebted even more - next year the state treasury will not only be missing 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase more and more rapidly and with it the costs and interest.
The government will need the money to compensate, and then it will no longer be enough to raise VAT just slightly or cut maternity pay as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The majority of these are the sections which have been won in the competition and which cannot be redesigned and which may be made cheaper.
At most, they get what they want, which is not free.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of European railway companies in the EU to around 30 million.
The CSSD has proposed that it tackle the outflow of money in a Solomonic way - it attacks the CEZ share dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed to the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion went into the budget from the CEZ.
The dividends are used annually to pay for environmental damage, to replenish the pension account and to provide a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP under EU rules.
But that is not the end of the carnival of upheavals.
Almost three billion fell in the budget for various compensation payments to victims of communism and crime or for legal proceedings, even for building savings.
It's not clear the state can manage without that money.
It's a game of chance.
If we lose an international court case, we'll have to pay anyway, Janota makes clear.
The Minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government's budget reserve.
The Commission has also proposed a new programme for the development of a European network of electronic communications networks.
The first phase starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will be imposed, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems.
Americans expect a mobile phone in the future, where the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
Just press a button and Windows Mobile will be Android in seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which is mainly focused on developing virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate these into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware suggested in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and first demonstrated a few days ago.
It's coming out in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to the journalists the smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM running the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to be available to customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is a problem for hotel owners
Sneakers are not just for the Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering skiing stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That's why you can still get free rooms in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our sites are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they're afraid to order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", said Spindl.Info's operator, Martin Jandura.
If you want to spend New Year's Eve in the spindle mill exactly as you want, you should not hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save money and the quality of your stay is secondary to your needs, you can try waiting a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly weekly stays for New Year's Day.
I think they're going to try to sell it for a while, but then they're going to have to give in and go in shorter.
And then the available rooms will quickly disappear, Jandura estimated.
Free beds are always available at the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
We have about half the seats still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas holidays for the last moment, said the director of the Ingtours travel agency, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free seats here.
Good sales are also found in the first two weeks of February, and the rest of the winter dates are sold out on average.
This year, the interest in winter holidays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if it's going to snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed in a week, the Christmas market will be sold out, Schiefert says.
The opposite is true, and it is a little better than last year, when the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou are occupied.
We're about five percent better than last year.
We only have a few rooms available on New Year's and Christmas.
There is a great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and business will be good in February, said Karel Rada, the director of the best Pec hotel.
The hotel Omnia at the central car park in Janske Lazne is also 80 per cent occupied for New Year's Eve stays.
But at Christmas, the newest hotel in Janske Lazne will have half the beds available.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are now about 60 percent occupied.
February is a little weaker, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will surely increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are waiting for a bigger snowfall.
Thursday should be cooler and if there is any rain, it should be snow in the mountains.
But after that, warming is expected to return, said Jiri Jakubsky of the Czech Meteorological Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost strange how eagerly Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghanistan issue, whom he himself thought the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he had been copying it on the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario for three years.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward" without hesitation.
He himself, three years ago, criticized the Bush idea of sending fresh troops into Iraq, which was plagued by civil war, as "irresponsible and with its consequences disastrous".
But the months that followed showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only one possible and so successful that Iraq is no longer mentioned in the news.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, for objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting position than could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping for a repeat of the miracle.
He was again asked by the military to increase the troop contingent, especially by the commander in chief of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even criticized the hesitant gunmen in the White House despite his subordination habits.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to turn the tide.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't come up with a better idea, and so he cheated the general out of at least 10,000 soldiers.
He has pressed Europe to pledge another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic aspect of the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process in three years.
Some doubt that the halving of the increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-structured, its leaders honoring values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication that no one can be trusted and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if formally correctly established, remain mere mock-ups behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the ambiguity of the circumstances, which further complicates the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The creation of a 'state capable of action', which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
The timeline of Obama's strategy, alienated by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the little soldiers who have broken out into the war cry about the "early return home" can create a miracle here can only a truly romantic soul, who is not impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date of the withdrawal of troops is irresponsible because the Taliban will take it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the European willingness to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is running out.
The European politicians cannot and will not explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Indo-Cussian highlands.
Another possible factor that could radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not have an effect, the United States will have to ask itself a very serious question: can the problem not be solved with troops?
This question must be answered as the post-Obama America moves to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic change in the situation in Afghanistan.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential election, and thus enough time for him to resort to another strategy in case it proves to be a total failure.
The managers of Goldman Sachs Bank no longer receive cash bonuses
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers gets shares instead of money, but they can't sell them for another five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers if they act in an excessively risky manner.
Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to link Wall Street's premium bonds with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I think Wall Street is aware of the broader direction it is headed in, said former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire for setting aside nearly $17 billion in bonus money for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to Reuters, despite the measure announced today.
The high bonuses in the banking sector have become the most hotly debated political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-time 50 percent tax on bankers' bonuses that exceed 25,000 pounds.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record women have today received this year's Nobel Prizes in the disciplines of literature from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research on chromosomes.
The prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath, together with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyses of the economic report.
The only subject in which no woman won a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
The prize was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel medals and a certificate of the monetary prize.
The amount is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the prize money shall be shared among them.
As is traditional, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the American President, Barack Obama, this afternoon in Oslo.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversy surrounding his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also leading a country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in keeping with his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to achieve world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Vaclav Klaus receives Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for next year as approved by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps Janota's continued presence in the cabinet will be the topics of Friday's meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
He said the budget deficit was too high, which also deepened the public finance crisis.
The meeting was informed by the President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota will hold talks with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday to discuss whether he will remain in office.
The budget law,which Klaus is now signing, would have meant a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The government has resisted the proposals of the Social Democrats to increase the budget deficit in secret.
The left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party on the other, have thus become the subject of a sharp internal political dispute, which raises the question mark about the further work of the Fischer Cabinet, which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed to form in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed by the Fisher government in the autumn and which they believe is intended to end the national debt.
Klaus, who can sign the state budget law but is not obliged to, said at a breakfast discussion with businessmen today that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He believes that there is no good solution today.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States which are not in a position to take part in the European Union.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, said the budget was terrible and the government should consider its continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told CTK that the concept of the civil servants' cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer called similar words "strong statements".
CSSD chief Jiri Paroubek reacted to Topolanek's words that the state deficit was terrible, that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that it exceeded 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD had already approved the state budget for the coming year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in the new Clint Eastwood movie
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeatable" shows the world much of the country's struggles and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was played by an American actor.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid system of government in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role is Matt Damon.
I said, "If I'm gonna play you, I need to meet you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in the Eastwood box office drama "Million Dollar Baby", had already portrayed the leader of the abolitionist movement, who eventually became a slave owner, a fictional US president, a dar and even God in "Evan the Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active role in ending apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unconquered", and it is also the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he would speak
The film depicts a true story of Nelson Mandela's team with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are the outsiders of the world.
Finally, the South African team will advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in a way that made it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt like I knew what you were feeling, he said.
It's important to me to have become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in the film, in which the white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, and he opened, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie, I look much bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, it has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Undefeated" and there is also talk of prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-executed film".
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground during the missile tests also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or damaged in mid-air.
The Russian newspapers are already writing about "Bulava" as a "rocket that does not fly".
A Rocket That Doesn't Fly But Shines
This was the 13th attempt, and it went smoothly at first.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred again.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time, Bulava was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was sailing under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
So it's likely that the mysterious light over the northern paths caused by an unidentified flying object was actually the damaged Bulava.
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted from the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The general public has this time been against it, claiming that it is not possible to speak clearly of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test launch was flawless, the Defense Department's leadership only considers six of 13 to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success rate is therefore a source of optimism for the general public, and it is still claimed that the Bulava will fly without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads weighing up to 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defenceman Vyaceslav Fetisov is back in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup champion is helping his team CSKA Moscow in need, and will likely be playing in Friday's KHL match against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov has been training regularly and has agreed to support the team.
We just need to clear up some remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
It's unclear if the comeback of the famous hockey player will be limited to one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the morale of other players, said Nemcinov.
If Fetisov returns to the ice, he will be the oldest Russian professional ice hockey player, according to the AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at age 51 and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the Famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
He has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also had success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in the Detroit shirt.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has given in to the unions.
The management of the Nosovice Hyundai car factory agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
The union has announced its readiness to strike on Monday because of frequent overtime.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
The management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed because two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday 28 November shift.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they get paid the overtime allowance or they can take a holiday on 28 December to extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees are paid for their travel and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in relation to the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to abolish all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
The employees of the car factory had been forced to work two hours overtime almost every day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
The agreement will be signed and the unions will withdraw their strike preparedness.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and the trade unions are to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike preparedness.
The situation at the car factory escalated last week, on Wednesday, when some 400 workers spontaneously went on strike over continuous overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management argued that the employees had to work overtime to meet the car delivery requirement.
The trade unions also demanded in their Monday's strike preparedness call that no sanctions be imposed on the workers who had stopped production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the unions are calling for a minimum of overtime.
In addition, they are demanding payment of the fee of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice Hyundai car factory now employs 2,000 people.
The company started mass production in November last year.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the transport sector.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'stabilized' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent HIV from spreading in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on the viruses that are already drug resistant.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have as strong an effect on common virus variants as one of the existing drugs.
The disease AIDS is not yet curable.
But the combination of drugs can extend the patient's life and prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, taking them can have a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral replication also leads to the development of resistant viruses against which no drugs are effective.
The work of experts from three institutes at the Academy of Sciences CR, the University of Chemical Technology Prague and Heidelberg University is paving the way for tackling virus resistance.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metallocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block viral replication in a way that is different from any drugs currently used, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metallocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-layered cages made of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A Devious and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus splitting caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would be produced.
By shutting down the HIV protease, we also shut down the virus' replication in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is then systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effects of these anti-HIV protease agents were tested in a test tube, including against their resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metallocarborans on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinical medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of further chemical configurations, make metallocarborans interesting compounds for further research into the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS went after Fischer, he fought back.
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "horrific" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS was described by the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
Supposedly, it'll give you time to analyze.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the civil service cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament to fight the growing deficit or whether he wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approaches of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with Left Party amendments totalling more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the Social Democrats' proposals to increase the budget deficit in secret.
The Czech Republic was to have a deficit of DKK 163 billion.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, thus meeting the wishes of the Government, because the amended budget is also only a less bad variant of the provisional budget.
Disappointment and Meaninglessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would have been different.
According to Czech TV, Janota reported to the Prime Minister's office on Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he is considering continuing in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to pass deficit-increasing laws, such as those on sickness benefits and pensions or the reform of the Labour Code.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
That is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
It mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy positions who claim to be in TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to forgo the fight against the high deficit levels of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left majority that is currently in parliament".
I am not sure that the Commissioner is aware of this.
I have not thought about it, and if it is going to be relevant, I will deal with it, said Martin Bartak, the defence minister nominated by the Citizens' Democrats, to journalists in Parliament.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial interests are protected.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister specifically asked the MPs of the Citizens' Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he said when asked whether the ODS had been pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I resigned from the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about Bolshevisation of the Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
The new timetable of the CD (Czech Railways) will see fewer trains running for approximately the same fare.
The Czech Railways will stop or limit some of its less-used express and local trains from 13 December, while other services will be increased.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the date of the new timetable.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will remain unchanged.
The railway operates Pendolino trains on this route.
The express train will no longer run to Bratislava (Pressburg).
The Commission has also decided to reduce the number of express trains on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis line and to reduce the number of direct connections from Prague to Letohrad.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz), by a total of 8%, while Prague and the surrounding area can expect an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tabor-Budweis route will also be cancelled and the operation of some express trains on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
The main changes include the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the 15th route of the Esko suburban transport system, which is being opened thanks to the electrification of the railway from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance trains to the capital will end at the Prague - Central Station station.
The CD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at two-hour intervals.
The pendolino has been banned from travelling to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million more
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and the railways will receive a total of four billion crowns next year to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss, just as they did this year.The local trains supply the districts, and they will pay a total of eight billion crowns next year, with the state contributing three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
The railways have renewed a ten-year contract for local and high-speed trains, whereas the contract has only been for one year.
The railways are praising the system, perhaps that is why they have not raised the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
The only changes are for CD Net one-day tickets and eLiska low-cost tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 to 600 kroner.
The eLiska price will then depend on the distance travelled, until now it was uniform for travel between any districts and cost 160 kroner.
The Philippines has arrested more than 50 people, and the children have been released.
Militants kidnapped 75 people today in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP news agency, which initially reported only 65 abductions.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a human shield to escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to get the rest of the hostages out.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police were pursuing the kidnappers because of the violence, which called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, the province of Maguindanao was under martial law following the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was linked to the election for governor, were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film, "Invictus: The Unconquered", will hit theaters in the United States, which includes a portion of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was given to Morgan Freeman, who had already been allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
The film's release is also being met with a mixed reaction from critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela is here .
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakhar Prize, and in 1993 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
High expectations are being placed on the film because it comes at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the World Cup, while the media are shocking the world with alarming reports of rising racial hatred and discrimination by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reaction to the new film in South Africa is generally positive for now, despite numerous reservations about casting American Hollywood stars in the lead roles.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new movie, though, in his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for many years and I've prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person so that I could, as they say, receive his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival.
I think it's good that we can use this film to remember Mandela's personality and his message.
This is a South African story, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the rugby team uniform
The film is based on the book by British author John Carlin, 'In the Role of the Enemy': Nelson Mandela and the Game That Uniteded the People, portrays the South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to bring together two racial and ethnic groups that have been separated from each other for years and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also steps on the field in his role as the South African national rugby team, which won the World Cup.
For stepping onto the lawn in a dress, which is considered almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela received a standing ovation from the white public, and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby World Cup may bring people together again as one people, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves remains to be seen.
White South Africans are sceptical, however, as revealed in a recent interview for LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country for Britain.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers are burning for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switch plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny region.
According to the spokesman of the fire department of the district of Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units responded to the fire.
Initially, the fire department wanted to let the transformers burn out, but later they changed their mind and now they are extinguishing the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal transformer short.
No one was injured, but the accident did not endanger the safety of the pipeline system, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, the damage will be more precisely quantified only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced with a new one, according to Mandatova.
She added that for over 10 years, nothing like this had happened at Ceps, and that mistakes of this kind were rare.
According to Sona Holingerova, spokeswoman for the North Bohemian CEZ, electricity was not interrupted and the fire did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV electricity supply lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, which transmit electrical energy to a distribution system and a 4339 km long line.
Jancura is filing criminal charges for defamation against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed criminal charges for defamation against three social democratic leaders.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the situation in the country.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in certain districts.
However, all regions have signed longterm contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders are attacking us and saying we're taking out the raisins, when we've only made the offer beyond the scope agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways, which were finalized last week.
Then we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander against the Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he claimed that he had evidence from all the districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek sees the criminal complaint as a continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that in this case too it will become clear that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising that would point to the unfavorable move by the districts.
He told the radio journal that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed to operate the regional rail service with the Czech Railways and no tender was issued for the 150 billion-krona contract.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, a CSSD member of parliament had already threatened him because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was that if we didn't do that, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a CSSD member of parliament, I know who he is, I won't say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free of charge and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcus will change the pattern from January.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But there are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal disease are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurers must pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children born on or after 2 August of the previous year can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine.
If you have started vaccination in the last year or earlier, you will have to pay for further repeat vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine must be given between the third and fifth month of life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of young children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between $300,000 and $450,000 a year on the vaccine doses.
But they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all the childhood vaccinations.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal infections cause inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be consulted on the draft directive.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be compulsory in the future.
From January, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
The head of the Nahlas citizens' association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned, for example, that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been campaigning for the pneumococcal vaccine for a long time.
The experts at the international conference our association was attending were not very happy that we had voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to enforce at least that.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, president of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
"In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one", says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcal disease by next year.
The first area vaccination is paid for by the health insurance, not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, so they can save for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, raises a concern among practicing pediatricians regarding the procurement of the vaccines.
The original plan was for the vaccines to be purchased by the insurance companies and then given to doctors in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state.
Some MEPs, however, feared that insurance companies would "take money out of health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for insurance to pay for them.
It is estimated that the individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 kroner a month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania State Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
It's been said that Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
Eighty-one-year-old Frank Frazetta Sr. is famous for his portrayals of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that Frazetta Jr. claimed, according to a police affidavit, that he was instructed by his father "to break into the museum by any means necessary to get all the paintings into a warehouse".
The agency said Frank Frazetta Sr. denied giving any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
The Ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
The main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public payroll for 2011.
Social security worker
The unions have protested that low-wage workers are being punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of "problems" ahead.
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has angered the private sector, which says it is a tax on jobs, even though the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect some 10 million workers.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
Increase in social security by a further 0,5 % from April 2011
This year's economic contraction is more than expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
The 1% corporate tax increase for small businesses was rejected
Tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 poorer per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would fall on the top 5% of earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increases and spending cuts were "a drop in the bucket" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers. They will halve the deficit and this is also essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour's forecasts of future economic growth  affecting the scale of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction  have been called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy was likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April  while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"A missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who are set to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis", said the planned £789 billion debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that ministers had failed to present a credible plan for how they would repay this and were "cynically" pressing ahead with difficult decisions until after the election - which must be held by June 2010 at the latest.
"They have said nothing of importance about what they are going to do", said Shadow Chancellor Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this and they let it pass".
"The important announcements will be made only after the election, whoever wins it".
The Commission has already taken a decision on the application of this Regulation.
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be spared future cuts, unlike the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit cut coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money raised by the tax increases and spending cuts is being used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that some things at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April - would expose the Chancellor of the Exchequer to accusations of vote-rigging, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists that the extra aid will be provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
The 'hollow budget'
Although the ministers have not released budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only begin to build in the medium term.
The renowned Institute for Tax Research said the Chancellor's figures would mean big cuts in many areas, possibly including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
"It only postpones the pain", said his supervisor, Robert Chote.
"The big announcements are made after the election, whoever wins", added Roger Bootle, an economic consultant at the auditing firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary report.
FBI is investigating arrests of US citizens in Pakistan.
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it's investigating whether these are the same men reported missing in Virginia last month.
The State Department said they're also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are being charged with and the circumstances in which they are being held", spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was briefed on the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay if they are indeed the missing students", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said local police had already taken an interest in the house and that no charges had been filed against the men arrested.
Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but said the United States must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as it has been for the past 20 years.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the start of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, the authorities have shown no tolerance for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face", he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations but admitted that abuse took place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he and 75 others were held for more than eight weeks in a container at a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response to it, but that Amnesty's mandate and the power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees were not made public.
The group said that at least 90 people have been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was installed in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a race track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the hill in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-meter-long slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said the view from the top of the hill was beautiful, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the city lights glittering underneath.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent".
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted to ban minarets and there is widespread concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can and are integrated into one of Europe's most secularised societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and argumentative study of a controversial issue that divided and occupied the country for a decade and a half and whose effects are still felt today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that now offer what Bowen calls "Islamic freedom" to the five to six million Muslims in France.
He is a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that worry them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up everyday life, in contrast to the political dramas that the media are busy with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom have a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don't have all the arguments on your side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed by Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts - proponents of purist Sunni Islam, which is linked to Saudi Arabia - who today have a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He sees a "tightening of the screw" rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, you are inclined to say, "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Desolate Prospect in the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks them is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently ventured into the open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear, in On Thin Ice.
He is well versed in the complex history and politics of whaling and describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proved themselves in the hunt for polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea, fighting only with the barrel of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century featured 75 polar bears in one performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the range of a wild animal, and the climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore has turned green from the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, the hunt continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sleds use powerful Inuit assault rifles to hunt their prey.
Ironically, the waters north of these two hunting nations will be the ones that will last the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing account of Arctic science and a gripping glimpse into what the future might hold.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not because of a lack of explanatory attempts.
The pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first suggested the swirling of the pack ice.
During the Cold War, submarines measured the moving reefs when they were underwater.
A useful addition is satellite surveys and the large-scale deployment of probes on icebergs, but still much is accomplished by fearless people camping outdoors in the cold.
Anderson takes a peek into the strange, tiny world of the tidal system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater streams that are compressed as they freeze.
But everything from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all of them are at risk if the summer ice disappears, which is expected to happen between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... it could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths at Arlington
Corporal De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women whose footsteps they walked.
In a few months, wherever we're brought back from, we could be", Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, started the tradition in 1992 when he and a few others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
It's now an 18-year-old tradition, and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at the graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas of the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated over $150,000 for the second time to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who sacrificed.
She said it was a small contribution from us civilians to support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family cemetery.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older graves from World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War because they are not visited as often as newer ones, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful, children playing, and couples holding hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is nearby and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends clung to one another in the icy air.
Some read out the names carved into the stone, while others stooped to small black-and-white placards that had been placed in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears at the grave of her son.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the grave of Marine Petty Officer David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"When I'm long gone, I want someone to remember him".
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was selling cell phones and laptop computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials at the U.S. Consulate in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not yet been released, although Cuban law allows for the arrest of Cuban citizens or foreign visitors for almost anything on the charge of "endangering".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protest and critical writing, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been refused.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
News of the arrest was first reported Friday night by The New York Times.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will respond if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and popular products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only since this year allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, which is mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wages.
Internet access is extremely restricted on the island.
It's available in expensive hotels and foreign visitors and in some government offices, like universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites are restricted.
It's rare to arrest an American in Cuba.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, spokeswoman for the U.S. mission in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information to make an arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - giving away free cell phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of Human Rights Watch, which recently released a harsh report on freedom in Cuba titled "New Castro, Equal Cuba", a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the country's leader, replacing the ailing elder brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that very often the accused were arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when both countries are moving toward each other for more dialogue.
Pakistani officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered a supposed leader of a conspiracy to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hope the case could help expose an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a shady insurgent known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after tracking them down because one of them had posted comments on the YouTube video site approving of terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men upon their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's Tribal Belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said on Saturday Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest that have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That's why they were rejected, said the government official, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were not discouraged and continued to try to get proper referrals to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role recruiters play in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American recruiters are subject to special screening by al Qaeda, analysts said.
But because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that in recent years terrorist groups have also become much more careful about who they allow access to, as US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to squeeze someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more Internet-based.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate change from the negotiators at the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little was happening at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city with banners that said in English, "There is no Planet B", and one in Spanish, "The Earth says enough".
Some celebrities joined the protest, such as Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that her trips to Peru, her mother's home country, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to spread the word and call on world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
Police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one bystander, who did not want to be named because he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes detonated several explosive devices near the Copenhagen Main Canal, near which several ministries are located.
They dropped them near buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares but were then followed by "a couple of big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of key officials, such as Su We, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international discussions, he replied in English: "That's something I wasn't even aware of".
He then went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is so big, I can't hear what's happening outside".
He noted that it depended on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with negotiations or the freedom of other people".
The results of the survey show persistent racial disparities
The math performance reports were welcome good news for public schools in Washington, D.C. last week.
Although Washington County still lags far behind the nation's top performing schools, the evidence shows that fourth- and eighth-graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average score of white fourth graders in Washington, D.C., has increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the past two years, but that of their African-American peers has increased by only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, dropping by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not more encouraging.
The gap between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the scores of the children in both groups have increased over that time, the difference has hardly decreased, now at 58 points.
Some district education advocates last week expressed concern that the results, which were hailed by school principal Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were driven largely by white students who are already high-achieving kids.
This suggests that we've raised the overall score by treating those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal education in Washington, D.C.
I'm not jumping up and down for a two- or three-point margin, said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what I'm worried about is that we're not spending nearly as much time and energy as we would have on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-achieving students.
For example, this fall some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which targets students in the upper grades of primary and secondary school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum that emphasizes play and real-life experiences from kindergarten through sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former superintendent Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue to work on getting the best measures to benefit students below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while still providing the extra money and resources for the underperforming schools needed to close the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools that are in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could have political consequences that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness, of course, is that, like other city school inspectors, it's trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure that we build a great school system.
We need to strengthen our schools in the suburbs so that all families, no matter where they live, can be sure that their children can get an excellent public school education.
Janey, now a Newark school superintendent, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements in closing the achievement gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, D.C., to compete with charter schools.
The school year must be increased to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year on 185 days a year, which he sees as "a milestone" on the way to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a future prospect
The bus will reach Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades, and the emerald-green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude, and that of the other eighth-graders in the group exploring Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was more that of a reverent visitor than that of an enthusiastic prospective student.
"Yes, I'll be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who was eager to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told of the school's low teacher-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh one the kids went to on their three-day tour, and now they've fully captured the intended message: The question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to move up into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanic Americans graduates from college -- which is a remarkable feat, given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the nation's workforce.
Those who study high-achieving children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of kids like her get into college, especially if these efforts continue over time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents lack the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, a single measure at some point will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis who studied Hispanic-American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these kids from preschool through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
It's known as GEAR UP -- up a gear -- and it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone on to college.
Iraqi oil ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to persuade major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed by the Iraqi oil ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play a major role in the renovation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been crippled for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies were only able to buy shares in two of the 10 fields being auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid was the one that pulled the short.
Two American companies were able to sign contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly-seated representatives of American oil giants at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There won't be any more deals in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the US military, have likely deterred American oil companies from becoming more involved in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves, analysts said.
US firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases because competitors, particularly Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies able to enter into contracts with the Department.
Larger US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties to the Iraqi oil ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, have come up empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with big packages of contracts for two major fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to becoming one of the world's great economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and will fulfill its obligations to Iraq.
The bids were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase output from each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missile strike along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is said to have killed a top al Qaeda operative this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a senior member of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs reportedly killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle heading towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents suspected of being militants rushed to the scene and quickly took what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities could not confirm the identities of the victims, but two officials from the US counterterrorism agency cited vague evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as an Al Qaeda military planner who has led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wished to remain anonymous, pointing to the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If you take his central role for granted, it included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen quickly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and had best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but that in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has dropped from an average of six operations a month to two since the summer, according to a summary in the Long War Journal, a nonprofit website.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
The UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN's top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The oath of office comes as the Obama administration decides to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the US timetable for the military withdrawal, which is set to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the buildup of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in troops on the military side must be matched by an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but was fulfilling an agreement made with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to be sent to the UN.
I would like to convey Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now so that he has time to find a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun the search for a replacement, according to UN officials.
UN officials say he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
His position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and of covering up evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has denied all allegations, but he also said that the allegations by Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly hurt the mission because there was already a high degree of skepticism about international interference in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying this would strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN recruitment regulations had undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that I can only hire one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster and must not go on.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for not participating in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq during a seven-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplaying the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that I care about is, if we've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, the unpredictability of war".
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" was needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
In a statement on Friday from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US government joined European leaders in warning that Iran must expect "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that nuclear technology is to be developed for peaceful purposes only.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks to curb its nuclear programme and give up a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have since left the negotiations on the interim agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran simply stopped the international community from making some proposals that they had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they never have in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "oppressive sanctions".
In a statement in New York, Iran's representation at the United Nations condemned what it called "groundless and unfounded allegations" by some Security Council members on Thursday about Iran's nuclear activities and said it was ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to find a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly over borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce the U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to allay Kurdish concerns about the impending troop withdrawal, with U.S. officials quoting Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you".
A change in course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that told them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave".
They learned those lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who were suddenly starting to change course this summer because of the low birth rate and the aging population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No way".
We've already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There's nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy produced two generations of notoriously fat, spoiled single children, affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis is escalating in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, down from 6 when the policy was introduced, according to the UN's
The Department of Population and Development has set a target for the number of people aged 60 and over to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 and older made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the population that is ageing and to alleviate the labor shortages of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old - but not as rich - as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden", she said.
A Gradual Relaxation
Enshrined in the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is likely the most controversial provision ever enacted by the ruling Communist Party.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed the policy to avoiding the critical use of the country's natural resources, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to have an abortion.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, government representatives for population have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Studies at Peking University, said government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city has sent city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and pass out information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial counselling to be provided for those with more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing Response
Although officials from a small rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai said there was a surge in applications from couples who wanted a second child after the campaign began, the urban districts reported no change.
For example, Huinan Municipality, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications a month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the city's projected birth rate for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai's Caolu Municipality, said financial considerations are likely the main reason why many people don't want more children.
She said they want to give their first child the best.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that it is also legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have little government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly view the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we're being denied the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply a political one.
The problem is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, said that she only wanted one child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we do not really want to".
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old owner of a translation company, was blunt.
For middle-class parents with dual careers, which causes birth rates to drop, he said, it's all about being successful and you have to be selfish to be successful.
The age group of today's 20 to 39 year olds grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China's capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places enormous demands on the parents' time.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to remodel your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "By the time the child is nine months old, you have to have a resume for the best kindergartens".
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to have achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many casualties.
UN group draws up plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference - which has so far been marked by wild poses and mutual accusations - re-focused on Friday on the release of a document that sets out an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations bearing the brunt of the burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has identified both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as a major step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time as more than 100 top politicians from around the world arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, drafted by a special UN working group, omits the amount of money rich countries should give to poor countries to help them cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be for policy makers to contribute.
The process will be given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, has called "the big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement whereby developed nations would jointly cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would cut their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, these countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave a boost to talks on Friday by pledging $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from tackling floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that had dominated the talks last week.
The US climate change special envoy Todd Stern has rejected formulations that call for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if these are not financed by the developed nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration was taking a tougher line on China than the Bush administration did less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign a deal without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern's remarks came an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the top US climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or was "highly irresponsible" to say earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to tackle global warming.
The future economic course of the great world powers is at stake, and this has created a rift between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current battle is about saving individual economies as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have moved to be more aggressive in holding countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, says Ulate, who is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most affected by climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island states' offensive "put political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now united and demanding action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks gained a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most outstanding issues still needed to be resolved before the leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials, including India's environment minister Jairam Ramesh and China's vice minister, boarded their planes and rested in the hallways of the Bella Center for closed-door meetings and press conferences to discuss claims that will be heard over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people walking in and out of the convention center every day, activists playing guitar hosting late-night shows mocking the countries they think are betraying and selling, and draft treaties being handed out hand-to-hand instead of by email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the top", said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first high-speed train redefines the feeling of Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday, a whistle will pierce the darkness to announce a train departure that will revolutionize transportation in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h on its blitz from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Secretary of State for Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and link the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become a vibrant commuter town, commuting times would be radically reduced and switching from airplanes and cars to trains would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still put a brake on Britain's high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will submit its report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line, which will link London with the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and places where environmental impacts are controversial, with a clearance of five metres.
In open terrain, the plan will show the concept within 25 metres of the final route.
HS2 will also develop three options for a larger northbound high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped line with a single high-speed line leading into the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham and a branch would run west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option", said a railroad insider.
Once completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open until 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour today.
The plans will allow trains to run at 400 km/h, making the UK rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was designed to accommodate 400-meter trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 passengers.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be running on the London-Birmingham line.
This in turn would mean that a terminal would be needed in London to handle 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks this plan should be pursued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning process means that a final decision will not be made until after the general election.
But even if he can get the wheels moving, the rail network has to be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing railway lines north of Birmingham, which would keep the journey time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is seen as a crucial tipping point in ensuring a change from airplanes to railways, a stepping stone to the railway revolution.
Taxpayers are paying for a £75,000 mortgage on a Conservative orangery .
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative MP, has been charging taxpayers thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The prison party spokesman, demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the House of Commons live on "meagre rations", has raised his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed house on his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer for the extra interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons approved the motions at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is reviewing the expenditure of members of the House.
Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby homes have been priced at almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, a spending control unit of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he planted a winter garden, which the plans call "orangerie".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased cash withdrawal during a recent review of his previous mortgage contracts by the Standards and Privileges Committee.
The Committee cleared him of breach of regulations last month after examining his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a £271,406 mortgage from his London home to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election to Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan was getting about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest back by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than £1,800 (US$1,500) a month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the entire increase was to finance the cash withdrawal of £75,000 (EUR85,000).
The normal RBS unadjusted mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his £1,250 a month in May.
Duncan lost his position as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying after the spending scandal that MPs would live on "meagre rations".
"Basically, working for the state means living on meager rations and being treated like shit".
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I claim a small part of it, which is in proportion to what is rightful.
And I could have asked for the whole damn amount, but I'm not".
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May over his spending when it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he cleared with the Fee Office that this could be considered an "excessive demand".
An activist has dug a hole in Duncan's lawn in the shape of a pound sign in protest after it became known that he had been demanding 4,000 pounds over three years.
When asked last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fee Office and subsequently by Legg for an increase in value".
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and dodging or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is completely transparent and strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer".
Come all you faithful to admire Brighton's beach hut advent calendar
Brighton beach huts have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discovery through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols as a theme for each December.
The event started on December 1 and visitors were allowed to view the newest hut every day from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", with the hut decoration here being the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer minister in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion important again for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the Advent Calendar for Beach Cottages started as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express that through our spirituality".
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the world on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement to combat climate change, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police and 100,000 according to organisers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital on the sidelines of the UN climate conference, which is due to conclude on Friday and could enter into force in 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chair of the climate conference, said the growing global climate mobilisation is helping to illustrate that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed by, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed shop windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Riot police responded immediately and without any consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, most of whom they believe to be members of the 'blacks blocs', these extremely violent splinter groups which have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were detained "without distinction", stressing that about a hundred of them were "still being held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in a sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has left the Parliament and headed for the Bella Centre where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for a candlelight evening attended by former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from the major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as well as some Africans.
Some 3,000 people, most of you in blue raincoats, made a first pitch in Copenhagen this morning as you responded to the call from Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand redress for the ecological debt of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry up, streams where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of critics of globalization has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, a critic of globalisation, announced that he had come to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for a different world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, has given the demonstrations their start.
Some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, marching in red and holding banners, where you were praising solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand vigorous action on climate change.
In France, demonstrations organised by the 350 network drew several hundred people in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "joke".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "joke".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 5pm GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polls closed, according to Abkhaz election commission officials.
The first preliminary results were to be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including the incumbent president, Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
This election is a farce.
The European Union has also expressed its concern about the situation in Abkhazia, which is under total Russian occupation, its spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After seceding from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station that was in a school in the capital Sukhumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful scenery on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch with the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and Vladimir Putin, are all over this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the east of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, prepared a warm welcome for the Russian representatives who had come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, particularly in the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia gives Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round of voting must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, ready to respond at any time, arrested about 700 people on the sidelines of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, demonstrated in the chilly afternoon in the Danish capital, which will host delegates from 193 countries until December 18th, seeking an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
From the Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Centre, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to break in.
A stage was set up to welcome the scheduled speakers for a candlelight evening attended by former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers began smashing windows, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police immediately surrounded you and then they intervened without consideration by throwing some of you to the ground.
Police have announced that 600-700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the 'blacks blocs', these extremely violent splinter groups which already became famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a policeman suffered a jaw injury from a cobblestone during the incidents, in which about twenty people were arrested, according to the police.
"We have the extremist groups under control", police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen declared as law enforcement helicopters circled in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or in their own vehicles from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
But there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first group in Copenhagen this morning to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice" following the call of the "Friends of the Earth".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt to the people of the South be repaid", said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition from the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say: 'We still have time,'" says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are streams that you can walk through that never used to be".
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organizations.
José Bové, a French member of the European Parliament and critic of globalisation, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice". "Today there is no longer a difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, to address the masses.
The Asian-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, organizers say, some 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, advertised solar power outside the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined the demonstrations organised by the 350 Network, particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
In Geneva, several people gathered.
The subjects of geography and history are, according to Chatel, strongly based on the reform of the lycées.
The national Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper Journal du dimanche that geography and history were reinforced by the reform of the lycées, even though they were not compulsory in the final year (12).
"The students of Première (11th year) now have all four hours a week and the same programme", confirms Mr Chatel.
The Minister said that "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but is, on the whole, a concentration of "the best students".
"The socioeconomic and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one", he continued, stressing: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical and geographical education in the terminals of technical lycées".
A survey by IFOP published in Humanité on Saturday found that almost seven in ten French (69%) are critical of the government's plan to cancel compulsory history and geography classes in Terminal S (12th year of science).
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the airport was in a similar situation to Terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of education for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest on Tuesday against the project, which they believe is a sacrifice to the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that in Master 2 (M2) they undergo a professional aptitude test at the beginning of the year and an entrance exam at the end of the year to test their teaching skills.
They also do traineeships during the year at M2 and then teach for a year before the pupils as trainee teachers.
He continued: "If you add up all the internships offered before the test, you get even more hours than you spent in front of the students, which is more than 300 hours".
The Minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - something "that does not exist in education".
He once again confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the Ecole Normale Supérieure
Fifteen minutes to talk about the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, faced on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm, Paris.
As a journalist for AFP noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts address the audience with fifteen-minute filmed speeches.
"You want to do something that reaches people and makes them want to know more", said Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organisers of the day, on the sidelines of the conference.
"Around twenty participants were selected from among the experts, also on the basis of their charisma", he says.
"You can talk about global warming for hours, but you can also talk about the core objectives in a matter of minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking to a crowd of about 50 people using only slides.
"This is part of our role as scientists", he stressed, hoping that the audience would learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier".
The videos of these conferences will be available online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Earnest Day" is scheduled for February and will be held every two months thereafter.
Late payment: angry prison guards, action planned
The unions of correctional officers called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the bonuses and overtime pay, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Penitentiary Workers' Union (FO-Pénitentiaire) called on non-employees to demonstrate and blockade the prison on Tuesday morning to draw attention to the "theft of what is theirs".
The third trade union of prison officers (CGT-Pénitentiaire) called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons" to denounce the failure to pay the overtime, night pay and Sunday and holiday pay in December as "disgraceful and unacceptable".
The first union of correctional officers, the Autonomous Federal Correctional Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations ... to show discontent and anger".
The management of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime has increased sharply in 2009 and not all of it was budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
The Ministry of Justice announced that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of prison officers guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and to modernise it", the Minister of Justice said in the letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate measures to ensure that this situation, which was caused by a lack of assessment of the overtime work, does not happen again in the future", added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December salary is therefore low, except for the management staff who enjoy high service and target bonuses, explains UFAP/UNSA, for whom the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional trade union FO in Marseille protested, announcing a boycott of "all meetings and convocations" until further notice.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays if the hours worked in October and December are still not paid, including overtime", the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne warns.
"At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without hiring more staff, it is more than inappropriate to try to enrich ourselves with staff funds", says the CGT of Bordeaux.
The trade unions say that the situation is not the same in all regions, some less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the general secretary of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama feels that he always gives out better gifts at Christmas than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he always gives out better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special broadcast Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave a glimpse of how they will spend the holidays in their new, illustrious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too", Michelle Obama reiterates, adding that the dog will also get a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year", she teases the president.
"So please", he conjured her up mischievously, pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace, "and who gave you that?"
During this hour-long, casual broadcast with the well-known television host who had been a strong supporter of Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about the gifts they loved most as children.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember my father visiting us once at Christmas and bringing me a basketball", the president said.
"It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized I had this ball from him".
The First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace", Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday undergoes surgery again, RTL confirms he's been put into a medically induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to those around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent another surgery at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday after American doctors found "damage from surgery on a herniated disc" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his Paris production company, which added that the damage required another operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and said that a new medical opinion would be available no later than 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the singer's partner during the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that the patient's condition was somewhat more certain when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that 'certain sources indicate' that 'no drainage' was laid after its first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a herniated disc.
The procedure, which was planned to take several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
He was not available for comment to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a post-operative infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley" but said there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician, who was "a good fighter".
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was stupid to sit in an airplane for 12 hours after an operation like this, that's not possible", said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was "responding well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained".
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular anxiety.
Nevertheless, the singer's health had been growing in concern since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling over on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, Johnny Hallyday was told that he had a "minor bowel cancer operation" that resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as planned as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had difficulty moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that his family had to deny him a second hospital stay.
Euro-2009/Short Track: First place for Bousquet on his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday in his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 on the short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, whereas a real record flood was expected.
One record was bettered by Evelyn Verraszto of Hungary in the 4 x 200 m relay and the other two by Russia in the men's 4 x 50 m relay.
It's a shame for Bousquet, who was trying to reach the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two king's distances in swimming, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won in 20.53 seconds in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a first at international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can always believe in bigger things, and in this case I said, if the world record is within my reach, I'll try".
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned as of January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
The combination didn't pay off this time for German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record holder.
The young swimmer failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but he still won with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give it my all this time.
I knew I couldn't break the world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task".
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future", Biedermann explained.
USA: Zola's tombstone valued at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone found in the home of French writer Emile Zola was valued at $1.5 million on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This two-meter-long, two-inch-high [63 cm] tablet, dating from the third century C.E., was valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, which "represents four scenes of Dionysus in sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of Roman and Egyptian antiquities auction at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in under a hundred pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this is certainly the part that the buyers have bid the most for so far", Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble by Emile Zola goes back far.
The plate was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family home, after which it appeared piece by piece in the hands of the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her hotel in Paris, and in the hands of Paul Reynaud, minister in the Third French Republic and president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "legacy of Emile Zola" that was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of Thérèse Raquin and the Rougon-Macquart fresco.
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to its homeland no longer compatible after the coup government rejected the transfer as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya last night, everything seems to indicate that there is currently disagreement about the way this transfer will be carried out, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authorities, the plane, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad under his guidance.
The ousted president, however, refused, wishing to return to Mexico as the most welcome head of state in office.
The coup regime "has failed again by trying to make me surrender at my expense (...), they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in a series of remarks since the start of the political crisis that has been raging in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, who had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, to the beat of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for escort, which we unfortunately cannot accept because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the coup government, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not seeking asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur channel.
He stressed that he would only leave Honduras if he was the president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of Mr Zelaya's departure had mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who had marched to and gathered around the Brazilian embassy, prompting the Brazilian military to step up its efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, he said, showed the marginal character of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day of the referendum he organised to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for high treason, which the judiciary will charge him with, according to the coup government.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
The European Parliament has also been asked to vote on the draft resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
Three days later, the Congress had voted overwhelmingly against Mr Zelaya's return to office until his term expires on 27 January.
Wall Street up, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed at an all-time high on Thursday, with the US trade balance showing a recovery in the US and its trading partners' shares: the Dow Jones index rose 0.67%, the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq rose from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 0.58 % (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various sectors, judged FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegza.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is focused on 'half-full glasses', she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the U.S. trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion compared with September.
The analysts had, on the contrary, expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in total trade, especially in goods exports, reflecting economic growth among the United States' main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of business research website Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have risen unexpectedly over the past week, now reaching 474,000.
However, the average number of new job seekers over the past four weeks has "fallen to the lowest point of the year", stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on 10-year government bonds rose to 3.482% from 3.432% on Tuesday evening, and the yield on 30-year bonds to 4.492% from 4.408% on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in Power Whistle "Ladies in White"
Several hundred Cuban partisans who are in power on Thursday whipped the wives of political prisoners who were gathering in Havana for World Human Rights Day and also foiled another demonstration that led to the temporary arrest of more than a dozen dissidents.
Around 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were whipped in the open street by partisans of Raul Castro's government as they marched into the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist told AFP.
Down with the Yankees! "Mercenaries!" "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the empowered partisans chanted with raised fists toward the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place the previous evening in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
In the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to march on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were temporarily detained by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents, who were being harassed by the government's partisans, to board civilian vehicles by force.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Ladies in White organised an unauthorised march to "call for the release of all political prisoners", which according to the dissident list numbers around 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is among the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents of the regime to be "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionaries".
The Cuban people are not only the victims of the war, but also the victims of the war.
A madman kills an 80-year-old man with a knife and leaves five injured in Clichy-la-Garenne .
A maniac armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) late Friday afternoon.
According to the first information of the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the 80-year-old in or outside a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives for reasons that have not yet been clarified, and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, died of his injuries in hospital, according to an official of the Alliance police union.
He's been in or out of the same pharmacy, prepping a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about three-quarters of an inch, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured and taken to hospital, where the 80-year-old died.
The other victim is in life-threatening condition, apparently vital organs have been affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and was reportedly hospitalized in a "shock state", according to a police source.
The gunman, who police said appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, fled immediately to the same street, Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He injured two other passersby, apparently by accident: a man in his 30s and a man in his 40s, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained in the dark that evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a local union official from the Alliance syndicate in the Hauts-de-Seine region.
According to witness reports obtained by the AFP, several passersby, including teenagers, tried to restrain the maniac.
I saw a guy in the triplets with a green vest.
Three teenagers tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
He added that a mob had attacked him, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of building 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the gunman and were stabbed, police said.
The incident took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby came up to me to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I took her to the first aid post and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, to AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, came in, wounded by cuts.
State police finally arrested the man who had no identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has asked the Criminal Police Department of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard by the court.
A police source has not ruled out that he's being committed to a mental institution.
According to another police source, six policemen were called in to restrain him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of hyperactivity" like "all those mentally disturbed people whose powers are released during the act".
US: Polanski's lawyer calls for a halt to prosecution
The lawyer for the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski repeatedly asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court in his home country of Switzerland for a moral offence committed more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", has appeared before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal, alleging gross misconduct at the time of the trial in 1977.
I demand immediate amnesty, Mr Hummel said, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time of the trial, Laurence Rittenband, "made you run cold turkey".
According to him, Judge Rittenband, now deceased, before the judge issued his verdict, argued with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", by the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
Mr Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
If the Court refuses to stay the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests that a trial be held which would enable him to produce the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the argument already made at first instance, that a discussion on the annulment of the facts against the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before his conviction for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He hasn't been to the States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant District Attorney Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
Does this matter need to send a message not only to (Roman Polanski) but to other defendants that escape is a way out?
In their opinion, "the filmmaker is asking the court for a favor and thus despising its authority".
One of the three judges  who now have 90 days to announce their decision  even stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the suspension of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for the victim, Samantha Geimer, also demanded that the criminal case be dismissed.
She reminded her client that she could no longer bear to be harassed by any re-enactment of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this process was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26th, on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street is being held back by the rise in the dollar and closes with no price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The final figures available at the close of business showed the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq rose 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index as a whole increased by 0.37 % (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is pretty quiet", noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think it will remain so until the end of the year".
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped improve the market view of the strength of the economic recovery", Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and well above forecast.
American consumer confidence also improved significantly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's index forecast.
However, the indices were held back by a further rise in the dollar against the euro, which reached its highest level in two months, 'pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation', explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose by 3,540% on Wednesday evening from 3,482% and that on the 30-year bond rose to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World re-elected in South Africa
After a month of traveling around South Africa, the 112 contestants for the title of Miss World will cross the final hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world and watch it in front of a billion television viewers.
During this major beauty fair, which is being held in the Johannesburg area for the second time in a row, five of them have already secured their tickets to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned Miss Sport or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a veritable whirlwind of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and experienced many things! said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
The competition, which is being held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, starting at 5pm (15pm CET).
I could not think of a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova underlined in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press conferences and safari, the Misses are now focused on the competition.
Indian actress Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will be present in this election as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to take home the crown, Miss India says with a big smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted by music and dance.
The candidates are parading in traditional costumes and not to forget, in bathing suits.
The show is presented by a TV presenter, Angela Chow from China, former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a Miss World committee official, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with unsurpassed warmth and pride, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, went on a safari to the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle and tasting local cuisine.
The meeting with the South African President, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand, was exceptional.
Not unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone remarked.
But her best memory is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town, South West, for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I'm dealing with people I probably never would have otherwise.
I will definitely return to the World Cup in 2010, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday upon his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
"He's very strong, everything is going very well", David Hallyday told reporters as he stepped off the plane, which arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.
The singer's son, who appeared relaxed, said he would go to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital "as soon as possible" after Johnny Hallyday was admitted to the hospital on Monday for a bacterial infection following surgery on a herniated disc in Paris on November 26.
The singer was "put into a medically induced coma in Los Angeles last night to relieve his severe pain and continue his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was put into a medically induced coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for a bacterial infection following a disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the disease-related changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French High School in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade goes to school, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of the orthopedic and trauma surgery department at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the Los Angeles hospital.
The producer has put a heavy burden on the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told he had committed the ultimate massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Mr. Camus explained.
I heard that they might be going to court, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles far too quickly and with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke to this doctor personally on the phone, and he assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which was a big surprise, since I myself had already had two open discs, he added.
Shortly before, he announced on RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma from a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, convicted of several failed operations, including tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the medical association, described him as "a man without scruples" who has to answer "regularly" to the board and is "everything but recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
He said the operation had "gone perfectly" and the post-operative examinations had been "normal".
The surgery "did not cause any bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been mounting since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that the tour will be a bit too short to continue on 8 January (at Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) party alliance is calling on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its logo.
The alliance of parties controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem party reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, to take over the seal of the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and threatened him with legal action, demanding that he no longer use the seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy after he reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to highlight his efforts, he had received the support of Member Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF trade mark, having first applied for it in 2004 at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle.
However, the office of the UDF, a party alliance controlled by François Bayrous's friends, broke its silence and made it clear that it would not be expropriated and, under threat of legal action, gave the minister and the member a deadline to stop using the seal and to transfer the ownership of the mark to it.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose that your political movement 'take over' the UDF logo, the party alliance said in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement, the slogan of the current UDF, printed on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF office stated, and urged the NC party to 'immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (its) website'.
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required to 'transfer the ownership of the mark to its legal owners'.
If you refuse, we will sue you to enforce the law and defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that the UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave in 2007 to form a rival movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the UMP party.
The party Nouveau centre therefore has no rights to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy) seal.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem party and the creation of an office to defend the 'material and moral interests' of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, 'he had been a member of the UMP for three years when he applied for the brand name' and not the UDF.
It profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the UDF acronym to do this for itself.
You also point out that this recklessness is on the verge of becoming a crime, and you ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems to us more dignified in politics and in life to make a name for yourself than to try to escape anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no legal claim".
The Liliane Bettencourt affair: François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting weakness
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a moment of weakness in the eighty-year-old to steal a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be held in court on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum three-year prison sentence and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this case worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are bragging and at the same time holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
The 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is being carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down during the investigation by the Nanterre prosecutor's office.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to submit a report by 10 March 2010 clearly stating if and when Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these tests.
I will speak to her, Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As far as Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Mr Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very satisfied with the Court's decision.
This is excellent news (...).The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who must be protected, he reiterated.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to extort donations totalling one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considered a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to review the admissibility of the lawsuit brought by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaintiffs' pleadings on Friday led to a major family scandal.
The lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt referred to three letters sent by her client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she stated that she did not trust the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage".
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again considers that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially since a guardianship judge has in recent days rejected her request to bring a legal protection action against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt 'is fully competent, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place", affirmed the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to give its judgment after the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers has been decided.
The manager revolution or the end of strategic early warning?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" determined to impose the best as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the enterprise, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering markets place... despite the authoritarian temptation to impose separate factors of product preferences on customers again regularly!
A demobilization of the staff can lead to a fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, which particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique) "demands proactive action and a forward-looking approach from all parties involved"; it demands of the employees a commitment which is completely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a corporate revolution that puts employees at the centre of the company's concerns, alongside customers.
The very limited benefit of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange has sent to its employees, stimulate this revolution in management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First, because I've found that the whole structure, faced with a new situation, after many detours, eventually comes to do what it always did.
It is also because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a very oversimplified view of human behavior.
Originating from the great engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behavioural theory that has recently been reactivated by American "neuroscience" and unwittingly spread widely by research institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to use the leverage (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the attitude of managers towards a mechanistic management system which is not suited to today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilizing factors
Instead, the industrial revolution necessary for the smooth running of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into every management consideration or practice: for the employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and plans.
At present, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a pre-defined doxa, which allows them to assess, through their perceived image of the company, what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilizing factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their 'social performance' and put their human resource management back in place.
They thus create a fertile ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama's "just war" is getting praise from the right
The American right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the night before and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who had mocked Obama's award on October 9 applauded the president's speech this time, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the face of the Republican Party's right wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her own published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
She says we have to stop the terrorists down there.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really very good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives cheered, especially acknowledging the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some respects, I felt that the speech was entirely historical, explained Ginrich, interviewed on the radio programme 'The Takeaway'.
The former congressman, seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a "leftist president" who reminded the Nobel committee members that they "could not be free and could not hand out a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush correspondent and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan", as he "always does", he spoke "like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "are living in a kind of security bubble that they didn't create and don't do much to protect", Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era hawk, called the speech on the National Review Online website "boring, arrogant and uninspiring".
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is showing concern over Barack Obama's defense of the use of military force.
He warns that if war is disguised as justice, the massacre of the innocent can be easily justified.
The moderate left press, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called the speech "monumental", even for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "provides a blueprint for international decision-making against conflict, poverty and oppression", says the California Daily.
The New York Times believes Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "both bleak and exemplary".
Long-distance drivers: three marathons for a deal to secure Christmas supplies
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the unions of the road union and the TLF - the only employers' organisation to stay until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening, ending the strike order and the looming severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was reached on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted company early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly late in the morning.
This was despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting in anger.
However, more than six hours passed between the start of the meeting at 11 a.m. and the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was not signed until 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "there was a fear that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wage groups (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages will therefore rise from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
'It is not a lot, but we are starting small,' said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now being instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some reluctant people who are not satisfied with the agreement", he adds.
The TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement" although it was "difficult to accept these wage increases in the face of international competition".
He said the increase was 170 euros a month for low-wage workers and 100 to 120 euros for high-wage workers.
'This agreement is based on common sense and respect for workers', said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) called it 'a historic agreement'.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs intended for human consumption (COM (90) 0247 - C4-0425/90)
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of the 13th month's salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of employers' taxes by €100 million" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 revised Finance Bill, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is demanding an "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be valid initially for the enterprises affiliated to this organisation and subsequently, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, for the whole profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association denounced "fraudulent trade" because the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but to avoid the goose-eaters being wiped out in the coming Christmas days, Unostra laments.
The agreement threatens to "shovel a grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the next 12 months", according to the Otre Association.
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP's proposals
Disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued over the weekend as a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike, between the unions and the management of RATP (the independent Paris passenger transport authority) kept strikers waiting for their demands for wage increases.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, no trains ran between 10am and 8pm, with only one in two trains on the central line (between La Défense and Nation) and only one in four trains outside the central line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the big stores with transport technology".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran on schedule during rush hour, and almost none during the low-traffic period.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms as the people of Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), said he would have gotten up extra "an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
SNCF, which had planned for the passengers to be assisted by staff and security personnel, pointed out that there had been no congestion at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to ensure connection to the metro lines.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers held their general meetings again to review the results which the unions had rated as "good" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Manager proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the new rules to the European Parliament.
The CGT was outraged that RATP itself had put its own wage-increase proposals in parentheses, stressing that the top management was 'unable to solve a problem whereas it was possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF'.
The RATP clarified that a further meeting on Monday was planned to "comprehensively examine working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "is ignoring the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that had so far refused any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line, following an announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The unions are demanding a wage increase of between 120 and 150 euros (Unsa), of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and are also complaining about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which is used by millions of passengers every day.
The RER drivers, who have years of experience, receive a gross salary of EUR 2 200 to EUR 2 700 and a wage surcharge of EUR 600 to EUR 650 for shift work and Sundays and public holidays.
Turkey's Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision with grave consequences
Turkey's constitutional court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult as it tries to help the Kurdish community to end the 25 year conflict.
The "Democratic Society Party" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", the President of the Constitutional Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press four days after the decision.
Kiliç said the decision was unanimous by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to enforce the dissolution.He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by the Turk and Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than act like non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a 2007 case brought by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers consider the DTP to be the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court has put the government in the middle of its efforts to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to reduce Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflicts.
DTP leaders reaffirm that a break-up could lead to a renewal of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP premises in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in the southeast.
Law enforcement used tear gas and water cannons as protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said that the court's decision would "deepen the despair even further".
"Turkey cannot solve this (Kurdish) question by banning a party", he told the press.
The government, which is made up of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are opposed to the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems", said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government", says political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"You can obviously expect a reaction from the PKK", he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service director of the FES.
It is to enable its employees to try and master the entire vehicle technology.
This weekend, meteorologists say, it could be like this for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are on standby to deal with snow and ice.
The ESF is working on a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are used by heavy-duty trucks, explains Brauburger.
These include main traffic roads and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and sloped roads, such as Atzelbergstrasse.
The FES service starts at three in the morning
The roughly 1,040 kilometers would have to be covered in moist, more adherent salt in no more than three hours if necessary.
That is why the FES starts at 3 a.m. "to keep the routes clear until the commercial traffic starts".
It's gonna be hard when it doesn't snow until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because nobody is willing to make room for the stretchers".
Only after that, if it does not snow any more, are the supply and development roads, which include the Rat-Beil-Straße, next.
The last priority is to take side and side roads.
There'll be complaints, white burgers.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot soldiers will be on the move, and the priority will be to clear dangerous points and crossings.
The FES cannot usually take care of all the cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps a close eye on bridges from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Because of this rapid smoothing, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatter is on the move.
If necessary, the police will call him.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The six-foot-long [2.0 m] and five-foot-tall [1.50 m] animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-clawed claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't have been anything special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to display these physical features, Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the relationships, the distribution and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, unprecedented for Triassic deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of five individuals.
Finding confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt says it is an extraordinary find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only found in single fragments".
Other dinosaur experts don't necessarily share that enthusiasm.
This discovery is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current theory, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the classification of these ancient dinosaurs is often controversial.
For example, experts debate when lizards split into their three main evolutionary lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "long-necks", and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithischia, which included Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of air sacs, similar to those of the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to air sacs, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light-weight bones, the common ancestor of both groups likely had produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers conclude that lizards first appeared there.
Thus, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America to all the continents that then formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
The team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other theropods, not particularly closely related.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
He believes that the picture may be distorted because South America has a particularly large number of primitive dinosaur fossils, while other continents have few.
How dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare side-line of the reptilian tribe into the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying dinosaurs and numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relatives on the border between the Triassic and Jurassic became extinct.
The success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction, and the dinosaurs just happened to survive, but the other reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flourish, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had been given a shadow existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California are all in favour.
Lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen are also present.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University is making waves around the world.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are showing solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University president Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the building, which was occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike, last week because walls and artworks had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage, the signatories say, did not justify "the violent disruption of self-organized classes by students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable interference" with freedom of research and teaching.
The focus on vandalism is "delegitimating and criminalizing protest" and distracting from the content.
The Bureau has avoided the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage, it is said.
The protest is legitimate
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's youth secretary Alexander Klein.
The Hessian Minister for Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the university president and the police.
We're grateful to the president.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information it provides.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, says CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition groups SPD, Greens and Left saw it differently.
The CDU is using painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, they cleared out.
The Left has submitted a motion asking the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, was a heavily guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the commune, with its 216,000 inhabitants and 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered "Russia's Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science centre Riedberg - with the EU institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
The Commission has also been involved in the negotiations on the accession of the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the European Union.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd, and for Frankfurt the design director Edwin Schwarz signed.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises from the research area in the natural sciences will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific companies want to get jobs in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and enterprises.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated "green city") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
The brake block of Stuttgart
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about 'the new heart of Europe'.
S21 is much more than the laying down of a railway station, more than a monstrous building project that will plunge the city of the capital of the state of Baden-Württemberg into a decade of unhealthy construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The railway terminals with tracks that terminate in the middle of the city were considered to be 19th-century transportation fossils that served as brakes on modern railway traffic, since it once took an enormous amount of time to rewire locomotives from front to back.
Drive in, stop, keep going. That's the way it should be.
And that is why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station located about halfway along the transEuropean railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
S21 is now being tackled, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost inexpensive to implement deep-level laying in the Hessian and Bavarian big city.
However, the main railway stations no longer have any problem of entry and exit, since there are modern turns with powered vehicles and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new ICE extension to Ulm are now being approached.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial interests are protected.
The railway is also taking part because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayers and not by the state-owned company.
The project is still somewhat justified from an urban point of view.
New urban spaces are being created, which, according to the computer-generated graphics of the planners, will be endowed with plenty of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger traffic, which was attributed - typically in the 1980s - to huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
Modern transport policy must, however, first of all focus on strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains because of the steep gradients.
Even more important, S21 indirectly touches many other railway projects.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
That's the official number.
Experts say 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
The fact is that in the next decade, money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a slow pace.
It is urgent to press the tube properly here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine Valley route will become a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport ruling.
The German government has left open in the Wiesbaden parliament whether it will review the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page judgment of the Supreme Court examined legally, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written on that day that the country would have to re-regulate the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The authorization of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as provided by the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population from nighttime aircraft noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to appeal the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government representatives to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The European Parliament has voted to approve the Commission's proposal to extend the deadline for the submission of proposals for the adoption of a new directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
It is very difficult to keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation by Schäfer-Gümmbel that the state government is trying to get its night flights started with "wrongdoing and trickery".
A thorough legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a new regulation on the protection of the environment.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-hit big US banks are untying their government shackles.
The Bank of America on Wednesday paid back the aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund totaling $45 billion (just 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid, according to a report by CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have come with accepting the money  such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had secured over $19 billion in new money from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the money she took from her own fund, which was well filled, among other things, by sales in the department.
Bank President Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening for the money he received.
The bank had been at the height of the financial crisis when it took over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to pay off its debts to the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a capital increase of about $20 billion, CNBC reported, citing sources.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their loans.
Quick selection
It all happened sooner than I thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors dismissed the current editor-in-chief, Nikolaus Brender, the station can present a successor.
Last night the board was supposed to vote on the staff.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Capital Studios in Berlin.
The Commission has not yet received any official confirmation from the broadcaster to avoid prejudging the proceedings.
However, it is also likely that this would have played a role in preventing further damage to ZDF's director Markus Schächter if this proposal was not approved by the board of directors.
Frey, Schachter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the committee.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the time of writing.
Two weeks ago, Schächter's proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years was rejected by the board.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him.
The Union's majority in the Board of Directors had already indicated weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
He had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He rejected a further term of office for the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that ZDF's news programmes had lost viewership under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which political influence on the ZDF was lashed out.
The last time this happened, 35 state legislators had intervened in the debate, calling Koch's action unconstitutional.
It's no use.
For the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romance.
Afterwards he worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Subsequent posts: personal assistant to the editor-in-chief from 1988 to 1990; correspondent in Washington from 1991 to 1992; editor and presenter of the morning magazine until 1998; director of ZDF foreign policy until 2001; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the election of Brender, who was elected Journalist of the Year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Last week, Koch's opponent on the board, the Rhineland-Palatinate prime minister Kurt Beck, said that the states should change the ZDF state contract so that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also ruled out a departure of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by sharply criticizing the board immediately after Brender's election.
This document of journalistic independence enabled him to be nominated by Schächter without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief and elected by the board of directors without being suspected of elevating a party member to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is assigned to the left-liberals anyway.
The study is unveiled
After a year of strikes, the ministers of education of the Länder finally agreed on Thursday to improve the conditions for studying at bachelor's and master's level.
The students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: in principle, each study module should be completed with only one examination.
The aim is to monitor the workload of students and to ensure that it is 'realistic and reasonable'.
The policy and higher education also aim to facilitate the recognition of examination results between higher education institutions inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed to making common structural requirements for bachelor's and master's programmes more flexible.
The Commission has also proposed that the Member States should not introduce any derogations.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the ministers of education and university rectors have been carrying the word of better readability in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, it has been filled with concrete content.
The accreditation board decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually ends with only one exam", says a 30-page paper that is partly reviewing the admission of degree courses.
The "significant reduction in the burden of examination", said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Council, was to "stop a development which had seriously impaired the readability".
In addition, the "studyable" is to be "the decisive criterion" in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" for "unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of courses".
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the
Students would have "the right to be given a space to enable and encourage their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses and to the review of existing courses.
These must be 're-accredited' every five years  which means that it will take until 2015 for all degree programmes to be reviewed.
The national accreditation bodies are ten and are subordinate to the Accreditation Council set up by the Länder.
In October, the ministers of culture urged countries to "strengthen" their efforts to ensure that the agencies are not too full and the screening regime is not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and colleges of applied sciences have already agreed on measures with the Länder ministries.
The only country to date to commit additional funds to the further development of the Bologna process was Rhineland-Palatinate.
The money will be used to set up tutoring programmes and strengthen study counselling and examination and study abroad offices.
The State and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
The government plans to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament in early 2010.
The aim is to ensure that the results of the studies are consistent with the results of the previous studies.
The aim is to make the curriculum more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other higher education institutions and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all the country's study programmes are to be checked for their eligibility.
The government and opposition had again clashed on Thursday over the conditions for studying in the country.
The Commission has also been criticised for its decision.
The Federal Board of the Juso University groups demanded that the formulation of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
The students concerned should now "have a say" at the latest after the educational strikes.
The future academics were supported by the President of the Conference of Rectors of Higher Education (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK is discussing a joint reform paper.
The Bonn Decisions as a whole did not go far enough for the Gewerkschaft für Bildung und Wissenschaft (GEW), which demands a legal right to access a further master's degree for all bachelor's degree graduates.
Secondly, countries must ensure that there are enough master's degree places with the best possible study conditions for today's generation of bachelor's students tomorrow, says GEW Executive Board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
The Ministers of Education did not, however, comment on a freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
"Getting in and out of Germany is almost uncontrollable"... is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he discusses in disturbing language fragments the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his speech space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Visibly unsure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to fellow Romanian-German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his collaboration as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
In 1989, Söllner and some of those present had received the German Language Prize.
Recruitment attempts had started in a slow fashion, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "someone who has not defended himself enough against the Securitate's attempts to intimidate".
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania is being shaken by a case that reveals the abyss and the lowliness of a political system based on surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell, not only a perpetrator but also a victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter had played a role, said literary scholar Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He had "hit him out" in all the difficult areas for him at the time, Markel said.
It is a moral imperative for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was in form and to this audience unexpected, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not completely surprising.
Germany had been a comfortable reserve for Securitate spies, Herta Müller had written in July, after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The people involved, one can assume, are speculative and in some cases probably knew what real name was hidden behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the now highly secure access to Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of the Securitate surveillance is still very vague.
The Commission has been able to provide a number of useful examples of the way in which the Community can help to improve the situation in the Third World.
A National Council for the Processing of Securities Files (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthler Authority was only established in 1999, but the issuance of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high was shown after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller in an interview in which a former Securitate head from Temesvar made derogatory comments about the laureate.
She's psychotic, after all, she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power was supposed to be expressed here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
The Commission has not yet decided on the procedure for the adoption of the directive.
The reasoning behind the audience's response to Solner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be driven by a thirst for knowledge rather than blame and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the rules for the application of this Regulation.
It was as if a well-dressed field worker had just come from a nice Christmas party where a sports goods manufacturer had been handing out goodies when the new VfB coach, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the equipment company, boarded a C-class for a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive baldness was driven to a city he did not know.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not involved, and drunk with luck, the 55-year-old was not.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we'll get back to work.
Or just start.
In the words of the Swiss who had only committed three days earlier: "We have reached the quarter-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight for relegation".
The "much more important task" is on Sunday.
Then we must repeat the King class performance in Mainz in the league's daily routine.
And the weaknesses that were revealed again after the quick three goals by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The draw for the quarter-finals of the Champions League (play-offs 16/17 + 23/24 February/reverse 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the thunderous entrance of Babbel's successor was tempered.
Not only the supposed savior, who had given the insecure Stuttgart professional in a short time self-confidence, willingness to work and play.
I went up to the players and told them to think about their strengths, and I urged them to be braver, explaining the simple-sounding recipe for success that had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when football gets a new impetus, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after weeks of injury, thanks to his dynamics, has become the best player on the pitch, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new manager works: "He is a man who is aggressive and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation".
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more than anything else, constancy.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful not to overestimate the victory against a weak and completely overwhelmed reserve defense of the Romanian guests.
They would have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0-4 the bad wake-up came, Khedira thought.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that while one goal has been reached, another is still far off.
We're not over the mountain yet.
Heldt was not in the mood to celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win for three months because of the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, broadcast just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership failure and decided to change coach under pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann also saw the fact that his day off after games had been cancelled as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure selfishness", Heldt retreated and announced consequences for the finalist.
I don't think they'll be friends for life, the two 40-year-olds.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that without the preparation work by the coaching team that was replaced, the playful and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big part in the success", Heldt and Lehmann said in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judges were unanimous.
- Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing champion of the world.
The 38-year-old champion according to the WBC version defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously in the night of Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense since his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already two times world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout everyone was expecting didn't work out.
Klitschko has 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02m Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left leading hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, kept avoiding the strokes of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not make his dangerous right decisively to the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, just trying to get through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he's only the second boxer since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to go the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some turmoil before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, while weighing, the champion was provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "so I could see his eyes".
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he had then beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
In his title defense, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
I only took one hit in this fight and I'm in very good physical shape, Klitschko explained the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the WBO and IBF World Champion.
The WBA belt is now held by David Haye, a Briton who succeeded in dethroning the 2.13-metre-tall Nikolai Valuyev in November.
Haye had earlier this summer canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Supposedly, his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
The opposition has launched a frontal attack: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar for giving false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest findings of the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has alleged a deliberate deception.
The Minister said "knowingly the untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news programme "Tagesschau".
It's called lying.
The order to kill was given in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States that have a high level of protection against the dangers of nuclear accidents.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only aimed at destroying the hijacked trucks, but also at targeting two Taliban leaders.
The US airstrike, requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, killed or wounded up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation report.
The Greens, SPD and Left called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately speak before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the German government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not have any influence on the concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were raised about the Ministry's statement on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the information of the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the background of the attack on the tanker.
Officially, they denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two top officials' circle said that they had even referred several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document from the commanding Colonel Klein and a fighter report.
Wichert is said to have written a letter asking for clarification, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer yet, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the investigation committee of the Bundestag, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
The dream worlds
Some people see images and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
It's not just the mentally ill and drug addicts who blur the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, it's okay.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are allowed to indulge in wildest imaginings and fantasies.
However, in the modern Western world, those who experience dreamlike states while awake, seeing and hearing things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered insane or drug addicted, at least as a freak.
But such images and voices are not limited to those who are mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the lines between dream, delusion, and reality.
Dreamy altered states of waking consciousness can take many forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusions.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic raptures, psychosis, and hallucinations can all be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the brain's neuronal messengers - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has intrigued philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dreaming in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great similarity of insanity with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all its inconsistencies, delusions, delusions of such".
It's the fall of 2001, and Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and crisp.
Gravity has no power over him, he's floating on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted fangs, gnashing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, malicious voices thunder from walls and radio.
He can't take it anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rips two wires from the stereo, knots them into a loop, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jump, now.
The noose is coming off.
Let this be a lesson to you, the voices in the drum-shredding choir shout, "go to the clinic and get cured!"
Henning T. is 40 years old today, he's had six acute psychosis episodes, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressive, taking medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
"In my psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair", he says.
The Illusions Are Cruel Realities
About one percent of the population will have schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, and in psychiatric hospitals it is the second most common disorder treated after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers often cannot distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, and they become hyperactive, which can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, delusions of relationship, or delusions of persecution.
Hearing voices - voices that command, comment, or dialogue - is especially common.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The sufferer is unable to separate important from unimportant, the brain is unable to filter out disturbing signals, the mind is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the floodgates to ideas and fantasies that originate in deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he becomes passive, as in a dream, overwhelmed by events and unable to actively shape them.
As a result, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
They are often unable to reconcile reality, the delusions are cruel reality, awakening is impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis is basically preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Why our brain does such a capricious thing is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional circumstances can cause any person to lose touch with reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers believe that the brain damage is minimal.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself for many years at first.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are running hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others spend money on drugs to get them, says Erich Kasten, a professor of psychology in Lübeck.
Whether delusions are pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he published his findings in the book The Unreal World in Our Mind.
Although hallucinations are a common symptom of psychosis, they are also a common symptom of many other disorders.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, says Kasten, are made up of memory contents that are usually withheld.
They occur when areas of the brain that process sensory perception are over- or under-activated, when our brains are running hot, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it's also a symptom of withdrawal, stress, heartbreak, or other mental disorders.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed reported experiencing hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the images and the voices.
During the break, a sloppy boy with long, dark hair may address it.
When he answers, the classmates look at him in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
You think the shy girl is a crazy daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
Often, the delusions are also a burden.
When she is in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher is introducing a new classmate to her eyes and ears while he explains mathematical equations audibly and visually on the blackboard to everyone else.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes far too seldom and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the freckles or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, are coming before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she shouts at the figures.
She won't tell her parents or friends, they'll think she's crazy.
It's the fall of 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from withdrawal, they are more likely to hallucinate after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is under-employed and is taking care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at age 13, she learned that the man she's called Dad since she can remember was not her biological father.
Because visual and auditory hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real-world impressions and sounds, sufferers like Sarah K. have difficulty distinguishing between delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, where reality is represented.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real".
Night vision is also valued by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
The borderline between dream and hallucination
In our world, which is too consciously centered, imaginary experiences are unfortunately often pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative traits - delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has been researching the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer believes to be real and that he cannot distinguish from the waking state even afterwards.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations due to trauma or disease, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and the world, such as by a persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
It's like a borderline between a dream and a hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is made present in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning and meaning-making in an inherently intolerable situation, which allows us humans our own capacity to design, not to sink into a void of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Switch" as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness is taken away after heart valve surgery and subsequent heart transplant, and he travels for days while his body is condemned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created himself, visiting strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs out of blood.
He's kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle back to his homeland, surfing the snow-covered Alps with his hospital bed, and meets a Korean mobster.
It's completely absorbed in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are still vivid to me years later, in subtle detail.
More vivid and intense than anything you've ever actually experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addiction show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even when awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that can be very enriching.

Children are to take over the publishing house at 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will remain 100% family owned.
- Hamburg publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children for the long term.
Both children inherit at 27 and have a strong desire to join the company, the 69-year-old told the Mirror.
We have arranged the details of this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
The question is whether they can do it.
You can't put your children in front of 7500 employees if they're not qualified.
It's killing the kids and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would step down as CEO in January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Management of Burda since 1999.
He was first in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury division, responsibility for corporate assets was added and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also for direct marketing, foreign trade, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is running the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
The name Kallen also serves to "bridge the gap between 10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should remain 100% family owned, Burda said.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from collapse either: "This was always about families who were infected by a capital addiction, who were completely speculative and thought they could become a very big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had "never had world power dreams", Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country like Springer was, and I don't want to play in the World League with Time, these stores have grown too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you desire in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of over 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is about body care.
The wellness area on the eighth floor is home to some of the most prestigious brands in the world, including Hedonai, which offers laser hair removal, Spaxión, which offers spaces for relaxation and beauty treatments, Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or, which has a fitness centre, and L'Occitane, which offers natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its teahouse with more than 130 different teas.
Having a relaxing massage with your partner and a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to have your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relaxing in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne are just some of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the clients' training sessions and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by typing a personal password on a touchscreen that is in front of the devices.
After that, there are various videos that show you how to do your training sessions correctly.

The most varied types of cleavage
Christmas is getting closer and closer, so it's another great opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their party dresses in our closet.
The shape of the cleavage, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decollete.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the 'LIVE-Office' together with the City of Barcelona.
The project is aimed at developing and promoting the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE-Office' (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements regarding mobility through management, coordination, subsidisation, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to gather opinions and measures from the sectors concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework contract is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
However, this is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the car sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts "a horizon of calm" for the Spanish automobile industry, which is the country's biggest exporter.
In presenting the 2009 economic report by the Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero reiterated the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would be facing a scenario of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants", the Prime Minister explained.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the carmakers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our biggest export sector", he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Automotive Overall Plan (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn generated investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government explained that these investments were intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Mr Zapatero also highlighted the government's measures to boost demand, referring to Plan 2000E, which is being implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan will reduce emissions by an average of 6% for new cars sold on the Spanish market, which in turn has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
On 20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Car Fair, an exhibition for professionals and motor enthusiasts, will be held in Madrid.
This fair will be held from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition will be held on an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres and will feature 200 exhibitors from the country and abroad.
Not only can you admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all the articles you can imagine related to the world of engines at ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors at the fair can be found with accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc.
Hundreds of items from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and enthusiasts.
The companies taking part in the fair include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of cars, specialising in Mercedes Benz.
The test shall be carried out in the open area.
In addition, sales activities at this fair are complemented by parallel events: meetings, sports car exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially equipped racetrack outside the exhibition area.
The Mazda3 i-Stop: environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop-and-start system, dubbed the i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation Mazda 3 stands out for its good overall ratings.
The finish, the vehicle's performance, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
The steering wheel is also excellent.
Further consideration of the instrument panel and dashboard unit shows that Mazda is in line with the Japanese trend towards futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking red and blue colors.
This style is partly reminiscent of the style of the Honda Civic.
It is therefore clear that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two compact Japanese cars offers more than ever the necessary comfort for four adults to ride in the car in the greatest comfort.
To all this comes a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is so far only available for the 150 hp 2-litre petrol engine with a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real treat, distinguished by its refinement, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this petrol engine i-Stop because of its great comfort in gear and its low consumption, even if Mazda's mainly diesel models are the best sellers.
In terms of equipment, the model Sporty selected for the test drive is a special one, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The standard equipment includes the Lane Change Assist (RVM) which eliminates blind spots, traction and stability controls, speed control, the light-sensitive rear-view mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and chrome-plated 17-inch wheels.
In addition, as if this were not enough, this version also includes the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional EUR 1.500: in addition to other elements, in particular the Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-loader.
The conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometres a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the luxury model and 23,270 euros for the trial-drive Sport model.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us new levels of driving pleasure every day.
A Glamorous Premiere
L.A. is rolling out the red carpet of sensuality for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, shone more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only lets you read your emails, without the ability to see certain attachments or browse the web.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is unlikely to be seen on the road, but the idea itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company launched two new devices: one that is only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, as opposed to Peek, which costs six times more.
The phonpeek, which was presented yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limitations as its American counterpart, but with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel the world with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up all the data to read your emails once you cross the border or when you're desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a way to connect to Fon).
The idea of roaming at flat rates is incredibly tempting and should have been possible a long time ago.
It is true that some telephone companies already offer special contracts and prices for foreign trips, but in my experience you need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming charges for Europe as a whole has almost always gone unheeded.
Outside your own country, you're always afraid of getting your e-mails read, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (which is surprisingly called Fon even though it doesn't have Wi-Fi) can offer these kinds of rates means that the phone companies have to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example, and its prices include downloading books and other requests from the Internet.
No hooks and no hooks.
It is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, when you buy it, not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase option with lifetime Internet access like the Peek already offers in the US.
And not because I want to buy it.
I'm reading my e-mails on the phone, thank you.
I am expecting this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle 's fetish color
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
When Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she wore a dress and a coat of this color, and she chose the same color again to accompany him to his, without a doubt, second most important moment in his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: apart from being almost the same color - a bright greenish yellow - the clothing consisted of three parts - a dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric - and she wore something roughly embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far as to suggest that the First Lady of the United States was following the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two garments differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and in Oslo, a patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: the first time, green shoes with half-high heels, and the second time, a similar model, but gold.
Her hairstyle was different every time: The hair was pulled up as a hairpiece on this occasion, while the previous time she wore it open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their maternity
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study on fertility and career development of women in Spain, carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women feel that their career prospects on the labour market are restricted by their maternity.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children depending on whether women work or not and, if so, what kind of work they do.
Those who do not work outside the home, work only part-time or have no fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with permanent jobs, especially in the public sector, postpone starting a family and becoming mothers and therefore have fewer children.
"Women aged 35-49 with a permanent job have their first child on average 3.7 years after moving in, a figure which rises to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have not had their move in and their first child until much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of pregnancy readiness", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor to be taken into account in the age of women at marriage and first child.
The survey shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which the couple marries and has their first child.
This difference was also observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the 35-49 age group, depending on whether they have only a high school diploma or higher education, became mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 or 32.1 years.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While women with a bachelor's degree get married and have their first child before they start their first permanent job, women with a high school diploma or higher do the opposite, first finding a permanent job and then getting married and having their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its coveted list of female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The lead actress of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, will become another famous poster child like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
The men's cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's co-star in "Lost").
The British Fashion Industry Awards
The British have a big say in the fashion world.
The highest representatives of the industry - fashion designers and models of yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all showed up for the occasion.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the top model of the year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) the thirty X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a similarity to the Creator's glowing heart.
The journey is exciting and Vicent is not without horrors and enlightenments.
Besides being a delightful read, this book is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "In reading his pages I found that the Mediterranean is not an ocean, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: Joy in contrast to fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote about what was in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunningly poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blades that almost killed him".
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was taken in by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, dermaβen, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege of getting to heaven by the way of perdition".
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey", published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, is one of the 8,000 peaks in world literature, one must climb the North Face, the face of the wall where the best climbers try again and again".
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny guy.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir of a county landowner, and other times he said he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were a sign of a certain greed".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the mad cry that was shouted from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that it would echo deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and said, 'My dear God, I beg you to do everything in your power to stop me writing like a woman.'"
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these lines by Spencer: 'The sleep after toil, / after the storm of the harbor, / the calm after war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death".
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
Her husband took it with perfect normalcy when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or the birds were singing in Greek.
There is no other known case where the man had so much patience and fell in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was far greater than her madness".
On Pío Baroja: "What was Martín-Santos doing but trying to get Joyce to go with Baroja?
What was Benet's intention in not getting Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but destroy that man's glory so he could put himself on this podium?"
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 ran up to her and our dog, a half-breed we got from the shelter that weighed just under six kilos, and then out of nowhere they kicked him twice and seriously injured him.
We cannot express our outrage in words, because we cannot understand why a cheap attack on a small and helpless animal, which was of course executed on a leash, should be so amusing.
And then there is the suffocation attack that a woman who was walking comfortably had when she tried to correct these people for the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may do the same to a wife, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even to anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint with a nearby police station, but we have serious doubts that this will ever work and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we would just like to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our outrage at what happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal amusing, an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial) to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, both companies announced today.
The initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is ultimately the only form of protection that can prevent head injuries and even death in a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which 'goes far beyond the design and manufacture of products that are becoming safer every day', and further stressed that it was also helping to move closer to this goal every day with other educational and information activities.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, which is run under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will initially distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible dissemination.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established whether the aid was necessary to ensure the continuity of the market.
Sales of light trucks rise again
After almost two years, the small van market is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% on 2008, and, even more important, the first increase in 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to figures from the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam.
However, these good figures should be used with caution at the moment, as the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly poor year with a 60% decrease in sales compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total sales of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all vehicles that make up the small van market: descendants of passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, vans and light trucks/chassis.
Moreover, the same storm clouds are still in the sky, which are the ones that are most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of the time buy with third party financing.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information provided by the Member States.
In this scenario, and unlike passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle under Plan 2000E has been of little help.
This scheme is not only for private individuals, but also for the self-employed and small businesses who wish to buy a small van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions limit of 160 grams per kilometre driven.
Just yesterday Ganvam had reminded that it is imperative that the state also pay special attention to these small lorries and, of course, industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Car Dealers predicts a similar year to last year for 2010, with a loss in sales (for passenger cars and SUVs) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as is now the case with the ESP stability control, the emergency braking systems must become a mandatory feature in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while a grace period has been set for the remaining vehicles until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's decision is intended to improve pedestrian protection, but these braking systems can also help prevent many accidents because of their operation.
The function of the emergency brake assist is to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects by the brake force applied by the driver on the brake pedal.
But this system does not exert that pressure to the end.
According to a study commissioned by the Bosch vehicle component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not brake with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake assist, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force into the braking system, reducing the braking time and thus the braking distance a car travels during braking.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
Even fewer accidents - one in four accidents with injuries is expected to be prevented - once so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
The vehicle is then fitted with a system that detects obstacles (by radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while applying a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning, even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant shall apply maximum pressure to the brakes to minimise the damage.
General Motors is pushing back Opel's plans to January.
While the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American carmaker is indicating that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to get the parties involved to agree to every point of the plan in advance.
And that's why it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, will be delayed until early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, has assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One such buyer could be Geely, which is also interested in acquiring Volvo, but the option of the Dutch maker of the Skyper sports cars, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining increasing traction.
If no agreement is reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
Using the Boxster S as a basis for their latest and most expensive jewel, the engineers actually managed to make it 80 pounds lighter, which now makes it only 1,275 pounds.
To achieve this, they first eliminated the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent-like roof with manual drive, saving 21 kilograms; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, like those of the GT3, another 15 kilograms were "disappeared"; the air conditioning system was removed, another 13 kilograms; the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, saving another 7 kilograms; the sporty bacquet seats were added, saving another 12 kilograms; and the light 19-inch wheels saved another five kilograms.
Then, by eliminating the CDR-30 audio system and replacing the door handles with cloth ones, the missing kilo was again reduced by six kilograms.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual clutch transmission, the test drive was done with a 6-speed manual transmission vehicle, mainly on the smaller California country lanes, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
His driving is a perfectly good one.
However, the reduction in weight has not made him less safe on the road.
It is quite the opposite: we have not tested a model so small and light for a long time, but which at the same time gives a feeling of great confidence in the corners, even at high speed.
He's a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a low gear in the time it takes until we give him the command to race, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again...
The car does everything we tell it to do with our hands on the wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A sound engine for all tastes
The sound of its 320 hp V6 boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and by a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time on the Panamera.
The acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing or re-accelerating.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the dirt roads we drove the Boxster Spyder on was already quite damaged, but the car handled the bumps well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route, even though we found ice at dawn and roll split in the morning on some of these corners.
In summary, it is an ultralight car, a car that gives you an indescribable driving pleasure, which is rarely seen in the past, and it is much more than just a small improvement on the Boxster SS.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70.831.
Bag girl'
The singer, a boobie of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stubbornness as her Chanel bags.
She's a lot more than a bad girl or an it girl. She's a bag girl.
Baskonia wins a victory for himself in Israel
Caja Laboral, despite the many exceptional players in Dusko Ivanovic's team, celebrated an outstanding victory with 82-91 on their visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes in first place in their group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to compensate for the significant losses of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great shots from the perimeter with 16 triplets scored contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the blue and red leading, who from the beginning took the lead on the scoreboard.
As the first four goals of the Vitoria team were already out of the perimeter, it was already obvious that they had come onto the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the Álava team opted for an inside play by Barac and for the play by Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause on his return to the team that is his home to continue to build their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though Splitter's "minus six" rating already suggested that this would not be the Brazilian's best night.
Despite the clear advantage at half-time, the game was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their pitch, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini were instrumental in turning the tide for the Yellows (50-49).
Further Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but far from dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air, and one of them was suddenly the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, ensured that a reassuring gap of (54-67) was shown on the scoreboard, which the hosts could embellish with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavés were beaten in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although Splitter was sent off for fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the front
Unicaja lost out loud in Greece to Olympiacos and had to cede the lead in Euroleague Group B to him, in a game marked by the failures of Unicajas players (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the home game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their performance in the first quarter, the Andalusians were able to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja incident, even though the home team managed to get the scoreboard to show 22-20 in their favour in the 13th minute with an inside game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis, the minute when an action almost led to a brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and both were disqualified.
The Greek team started to warm up and its superiority in both halves, while the retirement of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to injury and the three self-inflicted errors of Carlos Jiménez left a clear mark on Unicaja.
Among their midfield player and Lithuanian striker Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
Catching up was impossible.
The third quarter was characterised by many attacks against the Olympiakos team, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to equalize the difference of the match played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the lead within the group to wobble.
Unicaja tried to get over the many losses and the dismissal of the injured Scot Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many setbacks for Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to Cook's lead and three-pointers and Lewis's effort, there was some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was impossible, because the Olympiacos, once it attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket, could not be stopped.
Croatia's captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up and cede the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out what salary they should be earning based on their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most listings of real estate, jobs and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available on Trovit in Spain.
As early as a week after the application was first made available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "feels poorly paid", explains Trovit product manager Albert Ribera in a press release.
The Spanish are the lowest paid according to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer earns a gross annual salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, in contrast to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
The average annual net salary of a truck driver is therefore EUR 34.247 in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with a net annual income of 11,592 euros, followed by that of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-elect shall leave the diplomatic mission at the latest on 27 January 2010 when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade representative of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the embassy before that date, where he had sought asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, as his term of office expires on that day and he must find a new place to live".
The channel also quoted the former president as confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to seek asylum in Brazil this week.
This failed, however, because Zelaya refused to recognize the status of an asylum seeker politician that the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising at all, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt by direct asset purchases and to indirectly free up liquidity at zero interest rates, so that banks could buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct asset purchases are virtually complete and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to throw some sand in the sand, as the ECB has already done with its annual auction next week.
This is why investors are doubting the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are now witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premia.
Stock market volatility and corporate bonus spreads are rising again, although they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached earlier this year.
The governments were forced to nationalize private risks and the public debt is rising again.
The focus is now on quality again and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refugees for investors, which in turn increases the differences between the euro area countries in relation to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability until then, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened to downgrade Spain's rating again.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who once again tried to make those responsible for world economic policy aware of what they had done by slowing down the devastating effects of the credit cuts, which led to job losses, when they should have decided on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the emirates to restore power in the emirates and the development in Greece was also predicted earlier.
A government that hides the national debt, elections and a new government that pulls the same strings.
Prodi has done it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin is saving Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allowing a euro area country to default on its obligations.
It is logical, however, that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens when extraordinary measures are needed to maintain the stability of public funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, on the verge of an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt are increasing at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, if European disparities diminish and Spanish ones increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
While the country's favourable indicators are forcing most market research institutes to favour their recovery scenarios and to adjust their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are again coming up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise longevity despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that this is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "be careful when driving" is in order.

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the Parliamentary Subcommittee, where the strategy for Spain's energy supply over the next two decades is being debated.
After his speech, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some clues about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and a further EUR 60 billion from that date to 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Spanish authorities on the measures in question.
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and you should increase performance.
The Commission's proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, particularly on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, provided, of course, that other 'supporting sources' are used.
Galán, who believes that the sustainable economy bill just passed by the government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the exact opposite of all political strategies to fight climate change.
In his view, 'there is a clear longterm commitment to this, despite some 'individual' measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola described them.
In any case, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework to be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives handling from Aer Lingus at 10 airports
The Swiss airport subsidiary of Ferrovial, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage services at the 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been announced, is for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a cooperation protocol to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway in Australia
Acciona is fighting to get its first motorway licensed in Australia, a market where they are already present as energy and water companies.
The construction in question is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about $1.8 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and motorway operator in the country.
The city administration wants to have the construction completed by the end of 2014.
The administration has already received a final list of candidates for the construction and toll administration positions, having decided on a public-private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young.
Pending the bids presented in May, the estimated investment is A$1.7 billion (EUR 1.047 billion), with three consortia, mainly European, competing in the final phase.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, which is made up of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure, and the French construction group Bouygues, is competing against the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium, which is narrowly chosen, is called LBRJV, and is made up of the capital of Leighton of Australia (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn is owned by ACS), Baulderstone of the Netherlands (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and Razel of France, a company specialising in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction and privatization, but there is a hurdle to overcome, as the only way to get in is to buy a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to that market by owning a 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
million in assets
Acciona is focusing on this geographical area of major importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies contracted to build and operate the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The underground tollway, to be called Northern Link, will be funded by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and will link the Western Highway at Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass road over a 5 km tunnel, the largest ever undertaken to reduce congestion on Brisbane's roads.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award of the contract for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll road is already scheduled to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, construction is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government is contributing A$500 million (EUR 308 million) to the project.
Brisbane is big business for a deep sea.
Australia has repeatedly awarded major contracts to Hochtief, which signed a 154 million dollar contract with the government yesterday.
ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband fibre optic cable network through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide 400 000 people with fast Internet access and will provide 18 months of employment for the German company.
On the other hand, the company has been awarded the construction project for the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia, which has not yet begun and for which it has received a grant of 129 million.
In the UK, in Manchester, it is also competing with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools in 25 years.
The initial investment is EUR 75 million.
FCC receives contract for tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has contracted through its subsidiary Alpine for the construction of a 2.1 km tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia at a cost of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had been awarded the contract for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnelling.
Construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore gets a promotion from Renfe.
Renfe has contracted advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore's agency for a sum of about EUR 3 million a year, the railway company said.
Mrs Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies which had submitted their submissions to this competition, which was organised by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and manufacturing the campaigns.
France Télécom was fined 63 million for the slowdown of its competition.
France Télécom was fined EUR 63 million by the French competition authority for anti-competitive behaviour in its Caribbean territory.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty schemes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
In addition to this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was even increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary followed the example of other telephone operators and opened an application-based online shop to increase revenue from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We have to wait until 2010 for these Siete to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League match has brought Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has been a source of income for football clubs since it was established in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken in 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth highest-earning football clubs in the league.
Leading this list is Manchester United.
Leading this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the competition since its inception in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is the third most profitable club in Europe and the only one to have won the trophy three times, next to AC Milan.
The reigning Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is fifth.
Manchester United and Bayern Munich topped the list, two teams that also earned the most money from their participation in the last Champions League.
And that's despite losing to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the number of countries that have won money through the Championships, although it has more titles than any other country (five, as opposed to four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent contradiction is explained by the complicated funding system used by UEFA.
This financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects to generate revenues of 1.090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA has allocated 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the preliminary qualifiers (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a place in the competition received 3.8 million euros for their mere attendance, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team), with the clubs that reached the round of eight each receiving three million; the four that reached the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get four million each.
The winner gets $9 million, as opposed to the runner-up who gets $5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with its victory in the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, which amount to 337.8 million.
This money will be allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first to be awarded four places.
The last year's champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% of the fourth place.
The other half will be distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers $61 million for a 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details yesterday of an offer to buy shares with a cap of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which, because of the number of shares, does not oblige them to make an open tender (OPA).
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, to be paid over 10 years and at an interest rate of 1% per annum as a result of this shift.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at $1.85, so Nueva Rumasa is valuing the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jeréz group gives shareholders 15 days to notify their interest in selling their shares.
The CNMV stated that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of potential buyout offers and the legal wrangling of his former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position at the food company.
This is a newly created post reporting directly to the group chairman.
This is far from free of controversy, because the company is embroiled in a legal battle over alleged diversion of more than 230 million of Sos to other Salazar family companies.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will shift further capital over the next few months.
In the matter of the Salazar loan, yesterday the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing its destination.
CNMV approves the exclusive tender for Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Commission of the Stock Exchange (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The Authority stated that it approved this tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions complied with the applicable laws and that the content of the explanatory memorandum submitted could therefore be considered 'sufficient', following the amendments of 2 December last.
CNMV also stated that this offer was for the purchase of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, which in turn represents 8,95% of the share capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares listed on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares had been fixed, which could not be transferred until the tender was closed, and whose price had been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law in force.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops are making money
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in accidents are taken to repair shops, where an expert must assess the damage and repair costs.
No accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and man-hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000 per hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
This is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Service and application providers for accident assessment and repair shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers, process it and provide it to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader, with 80% of all opinions being generated with its products.
The other two companies competing on the market for assessment and reporting tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The data provided by manufacturers is not easy to work with.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's sales manager, 63 manufacturers and importers are involved, each providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the volume of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been put on the market in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work for the companies begins.
It is a laborious task, because each of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catalogued and its price entered.
In addition, each model is created as an "intelligent" graphic image on which different parts of the vehicle can be "clicked".
If the model is a bestseller, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the information provided by Audatex is accurate and that the information is used in a timely manner.
For example, for the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the number of vehicles on the roads, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for the purpose of documentation and database production, each of which is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
They're recording 2.5 million data every month, and their customers get updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is for repair and overhaul, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the break-even or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that tells you the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this service in Spain, but in the United States.
A look at the products offered by Audatex will give you an easy overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
The company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard accident assessment solution for accident assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the manufacturer's estimated repair times or paint prices.
This tool is paid for according to its purpose, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive is for customers who use it rarely, up to ten times a month, i.e. €5.75 a month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow a vehicle and the equipment with which it was run off the assembly line to be fully identified by the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with windscreen and AudaSubastas is an internet service open to the specialist market for vehicles declared to be in total damage.
Their statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information on variations by make and model.
For example, it can be used to determine how many models of a particular car have had to be repaired due to breakdowns or how many have been involved in a serious accident in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It also distributes Gt Estimates, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide to Reviews is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 it had a turnover of EUR 10,8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they started to expand into the international market by opening an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The total worldwide turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is USD 557 million, an increase of 3,35 over 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market and today its shares are trading at $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Auction of accident vehicles on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group acquired an Internet platform for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase involved the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value added, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealers, who must register before starting their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website now has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish legislation, a vehicle with a vehicle registration number can no longer be driven on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts can be used as spare parts.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the new rules.
The cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a quote in just four steps:identifying the vehicle, finding the spare part, and creating and producing a quote.
The ease of use of these systems is a basic condition, above all to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer technologies.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
After identifying the model to be repaired by means of the chassis number, a graphic of the model in question appears and the spare part required is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for hours worked, surcharges or discounts and then have the estimate printed and passed on to his customers.
AudaTaller is not, however, an assessment tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
The company Audatex is currently working on the possibility of offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because you can use it to select a door and then turn the image completely around to look inside.
