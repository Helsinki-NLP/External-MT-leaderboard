A chorus of Persian men, wearing long, tan-colored skirts and white button-down shirts, opens the proceedings.
They are in their capital city anxiously waiting for news of their king, Xerxes, who is off duking it out with Athens.

Koniordou, who is among Greece's greatest stage actresses, knows the role inside out - she directed and starred in an earlier National Theater of Greece production of "The Persians" that played New York City Center in 2006 - and she anchors the proceedings without seemingly doing much at all.

"I think it has probably missed the mark where all the people who call us, call in the expectation they can get very cheap funding rather than the government backing 50 per cent of the loan", he said.
"So they call and they get very disappointed because the expectation has been put out there that there is discount pricing and we look at our cost of funding which has not changed at all".
Mr Callaghan added if fintechs were able to access cheaper funding and pass that on to small businesses the scheme would be a "no brainer".

Melbourne-based Moula is also participating in the scheme and chief executive Aris Allegos said the benefit of the 50 percent guarantee, implicit in the government scheme, should be passed on to small businesses but different lenders were handling this in different ways.
"I can understand there might be others who are not passing through that cost structure", he said.
"e might be a function of how their funding is structured and it might be a function also of which categories they are lending into and how they assess risk within those categories".

Mayor Quinton Lucas of Kansas City questioned on Sunday President Trump's motives for sending federal agents into U.S. cities - saying that while he would welcome the help in solving a a of murders in the Midwestern city, he thinks the move could be more about boosting Trump reelection chances.
"I was pretty frustrated this week [that] the president mentioned the George Floyd protests, mentioned the Black Lives Matter movement", Lucas, a Democrat, said on "Fox News Sunday" of the recent protests over racial inequality and police brutality.

Lucas added: "Let's try to have a pinpointed and targeted focus on solving murders... I think if you listen to recent statements... we are happy to work with federal agents in a limited scope".
Despite his willingness to have federal agents work with local law enforcement, Lucas said that Trump's rhetoric - specifically in light of the controversy surrounding the tactics employed in Portland, Ore., by the federal agents - has caused many of his constituents to voice concern about the presence of agents on the city streets.
What we don't need is more fuel on the fire from federal agents to make, I think, an exciting political issue, he said.

While sending federal agents to aid local law enforcement is not unprecedented - Attorney General Bill Barr announced a similar surge effort in December for seven cities that had seen spiking violence - the type of federal agent being sent, and some of their tactics, have raised concerns among state and local lawmakers.

Portland has been hit with almost-daily demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism since the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.
Local authorities have also complained that the surges have only exacerbated tensions, and criminal justice experts say the efforts defy explanation because of the unprecedented moment America is living through - with a pandemic, historic unemployment and a mass reckoning over racism and how people of color are treated by police.

Tension has been heightened at recent protests against racial injustice since federal officials were sent to quell demonstrations in Portland, Oregon.
Police declared a riot in Seattle on Saturday.
Protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota who died after a white officer held him to the ground with a knee to his neck, have also highlighted other cases of fatal police violence.
