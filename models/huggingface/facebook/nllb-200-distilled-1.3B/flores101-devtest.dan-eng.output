While an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the death rate from Ebola, no drugs have so far been shown to be effective in treating an existing infection.
The antibody mixture ZMapp initially showed promise in this area, but formal studies indicated that it was less effective than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was the control, meaning that the researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee, and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's opinion that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally can't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown at the top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a featherbed, but have other features of feathers - rays and breeches - the researchers concluded that feathers were likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or decoration.
Scientists believe that the tail sample from the young dinosaur shows the plumage of an adult individual and not a chicken duck.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the wounded were police officers.
Police said they suspected a suspected Daesh supporter of being responsible for the attack.
They found that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was determined by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic rotations.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the SagDEG galaxy.
The scientists could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and is made up of lots of tiny particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the power plant.
Residents near the plant were warned by local authorities to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning, and avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very concerning and there was cause for alarm because of its very high mortality".
Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total TB population still seems low, 6,000 of the 330,000 infected in South Africa at any given time.

During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
"Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, said: 'Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as steadily as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature around the clock.'"
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and place a printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once the identity of the voter has been verified by the officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
The procedure is codified very precisely in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can see that there are no ballots in the ballot box at the start of the vote and that no ballots are added other than those correctly recorded and from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process.

This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of images to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful when publishing images of suspects and the like".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders of before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is said to be sacred to both countries, and the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trial were to be closely monitored by park officers as the trial was monitored and its impact evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, faulty iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "quite regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency announced that there were no reports of damage in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages including children and elderly were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who was going to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons, quite exceptional, like herself, strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as I was... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the various extremes of the vote, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have raised doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication necessary to combat his pain, as it is forbidden during the games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, and especially how the earth formed after comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
There's a lot of speculation about whether he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be introduced and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
The fear of not having transportation raised the possibility that you would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process would have taken much longer because of mating between the endemic Darwin's finch geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes.
It can be stretched out into a thin cable that can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using kale juice.
The juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Brinations are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The villages of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every home.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket that's over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it has done for us is it has given us much easier and faster modes of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including loose domestic cats) eat the far more numerous small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs react much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete, able to climb (but not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of snarling, shouting words.
Ozelotes prefer small animals, and they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can, but almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find prey by scent, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and are very quiet about their movements.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, and it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants make oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a septic.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was inhabited by few people, and in Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living in the area at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although it says something on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the comment was simply attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, substantial group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and it also defines in some way the size of society.
A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government  with Congress as the sole component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, they were dependent on government authorities, which were often uncooperative in enforcing all actions.
Nor did it have the right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous acceptance by all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team is, along with Germany's national football team, the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to from a geographical point of view as an "island group"
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors named it Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island, as they passed by.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which began a change in the original grain production practices, employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which may seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much misused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective location for the main motif is at the intersection of lines dividing the picture into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was examined.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European nations despite their different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from kings to common citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was properly lived out.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching the area.
Britain planted mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, most citizens and nations were inclined toward pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a collection of poetry and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese period or dynasty that was in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most well-known of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to occupy the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same is true of the military, because instead of ranking by class in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life, and he used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on Mount Noor (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists.
Only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains are visible, and very little of the outside world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the world-famous Great Pyramid being the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up-arch' mark looks like a V and the 'down-arch' mark looks like a stapler, or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes usually produce a softer sound, while downstrokes sound louder and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the marked markings are for musical reasons and should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie Therese and four years old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a band of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their chariot wide open.
At one point, a member of the Mafia showed the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for most of the expenses, and bond yields ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period of time in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human fate is driven by an underlying logic, which is related to scientific laws and the way they are realized in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on societies that is heritable and not socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The increased number of cars also increases the number of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical techniques to heal injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography developed, which were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to have been an epicenter of luxury since about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because Crusaders had returned with gifts of silk and spices that were of greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most widespread in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily inspired by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characteristic because of the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that govern a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of several factors.
People belonging to a subculture often signal their belonging through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children through failure, accident or deliberate neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Some wild children have been deprived of their liberty by humans (often their own parents); in some cases, this child failure was caused by the parents' rejection of a child with severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, platforming goes a step further.
The training is not a learning method but a support for people who need to learn something new - for example, to use a new computer program or start a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual platforms are internalised in the software and are intended to question, ask for and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, but they do so nonetheless.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family's job is to provide all the necessities that were not available in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that 'learning' and 'socialization' are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in pets such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added by mutation and removed from the pool of exact variations by selection".
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of man to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are hard to digest unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without completely waking you.
If you find yourself turning off your watch while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, forcing one to get up and leave the water.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is the exact opposite of the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and all people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
The basic tenets of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, comprising Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy is brought to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through which the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightenment consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought seriously by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods while also affecting your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which used mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are known to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Husebirds were generally kept in herds that walked on hills or other pastures, often supervised by goatherds, often children or teenagers, who were the equivalent of the more common shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although the carriageways were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull heavier loads faster than on the more uneven roads of the day.
The spokes were invented early on to hold the tracks in place, but it was eventually realized that tracks would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The first known mode of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
There are bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological progress, and problems have been increased by overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Speaker John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his soldiers in New York on July 9, and delivered to London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
There are many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term comes from an ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that live largely as parasites on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nidiculous, which means that they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interests or that of their child.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take them over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by means of the scientific method, which is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue a period of free-flowing cycles even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA in the beak with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the beak with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape and the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching and park visits, and studies of ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where people leave small villages in their cars to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they just left.
On this dynamic ferry, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonised economy has freed the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport system.
In developed lands, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is aware of the fact that the Commission is not in a position to take any action to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings into the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the sunfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
His theory was divided - some believed that he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because we can't feel the Earth spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on earth, containing over eight times as much water as the second largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, reaching up to six miles (9.6 km) in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City State, with a population of about 800, is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most government workers, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they occur in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for with the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is a basic mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is used less and less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now text through computer screens and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, but when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down under little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It's thinner under the marsh and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more lunar gardens on the front, since the crust here is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around figuring out what makes people respond, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
Theories investigate what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions, and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or not perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise when a manager starts to lead his former colleagues.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, performing performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations of expertise are placed on virtual teams as on conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are used efficiently across the functional departments of an organisation.
As a result, the process in an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that fosters innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, so it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models with that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although often associated with science fiction, artificial intelligence is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to make machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, as it has been incorporated into several home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of every classroom, and quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
Technology offers virtual excursions, allowing students to view museum artifacts, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good method to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are still online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally smooths this out.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to work on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become smarter about the world around them". The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All these things and more make Ontario what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
Further north, there are large areas that are sparsely populated, some of them almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route between Europe and India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is wise to wear what may look like a wedding ring (it should not look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a variety of nips, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Despite Goma being reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
This, coupled with the city's relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It can also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, since this gives access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists consider as the primary focus area.
The skyline of Hong Kong is a group of buildings that, reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering column diagram,
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon harbor front on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development is tightly packed into reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonizers made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 50 miles (80 km) from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps  they include some of the last remaining vegetation of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3.850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/moist areas.
Sundarbans has been a game reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 chital deer now live in the area.
Buses run from the interregional bus station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable and robust Japanese buses.
Deletaxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important group of indigenous people in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "the great province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams in the world as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets, contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed at the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted inside Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be used in the outlying islands, although British and American currencies may be available; ask the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures are usually above 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, you have to stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack easily.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops by the sea.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It is certainly safe to drink the local tap water, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called an "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of the authorities, read and follow signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea otters are found near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservation gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers on specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport or even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and many attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, get in early to get a tent near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you're crossing the Baltic Sea in the winter, as navigating through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms), which is nice to know, as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and in their homes.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered on the house, but drunkenness weakens judgment, and all true gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On icy and slippery roads, there is little friction, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short time, enough snow can fall to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling snow or wind or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic is generally smooth year-round.
Safari is the highlight of many and perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land trips to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment is sufficient to see the animals.
Lions, leopards, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A bush safari (also called a bush walk, walking safari, or walking safari) consists of hikes that take either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having also hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow even if there is not one in your room.
If you cannot afford an iron or do not like wearing socks that are ironed, try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they do not know from home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch from Point Marion to Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated backcountry terrain.
Be careful if you are not used to driving on country roads: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns abound.
The speed limits are remarkably lower than on stretches before and after  typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is even more important than usual to observe them exactly.
Strangely, mobile phone coverage is much stronger here than on many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, as in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked in cakes year-round, and cherries and flowers make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you fancy some small but full cakes, try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a broad term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, when used without further elaboration, the term typically refers to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a number of single-spiced dishes, with the most popular spices being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Ladder suspenders are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety problems because of the possibility of a rider's feet becoming stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot caught in the rope, he may be pulled along if the horse runs away.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety harnesses that allow the harness to come loose from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks present breathtaking views from the summits for all visitors, and climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amid its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve running down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski buffs" - planning their entire vacation around skiing in a certain area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 B.C.E. show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skies: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the ski run as if it were a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you walked  but you will only very rarely get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, a trip through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique goods, and some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami with other occupations.
Traditionally, not all Sami people kept reindeer in large numbers, but they lived off fishing, hunting, and other activities.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trades.

When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first traveled to a foreign land, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler to a completely new land needs to adjust.
People may not expect patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.

In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
One option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a sabbatical year is travel and learning.
This is particularly popular among school leavers as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their education.

Finland is a great destination for sailors. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the islets along the coast.
In the islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, a smaller boat or even a kayak is a different experience.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is a bit like Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number one is forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days, where you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.

The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a lot of money toward getting the opportunity (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay big money for the privilege of getting there quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, where the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
These can be borrowed from the storage room at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel completely comfortable wearing these skirts.
