Members of the Welsh Assembly are alarmed by the resemblance to the muppets.
Some members of the Assembly are seriously concerned about the proposal to change their current title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue arose because the Assembly is to be renamed the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political factions complain that they may be targeted.
One Labour MP says his group regrets the split between the Twp and the Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means clever and pwp means cheat.
And a member of the assembly from the Plymouth Party said that his team was not happy and came up with some alternative names.
Welsh Conservatives said they were "conceited" by the new name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very similar to Muppet (the British puppet TV series).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently working on a bill to introduce a new name, says: "The final decision on any interpretation of the name of the members of the Assembly, of course, is made by the members themselves".
The Welsh Assembly was given the power to change its name by a 2017 decision of the Welsh Government.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public review of options, where it won widespread support for a proposal to name the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the rank of Assembly Member, the Commission chose the name Member of the Parliament of Wales, or WPM, but the MWP option gained more support in public debate.
Members of the Assembly are still choosing alternatives, so reaching consensus will be a concern for Speaker Ellen John, who is expected to introduce the amendment bill in a few weeks.
The reform bill also includes other changes to the workings of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the scheme of the committee system.
The final decision on the name will be made by the members of the Assembly during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians hold referendum on changing the country's name
Voters on Sunday will decide whether to adopt the country's new name, the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was called in response to decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor by that name claims its territories and has consistently opposed its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, says he will not pay attention to the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a cost of joining the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church were silenced because the churches in Harlem were in trouble.
"Thousands of people I spoke to said that historically every neighborhood had a bar and a church", said Mr. Adams.
Today, none of them are.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are interacting differently now", he said.
The bars are no longer the meeting places of the troubled, where the neighbors used to go all the time.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders predict, and sooner or later they will be back where they started.
Churches could be replaced by co-operative housing, where people would live who would not take care of the remaining temples in the neighborhood, he added.
"The owners of these co-operative buildings will be mostly white", he said, "so they'll rush the day when all these churches are closed, because the people who move into these co-operative buildings won't become parishioners of those churches".
Both churches were built by white parishioners before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Municipal Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's - decades later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved here in the 1930s.
The local black congregation obtained the building permit.
St. Martin's Church was founded by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the main shopping district of Harlem, 125th Street, against merchants who refused to hire and encourage black people to work.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but because of a reconstruction plan developed by Father Johnson's parish, the bells were rung.
St. David Johnson, the son and heir of Father Johnson, proudly called this carillon the "Record of the People's Call".
In July, Carillion's performer expert called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the carillon played by Dionysio A. Lind, the world's first black musician, who moved to the more common carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said that St. Martin's Church hadn't changed it.
In recent months, what has been done at St. Martin's has been a complex design by architects and contractors, partly brought in by the church's chaplain assistants, the rest by the bishop's parish.
The parish council - the governing body of the parish of the church, which consists of chaplain assistants - wrote to the parish in July complaining that the parish was being forced to pass the expenses to the parish council, even though the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the parish.
Zwingen caught a 13-year-old cyclone collector in California.
According to official reports, on Saturday, the opening day of California's tornado season, Zwingli attacked a 13-year-old boy who was digging for tornadoes.
The attack occurred at about 7 a.m. in Encinitas, near Shukuras Beach.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that after a half hour of snow on Saturday morning, he heard the boy scream for help and he and his friends rushed to help him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was a cries of excitement about the cyclone, but then he realized that it was a mikina!
I'm going to get a new one.
"When I got closer, I saw that the swan was completely untied", said Hamel.
"I was shouting, 'There's sulfur in the water!' " Hamel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rade Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was critically evaluated.
It is not known what type of swallow was the attacker.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a few weeks ago, a seagull had been spotted in the area, but he said that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim has traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Police have banned the beaches from Punto Beach in Casablanca to Swamy Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of snails in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's is planning to take over the UK cosmetics market.
Sainsbury's offers cosmetics delivered through supermarket shelves and specialist help, unlike Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
The £2.8 billion cosmetics market is still growing, while sales of clothing and household products are down, and the main distinguishing feature of the market attack is that cosmetics delivered on supermarket-like shelves will be tested in 11 major stores across the country and, if successful, in more stores next year.
There's an investment in cosmetics, because supermarkets are hunting for shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's says it will double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 names, and for the first time will include brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will become even more diverse in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is re-launching its boutique makeup product, which is free of animal products and is vegan-friendly, with demand for such products among younger consumers rapidly increasing.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will be piloted at two Sainsbury's markets, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open later this year in Sale Oak, Birmingham.
The trend towards online shopping and the daily shift to buying a few small groceries in nearby stores is forcing supermarket owners to work harder to attract visitors.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, says outlets will be very much like universes, as supermarket chains try to compete with frequent discount Aldi and Lidl by offering more service and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of supermarkets, and has developed a number of Habitats since acquiring both chains two years ago, improving food sales and making purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tried to jointly operate with Boots, but could not agree on how to split the proceeds from its supermarket pharmacies.
Sainsbury's launched its new strategy three years ago with the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
Lloyds is to play a role in this plan by expanding into four markets with such high-end skincare brands as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer at Sainsbury's, says: "We've changed the way we shop, and we've brought the consumer a stack of cosmetics.
There are also specially trained personnel who are ready to help.
Our brand portfolio meets all requirements, and our attractive environment and convenient location makes old-fashioned shopping a serious competitor.
Peter Jones is angry that his £11 million contract with Holly Willoughby has been terminated.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den was shocked by the behaviour of TV presenter Holly Willaby when Holly terminated his £11 million lifestyle brand business contract to focus on his new ventures with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willaby has no time for their brand of clothing and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business was linked to Pelthro's brand Goop.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Peter Jones of Holly Willoughby's Dragons' Den made sense when he left the lucrative business of their lifestyle brand at the last minute to devote all his time to a new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
A source said Jones was "outraged" when the TV golden girl announced at a tense meeting at the Mallow headquarters of her business empire in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that her new £1.5 million contract would leave no time to return to their underwear and accessories brand Truly.
The business was linked to the late Peter's brand Goop and hoped to double Willoughby's £11 million deal.
When 37-year-old Willaub announced via Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK for one of his summer villas.
Sources say that "Truly" was Hall's top priority.
This was his long-term business, which he would be busy with for the next few decades.
His decision to quit was a complete disgrace to everyone involved.
No one could figure out what happened on Saturday, because it was so close to the beginning.
The Malos headquarters are full of ready-made goods for sale".
Experts estimate that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's highest-paid celebrities, will cost the company millions, as solid investments have been made in everything from pillows and candles to clothes and pajamas, and the likely delay of their release.
Besides, it would be the end of a long friendship.
Willaby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willaub started with Truly Cap in 2016, and in March Jones, 52, joined them as chairman.
In addition to the couples' holiday spending together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlen as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we're not going to comment on his business dealings.
"I was so happy to see you, and I was so happy to see you", she said.
He joked that the news media criticized him, some of whom considered it a non-presidential comment and also disliked his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump wearing so much?
Trump said in a voice that mimicked a TV host.
I'm not giving you anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which was arranged by Trump to make a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have failed.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see a response from the United States to the disarmament efforts launched in North Korea on Tuesday.
Instead, he added, the United States is continuing sanctions designed to maintain tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his closing remarks.
"Our business with North Korea is going very well", he said.
War with North Korea was imminent.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending missile tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remaining American services home.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"Presidential behavior is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into the stadium, we have 200 people right here", Trump said, pointing directly to the crowd in front of them.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds
In order to assess the effects of the Lompoc earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"They have often been very clear that they are not seeking international help, which is a little bit troubling", Ms. Sumbun said.
While Save the Children is already preparing a team to travel to Palouse, it is not yet clear if foreign staff will be working on the site.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian government agencies are evaluating the situation in Palo, to determine whether to allow international agencies to provide relief.
If we consider the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, we can say that the country is fully prepared for natural disasters.
And in Taza, you've got tsunami shelters, but you don't see that in other areas.
It turns out that the absence of a tsunami warning in Palo, despite the fact that it was known, was one of the reasons for the high death toll.
Moving between many of the islands of Indonesia, even in good weather, is quite difficult.
Natural disasters make transportation even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was stranded in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palouse, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has focused on improving Indonesia's decaying infrastructure and has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is hampered by funding problems because he has a re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also has a problem with interfaith conflict in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are followers of the most conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes in street clashes between Christians and Muslims using machetes, handguns and other weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturgeon has hit a high ball into the Chelsea goal
Daniel Sturge saved the Premier League defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday with an 89th-minute goal.
Sturge received a call from Harden Shakire about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team went 1-0.
He passed the ball on his left foot before hitting a distant son.
The high-stroke went over the top of the penalty and landed in the top right corner of the hedge.
Finally, the ball fell from the top of the overturned Cape Arizaballaga into the mud.
"It was just trying to get in position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always push as far as they can, so I was just trying to have as much time as I could", Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the canteen coming and I played with one touch, didn't think much, so I hit it.
Chelsea won 1-0 in the 25th minute of the first half with a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues' striker then returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic with a hat before sending it from the centre of the field to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic took it in the middle of the field and quickly hit the wall.
Then he made a beautifully cut transmission, which got Asar to go to jail.
Asard evaded the defense and the left foot hit a long shot into the doorway of Liverpool's Alison Baker.
On Tuesday at 3pm, Liverpool will play the group stage of the Champions League in Naples at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are playing the UEFA Europa League on Friday at 3pm in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The National Disaster Management Office reported that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832 on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit on Friday, causing waves as high as 20 feet, the ministry's press secretary Sutopo Purvo said at a press conference.
The city of Palo, which once had 380,000 inhabitants, is in ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of premeditated murder who stabbed a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found fatally wounded on John Street Grayson Mews at 7:55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling residents of nearby areas who have seen or heard anything about the case.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would ask anyone in the John Street area of Birkenhead to contact us if they see or hear anything suspicious.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on the video recorder to contact us, as this information could prove vital to the investigation.'
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was local and was found in a residential house.
In the morning, friends who knew the deceased woman came to the scene to ask where she had been found this morning.
An investigation is underway, police said, and they are trying to inform the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver in Grayson, Missouri, recently tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He couldn't say anything when he heard what had happened.
Residents were told that the investigation would take several hours before they were allowed back into the building.
A police officer told one man that this whole area is now considered a crime zone.
There was a woman who was crying.
He kept saying, 'How awful.'
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the line, and another was outside.
Several officers were watching the residential areas from within the boundary line.
Anyone with any information please call DM @MerPolCC on 101 or contact the Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference to the 247 recording of September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest monumental hit in a string of re-writes of history.
His depiction is a graphic punishment for the Taliban's invasion and destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in England by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's proposal "nonsense" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the recent debate over the dissolution of the monasteries, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be the target".
The fight against traditional belief in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps another Cromwell is being punished for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Thornycroft's masterpiece is a fine testament to the 19th-century attitude toward Cromwell and is part of the historiography of a person who is considered by many to be worthy of appreciation today.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Maybe more in the second half of the 19th century than today, but still, Cromwell is seen by many as the protector of Parliament from outside pressure when attacked by the monarch.
The historical debate about how accurate this representation is still ongoing.
One thing that can be said for sure is that in the 17th century, the conflict gave impetus to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell was an important representative of one of the parties to this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and honored.
The killer worm stabbed a Chinese farmer to death
In southwest China, a pig has struck and killed a farmer at a market, local media reports.
A man with a blood-stained artery, identified only by his surname Xuan, was found dead in a pig market near a pig station in the southern Chinese province of Jiangsu's Liupanshuang village on Sunday morning.
A pig prepares vaccines for slaughter in the wild in the village of Xinyin, in the province of Xizhai, China, on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he reportedly went to the market with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and noticed that the door to the nearby pig station was open.
He said there was a big pig in the station with blood on it.
The coroner confirmed that a 550-pound rooster had stung and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and stained", said the cousin, who was referred to in the Guiyang Evening News article as Zhou.
Security camera footage shows the yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on a Friday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan doesn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up in a separate box to prevent further attacks while police gathered material at the scene.
It is reported that negotiations are underway between Yuan's family members and market leaders over compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, pig attacks on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man severely injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound Welsh farmer's horse crashed into his tractor, until his frightened wife threw it away.
When an Oregon farmer ate a pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not generally aggressive, but the taste of blood can give them a boost.
They're just playing.
Their chicks are very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with enough respect", he said.
Hurricane Rosa is followed by widespread heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
It is predicted that Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it approaches the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be followed by flood-causing rains in the coming days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa reached a speed of 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m., a Category 1 storm, on Sunday at 5 a.m. eastern time, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to move north.
Meanwhile, a storm buildup is beginning in the Pacific Ocean and it is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa Bay approaches the California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, heavy tropical moisture will follow northward in the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to some areas of Mexico.
Then, in the next few days, tropical moisture will interact with the nearby ridge to create large-scale downpours in the southwest.
In places, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause sudden landslides, avalanches, and possibly even hailstorms in desert areas.
Heavy tropical moisture causes rainfall to rise by up to 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in the southwest, especially in most areas of Arizona.
Unexpected waterfalls can quickly deteriorate due to the mixed nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be particularly unwise to go outside and walk in the open in a situation where there is a threat of heavy tropical rains.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and the mud and muds can be followed by strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching storm will bring flash floods to parts of the Southern California coast.
The total amount of precipitation can be half an inch, which causes small clouds and road bumps.
This will be the first heavy rainfall in the region during the monsoon season.
The storm is expected to make landfall in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and will become more widespread on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to hit Four Corners on Tuesday and continue throughout the day.
In October, frequent temperature fluctuations are expected in the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes a sharp temperature difference in nearby areas.
An example of a dramatic change in temperature will be in the central United States this week.
Temperatures will be 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining heat of summer will continue to intensify and expand.
The central and eastern regions of the United States will witness a mild start to October, extending from 80 degrees south of the Plains to some areas of the Northeast.
New York City's temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast for the first half of October shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people watched the interview with Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched the moving demonstration Friday at the Supreme Court by candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blaze Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, as the political confrontation continued, broadcasters suspended their programming for a last-minute change on Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was getting drunk and trying to wash his clothes at the senior prom.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional statement, said he was 100 percent sure that it hadn't happened.
It appears that more than 20.4 million people watched it, according to a Nielsen report released on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
There was no data available at the time from other networks that also broadcast this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And also, Nielsen usually has a hard time figuring out how many people are watching in their offices.
In objective terms, that's the number of people who watch a football playoff or an Academy Award ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose pundits have been overwhelmingly in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination, leads the way among other channels with an average of 5.69 million viewers a day, Nielsen said.
ABC's score was 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After hearing the news, the interest remained high.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After moderation, the Republican press office officially announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, as CNN and CBS cameras captured him Friday morning as opponents shouted at him for trying to get into the elevator for the legal committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes closed for a few minutes while he was being argued about, as seen live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power when so many women are weak".
Flake said his office issued a statement saying he could have said more before the elevator was closed to hear the committee.
Cable and broadcast networks were live in a few hours when the legal committee was to pass the ballot to pass Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's entire ballot.
But Flake said I'd only do that if I knew the FBI was going to investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which the Democrats were going to be in the minority.
Flake was partly convinced when he spoke to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of playing politics.
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics and ignoring national interests over Britain's future.
British Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
While his interview was on the front page, a second interview appeared on the sidebar, in which his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke out against his so-called Brexit checkered plan, saying that the goal of the UK and the EU collecting each other's tariffs was completely absurd.
Wade Sims Shot: Police arrest suspect in the murder of LSU player
Police have arrested 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims on suspicion of murder by lethal injection.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and is in custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson confronting each other, and police said Sims lost in a glass fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene, and CBS affiliate WAFB reports that Simpson's DNA was found on them.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wade by accident.
His financial obligation was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, specifically to Keyser.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Crime Detection Team, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department, and the citizens of the district for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the assailant.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the regional law enforcement for their "consistent and thorough investigation".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
Wade said, "I'm always nervous about this".
The volcano's fur reached Mexico City
The eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, after activity reached the crater and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded in 24 hours, the National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano.
The center has detected a number of rumblings and rumblings.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of paint on the carpet of a mine in the Hoshimilko district of Meiko City.
Geophysicists have been focusing on the increased activity of the volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyos has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and law enforcement, as thousands joined a protest to mark the first anniversary of the polarized referendum on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatist supporters were detained by law enforcement officers, who fired at them with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes with the police happened on the same day that the police used the handcuffs.
For several hours, the independence supporters chanted "Forget, Forgive", followed by the protestors for unity shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were found to be suffering from minor injuries sustained during the protest, local media reported.
One year after Madrid's unlawful referendum on October 1, tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region as Catalan separatists celebrate the anniversary.
Many people voted for independence, but more opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
Catalan officials say about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to disrupt the referendum and clashes broke out at polling stations in the region.
Pro-independence groups staged a night of protests on Friday to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The ongoing demonstration was forced to continue on another route.
Narcisse Thermes, 68, an electrician, participated in the separatist protest with her husband, and she said she no longer had any hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
Last year we had our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they had the opportunity to vote for independence, but now we're screwed", he said.
Despite some minor victories in the regional elections in December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties are struggling to keep pace this year, as many of their well-known leaders have either left the country voluntarily or are in detention and awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the resulting declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who takes to the streets on her mobile phone to support police, says the conflict is fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is escalating", he said.
Oriol Zanzheras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed last year and awaiting trial, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to declare the degradation of democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish authorities", he said.
London: A number of men have been arrested for a car crash at a house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident occurred on the Ballynagar Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
According to Detective Inspector Bob Blemings, damage to the bottle and the building itself.
It's possible that the car may have been fired upon at some point.
Menga's goal brought Livingston to a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal won the game for Livingston.
A move by Livingston forced Rangers to hand over Steven Gerrard as manager to Ibrox after just the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Manga's goal proved the difference, with Harry Holt's team moving to the second tier along with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remained in the Premier League this season without a win, and with that, they face the leader Hart next week, who they are eight points behind.
In the meantime, Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston are six games out of their undefeated streak in the division, with head coach Holtz yet to lose a game since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston didn't take his chances with the Dune visitors.
The Holt team should have been promoted long before the goal was scored, their direct play in all zones was a problem for Rangers.
Scott Robinson hit well, but the front doorman missed the shot, then Alan Lithgow could only head Craig Holkitt across the door.
The hosts were happy to give the Rangers a chance to play in front of them, knowing they would have problems with guests after the game was rescheduled from standard situations.
And that was the tactic that made the deciding ball go.
Rangers gave him a free kick and Livingston worked on the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to deliver Mangala, who took a touchdown and scored from the penalty spot.
At that point, the Rangers had the advantage of the ball, but the defense was breakable, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems.
This continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos scored and Curry Kelly saved.
Scott Pittman's batting Ranger keeper Alan McGregor won the leg, also hitting Lithgow from a distance in another standard Livingston position play.
Penalties were a regular occurrence at Livingston and the ball was always taken out of the penalty area, although two penalties were awarded - after Holkitt's replacement by Glenn Middleton and the other for the game - both of which were scored.
The first is that the "Fanatic" is a "Fanatic" of Livingston.
The BBC Scotland's Alder Lamont at the Tony Macaroon Arena
Livingston's phenomenal play and score.
They're all brilliant players, constantly exceeding expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have changed significantly since their return to the top flight, but special thanks go to Holt for putting him in the team's grounds after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Holkitt was the unstoppable, highly organized head of the guard, and Manga never gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a rest.
Besides, Ranger was running out of inspiration.
They're sometimes very good under the leadership of the Gerard, but this time they've fallen far short of that standard.
Their final ball was not scored - they only hit the home team once - it's time for the Rangers to wake up, they're in the middle of the table.
The meeting was held in Cologne, Turkey.
There were many smiles and many blue skies at the lunch meeting of the Turkish and German leaders in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, a visit aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
They have different positions on issues like human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's admission to the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new gigantic mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police blocked a gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a sizable number of supporters still gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - including many Kurds - also tried to make their voices heard, criticizing both Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German authorities to invite him to the country.
The dual protest reflects a different attitude towards the visitor, with German Turks calling him a hero, while others call him an autocrat.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in Deptford, England.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they were working on identifying the man and would notify next of kin.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Six officers injured in riots at Long Lattin Prison
Six prison officers were injured during riots by the heightened security men inside the prison, the prison officer said.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartine Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 BST and is still ongoing.
Special officers from Tornado are called in to resolve the situation involving eight prisoners in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "HMP Long Lartin has been involved in the ongoing riots by specially trained prison staff".
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We are not tolerant of violence in prison, we are clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and will have to stay away from the prisoners for longer.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most feared criminals.
According to the report, in June, the warden was hospitalized after a prisoner attacked himself.
And last October, law enforcement officers were called in to cause a serious riot in the prison, during which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (may be useful in later locations)
Tropical depressions rarely hit Arizona, but that's what will happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa shifts to the desert's southwest side, likely to be followed by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already announced flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the Geyser directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only six tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mologan Rim, Arizona.
Desert in other areas of the southwest, including Central Rock and the Great Basin, is likely to be 1 or 2 inches, while total isolation can be as low as 4 inches.
For those who are at risk of flash floods, the Rose Rain can be beneficial, as the region is very muddy.
While flooding is a very serious concern, some heavy rain is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently in a state of thaw.
The United States Weather Monitoring Service reports that 40 percent of Arizona is in extreme weather conditions, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
The trail of Hurricane Rosa is heading to Mexico, on the Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still a strong storm Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm interacts with the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, and so it calms down.
So, we're looking at a tropical storm-force storm formation in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico could be very strong, with a serious threat of flooding.
A combined total of 3-6 inches of rainfall is expected in northwest Sanora Bay, California, with up to 10 inches of rainfall, weather.com reports.
Rosa then moves north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday, as a tropical depression that then moves through Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
The main threat from the hurricane or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rain in northwestern Sonora Bay in California and in desert regions of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the desert, as well as droughts in the mountainous region.
The attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for premeditated murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for the murder of a 16-year-old boy who was found with multiple stab wounds in the neck.
The injured teenage boy was found on a raised terrace in the Midsomer Norton area at approximately 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where his condition is stable.
Avon and Somerset Police said two teenagers aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Redstock slums the night before.
The police are calling and contacting anyone who may have any phone records of what happened and what was going on during the events.
As Trump said, Kavanaugh is fed up with the Democratic Party's anger and frustration.
"The vote for Kavanaugh is a vote to end the Democratic Party's brutal and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was feeling the influence and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Before appearing before Congress on Friday, Kavanaugh violently and emotionally denied all the evidence given by Christina Blaise Ford, who claimed that she had sexually assaulted him ten years earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president declared that "the American people have seen the beauty, the quality and the purpose" of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote for Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the greatest civilian figures of our time, a litigator with a record of accomplishments in the civil service", he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president also made a point of talking about Kavanaugh's nomination when he was talking about the situation the Republican Party has during the midterm elections.
"We are only five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I pretend I'm not a crab, but I actually am", he said.
"That is why, in each of these positions, I will fight to the end for this distinguished candidate".
Trump said that the main mission of the Democrats now is to contain and resist".
The first ballot of the GOP nomination will be held no later than next Friday in the Senate chamber, the GOP aide said in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed in the earthquake, tsunami, and massive rising waves that struck Indonesia.
On Saturday, government officials said at least 384 people died in the disaster, many of them victims of massive waves as a powerful tsunami and earthquake damaged the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands of people gathered on Palo Beach on Friday when waves as high as 18 feet (6 meters) hit the coastline, killing dozens and destroying everything in sight.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami first appeared yesterday, people were not able to flee and were left stranded again and became victims of this disaster", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Organization, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"In this case, it was not only the tsunami that was in place, it was moving cars, logs, houses and everything that came along the way", said Nugroho, noting that before the tsunami caused damage to the coast, it was moving at 800 km/h (497 mph).
He said that he had even cut down some trees to save himself, and that this method worked.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 different centers in Palo.
Documentary footage released by the Emergency Management Agency showed many of the buildings, shops and bridges that were damaged by the disaster, as well as a mosque surrounded by a large amount of water.
The next event was Saturday in the coastal city.
The earthquake series was in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Bureau of Power Planning and Technology (BPPT) reported that the energy released during the disaster was 200 times greater than the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical location along the coast may have contributed to the increased damage caused by the disaster.
Ngoroh described the incident as "large-scale" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were damaged.
The bodies of the victims were found in the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured in the accident, with 29 still being sought.
Nugroho also said that the casualties and damage could be greater in the northern slopes of Palo, 300 kilometers (190 miles) from the city, in the area of Dongola, where the epicenter of the earthquake was located.
Communication was "completely limited in terms of information transfer" between Dongola and other dependents, Nugroho said.
There are 300,000 people living in these slums", the Red Cross said, adding that their volunteers and staff are on their way to the scene.
"It's a tragedy, but it could have been worse", they said.
The agency came under considerable criticism on Saturday for providing timely information about the disaster that hit the city of Palo, with authorities saying the waves hit another city when the alert letter was still fresh.
In the content shared on social media, you can see a man standing on the roof trying to warn the people and give them a voice about the coming waves.
In a matter of minutes, a huge flood washed ashore, taking buildings and cars with it.
The news agencies were unable to take appropriate action in time.
The earthquake and tsunami damaged the inter-city power supply and made it virtually impossible for officials to circulate information.
Soldiers from Jakarta and other cities have begun sending first aid planes to the disaster area, but the victims still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport reopened for emergencies only and will not return to normal operation until October.
The president, Joko Widodo, is planning to visit the evacuation center in Sao Paulo on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia is over 800 feet high.
That's too bad.
Mr. Dosebas said that when World Vision staff were heading from Dongola to Palo, they had to see the scenes and locations before they reached the special areas for defense.
He stated that "they saw a number of houses destroyed by the disaster".
That's too bad.
Although various local relief organizations have started their activities and carried out various relief work or operations, several similar foreign organizations have been banned from entering the areas of Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, co-financing, aid or support can only enter the country if the incident is recognized as an international disaster area and acquires such status.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a low-level unconcerned incident", said Awliya Ariyanti, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government declares a national emergency, we can get international aid, but we haven't received any notification yet".
On the night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of the missing were hopeful that there was still a chance to save their loved ones, and that the dark traces of the natural disaster would not remain in their lives forever.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Jendon Subandono, the Indonesian paraglider coach, was training the two pilots who were lost in the crash and were due to compete in the upcoming Asian Games, scheduled for this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel became his students.
"As an experienced paraglider, I have my emotional limits", he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how quickly the events at the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the paratrooper community in just a few hours. He desperately sent them messages via WhatsApp to the participants in Palouse who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message only showed one gray sign, not two blue ones.
'I think that means they didn't get the message,' he declared.
The thieves took $26,750 from a bank machine in Newport Beach, New York, and used it to pay for the bank's bills.
According to the Newport Police Department's Information Group, the thieves were able to steal $26,750 from a seaman who was filling the bank machine at the time.
The driver was cleaning out the ATM and making room for more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy told the news.
While the driver was busy with his mission, another "came back to the border officer" and stole his bag full of money to be transported.
Eyewitnesses noted several suspects involved in the ongoing process, but police did not specify how many people were involved, according to the publication.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the suspects should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper's new name is Ye
Rapper Kenny West changes his name to Ye.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday: "I am formally known as Kenny West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a time, and he used that name for his eighth album, which was released in June.
In addition, Saturday's live stream will see Ken's different visual, which is where his new album, Yandhi, is expected to be released.
The show's host announced that she would be replacing Ariana Grande, who had withdrawn from the show due to an "emotional background".
In addition to the current professional name, which is a bit of an abbreviation for Ken, West has stated that the word has a religious value to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and it carries the meaning 'you' in the Bible", Ken said in an interview this year when he was discussing the title of his album with host Big Boy on the radio.
"I am you, I am us, this is us.
From Kenye, which means just yours, that name became Ye -- our metaphor for good and bad, chaos and everything.
The album is largely an anthem of who we are.
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by names such as Puff Daddy, P.Diddy or Daddy, but this year he announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
Former Western collaborator Jay-Z emphasized the need for capital letters and hyphens in his name.
Mexico's AMLO has pledged to refrain from using military force against civilians.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to refrain from using military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised people at a rally in Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would "never use military force to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers attacked civilians, killing 300 leftists, representatives of a movement with roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised monthly subsidies to young people and the opening of new public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into the criminal world.
The United States should double its funding for AI.
Kai-Fu Lee, an inventor and AI practitioner with experience at companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double the amount it spends on research.
The comment came after a number of U.S. government agencies issued statements about AI, highlighting the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy in place on the subject.
At the same time, China unveiled its plan last year: it plans to become the number one AI country by 2030.
"Doubling research funding would be a good start for America, given how far other countries are behind the United States in this regard, and we also expect other new achievements", Lee said.
The doubling of the money will further increase the chance that the next new discovery will be in the US in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Artificial Intelligence Superhumans: China, the Silk Road, and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China's largest artificial intelligence organizations.
In the 1980s, he worked on artificial intelligence systems that defeated America's top players at Carnegie Mellon University, and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee expressed sympathy for previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Defense Systems Competition, and wondered when the next such event would be held to better inform the prospects for the future.
Lee said that researchers in America often have to work hard to get grants.
"China is not boring the academic leaders; it's the corporations", he said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies are hiring top talent from universities to work with them on AI.
Lee also said that immigration reforms can also contribute to the development of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to people with a PhD in AI", he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
Li noted that the Chinese Science Foundation funds scientists working in educational institutions, like government agencies, and that American citizens can receive these funds, but the quality of research in China is still lower.
Recently, the United States Department of Defense created the United Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose main goal is to bring together people from industry and academia. The White House announced its readiness to establish an AI committee and to elect its members.
Also, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment they're going to make in a project called AI Next.
And also for the NSF, DAPRA is investing $100 million a year in artificial intelligence.
However, the US legislature, which has called for the creation of an AI security committee, is not going to back down this month.
Macedonians take part in the referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians participated in a referendum where they expressed their desire to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decade-long conflict between Macedonia and Greece that has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, has said that Macedonia claims Greek territory in its name, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries agreed to change the name in July, but nationalist opponents say such a move would undermine the Macedonian Slavic heritage and cost the country money.
President Georgi Ivanov has announced that he will not participate in the referendum, thus declaring a boycott and supporting those who are trying to block the 50 percent barrier.
The referendum ballot asked the following question: "Do you want to join NATO and the European Union through an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said that it was the price to pay for EU and NATO membership, as Macedonia was one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, to vote for the young people who can live in peace under the guise of the European Union, because it means a safer place for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevka, 79, in Skopje.
Despite the lack of a legal union, MPs said they would wait for the election results and see if the number of votes becomes decisive for the country.
Parliament needs more than two-thirds of the vote to change the name of the country.
The Election Commission said there were no reports as of 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent of the population had declared themselves by this time, which is significantly lower than the 2016 election, where 34 percent of the population had already declared themselves by this time and where finally 66 percent had registered their opinion on the ballot.
"I came here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko supported the name change for Macedonia, paving the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
At that time in Skopje, in front of the parliament, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, was setting up a small stage, bringing chairs and setting them up in front of the tents for those who were protesting against the referendum.
"We want NATO and the European Union, but we want to join these organizations with our own will, not at the cost of someone else's help.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can join Russia and China and become members of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO integration would bring more benefits in terms of investment to Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will make this choice because 80 percent of the country is in favor of joining NATO and the European Union", Zaev said in filling out his bulletin.
He said that the "yes" would be the result that "proves our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Research Institute, 30-43 percent of the population will participate in the referendum - which does not meet the requirements.
According to a second poll conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma, 57 percent of the population plans to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent of those polled are going to vote yes in the referendum.
To win the referendum, you need 50 percent plus one.
The referendum defeat is one of the biggest failures of the pro-Western government, which came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero manages to maneuver the defence of Brighton to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly finished off the defending champions of Brighton in Saturday's game, which was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England and ended in a 2-0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguero made scoring a goal for his opponent seem like a remarkably easy task in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentine forward got the ball in the middle of the field.
He passed through three of the Brigton defense before he was in the open.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green shirts.
He pushed one of the guards before he could get the others to stop and he would end up at the end of the 13-foot line.
After that, he passed the ball to Sterling.
Sterling used the first touch to return the ball to Aguero, who managed to get the right foot into the right corner of the net for Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is having problems with his feet", club coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We're going to give him 55, 60 minutes of playtime.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at the right moment".
But it was Sterling who was able to give the Blues the advantage in the current Premier League championship.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero earned the ball in the middle of the Brigaton.
He did a great job on Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball several times before he sent it towards Sterling.
The Blues' quarterback has kicked the ball several times before he can get it into the opposing team's goal.
In the Champions League group stage, City will face Hoffenheim and will play on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Chaser wants to play Spoiler vs. the Rockies.
After the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there wasn't much point in starting over.
But the always-competitive Chaser hopes his team can win against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, and only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs, and have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference.
On Friday night, the Rockies were able to win the Nationals with a tense 5-2 game record, but they still want to win their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can put our best foot forward on the field and know that with the atmosphere created by the fans in Denver and the team's opponents, it's possible to create the top-level game that's in my mind this year.
Why should I not be afraid to enter such a contest?
The Nationals' starting lineup for the week has not yet been released, but in such a case, Chezer will definitely take the pitcher's position.
This will be the 34th start for Cesar, as he came off the bench on Friday, which is why he will be pitching in the game of the week.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump runs the stock in West Virginia.
The president spoke aloud about the events surrounding Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court, as he spoke about the situation the Republican Party has during the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will pay off in November.
We're only five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the great, great events -- I don't pretend to be a voter, but I am, and that's why I'm trying to fight for these great candidates everywhere".
Trump also added, "You see the awful, awful bunch of Democrats, and you're watching all of this right now.
They're trying to take back power with all the means at their disposal, you see this lack of principle and this filth.
They don't care who they hurt, who they take advantage of, it's about power and control, that's what they want, and we're not going to give it to them".
He said that the Democrats' current mission is "to contain and resist".
"And you see that in the last four days", he said, and he said to the Democrats, "how angry, how rude, how unruly they are".
He also appealed to the Senate Judiciary Committee, to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who received a rather vociferous response from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
You leaked official documents?
Ah, ah, what?
No, no, no, no. That was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Work will not lose the church.
He's intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the activists, the driving force of my party, voted for my censorship, I was very surprised.
After all, I'm the last Labour MP who doesn't want to be admitted - and all because I'm just saying what I think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, deserves a similar response because she has been resolute against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censorship movement for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy has previously disagreed with leaders on issues like responsible economic policy in government, Europe, and so on.
A letter from the East Nottingham meeting said, "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
After eight years as a local MP, a Friday night meeting was just like that for me.
Unfortunately, meetings today do not have that tone, and the policy of "good and polite" has been forgotten, if ever there was such a thing.
It is quite clear that there is an intolerance of different views within the Labour Party, and each view is criticized only on the basis of whether the party leaders agree with it.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, and as a colleague he expected me to completely change my mind about a lot of things and take a position that I would never have agreed to in my life -- on the state defense issue, on the EU's unilateral trade.
When I speak in public - and I wish it was important - there's a lot of violence on social media, with calls for early elections, for the dissolution of the political centre, and for me to resign.
And it's not just my experience.
On the contrary, I consider myself lucky that some of the comments made about me are political.
I'm up against the professionalism and effort of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist incitement every day, but never run away from it.
In today's politics, it's frustrating that this kind of violence has become the norm for us.
Jeremy Chobnin said last week that Labour should embrace a tradition of tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer like the Church, and every "unstable" step or change in the party's internal structure makes it even smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about how to keep my head down, not raise my voice, and just in case, "It's all right".
But that's not what I came to politics for.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, and this decision was prompted by Thatcher's policies that disrupted the class system, I have made it my goal to serve those in the civil service who need it most -- whether as a local representative or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in East Nottingham to be confused about my political position and the disagreements I had with the ruling party at the time.
For those of you who were at the head of the meeting on Friday, the only thing I'm perhaps going to say is that when your country is heading towards Brexit, which could hurt real estate, business and civil service, I don't see why you should be willing to spend time and energy on such a loyalty stance towards the Labour leader.
But one message I have is not only to the members of the Nottingham Movement, but to my colleagues, to Labour and to everyone else: I am proud to have the opportunity to serve you, and I promise that no threat or bad political intent will stop me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Eyre 38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Eyre tops the table
The last two matches could have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumphant victory that this team achieved in the Tennis Premiership with today's game.
They're currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was their good defense and chances that allowed the team to establish a dominant position at home, which is why coach Peter Marsh could be pleased.
"We have tested our skills in every game, and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christian, from Melrose, said, "Respect the Air, they've taken a better chance than we have".
In the 14th minute, a shot by Grant Anderson, engineered by Fraser Climo, led the Ayres, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Harry Hughie gave Warriors a wide lead and allowed Melrose and Jason Begot to take their chances.
Climo then used a penalty to extend Eyre's lead just before the end of the first half to make the score 17-5.
The Melrose started the second half pretty well, which is why, with the help of Patrick Anderson and Bagot's finishing, they were able to reduce the lead to five points.
This was followed by a serious injury to Ruard Knott, who had to leave the field, but Ayr still managed to score and with McDowall's help, Clima was able to make a comeback.
The active Eire captain Blair McPherson was again awarded a yellow card, prompting Melrose to make an unsuccessful attempt to re-sign the players with heavy pressing.
The home team was able to get the game going, and when Stran Hutchison earned a yellow card for the weather, McPherson was able to score a touchdown and lead the Mountaineers to the end of the game.
Climax was able to pass the ball, and he did it every time, ever since Kyle Rowe kicked David Armstrong's box with Gregor Henry at home for the fifth time.
TV series, hard-core game star prepares to establish himself in the restaurant business.
Hardcore star Ford Kieran is about to move into the hospitality industry, and this news has come after it was revealed that he was named the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Carvis, 56, stars in the popular BBC comedy series, where he writes and collaborates with long-time comedy partner Greg Hampfield.
The duo stated that the ninth series for the series is final, and it seems that Kiran is going to make various changes after Craigslist.
According to official sources, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a Scottish source reports that Kearney is planning to bring Glasgow into the "restaurant trade industry".
'The Sea is Ours': Landlocked Bolivia hopes court will clear the way to the Pacific
The Marines from the Rising Cloud Authority are patrolling La Paz.
Dark blue flags are flying at public facilities.
The naval bases from Tikitake to the Amazon contain the following motto: "The sea is ours, in law.
It is our duty to bring him back".
Bolivia's impasse is due to the 19th Sakuen conflict, which ended in bloodshed with Chile - the pain of which still haunts the Pacific.
After five years of negotiations, Bolivia is eagerly awaiting the International Court of Justice's decision, due on October 1.
"Bolivia has a sense of unity and purity, and of course, it is waiting for a positive response", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to live-stream the international court case, and of course most of them believe that Chile will be forced to negotiate with the country and give up the sea for decades to come.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president - who is running for election next year - also has his own thoughts on Monday's rally.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific", he said last August.
But some analysts think that the chances of a decision in favor of Bolivia are very low, and even if it were, it would not change much.
One of the Netherlands-based UN centers has no influence on Chilean territory, and has stated that their intervention will have no influence on this negotiation.
The International Court of Justice said it would issue a ruling within six months of the final hearing, meaning the case was not "close", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the improvement in Bolivia may have been even more so in the last four years.
"The return of the sea gate has been ordered by the Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
Bolivia's bellicose spirit may have eaten away at the last drop of goodwill in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to continue after this.
The two countries have not sent an ambassador since 1962.
Former Bolivian president and representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Velze, rejected the view that the court's process was unusually fast.
Monday will give Bolivia the chance to "expose new possibilities for new relations with Chile" and give it the chance "to resolve the 139-year dispute to the satisfaction of both sides", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the conflict as a political leverage.
"Bolivia will never give up the opportunity to have access to the Pacific", he added.
"Returning to the past is a chance to prove that we have come out of the past".
North Korea has said that the process of nuclear disarmament will not begin until they trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said they would never develop nuclear weapons unless they trusted Washington.
RIM spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow through on the commitments made at the Singapore summit between the two rival nations.
Of course, the United States has also commented on his remarks, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of renewing talks with Kim Jong Un that began in Singapore three months ago.
Ri says that the US sanctions and the declaration of the end of the Korean War is a "good dream" to push North Korea back.
Washington is planning to sign the declaration before Fchenan takes the first step toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
On the other hand, there is a widespread skepticism that Fakhnyan is seriously considering denying arms because he sees it as the only way to peace.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show has unveiled a massive collection of the latest headgear that could cover your streets.
If you want to increase the size of your sunscreen, or to protect your body from the sun completely, don't go far.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a huge and quirky set of hats for their SS19 collection, which took Parisian style to a surprise at the current Fashion Week.
Highly uncomfortable coats have taken over the Instagram world this summer, and designers are still not catching up on the spread of the trend from afar.
The demo version was made by Valentino, and the details included in it would be a massive bubble that would completely cover the models' heads.
Other huge accessories included a carved winter coat, a witch's hat, and a pineapple -- but their main purpose is not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also released his collection of weird masks - just as Halloween was coming.
Most of them completely cover their lips and portray a cannibal lector rather than a representative of the fashion world.
One creature was wearing a bowhead with its swimming glasses and straps, while the other was shaped like a sleeping hawk.
And if you keep up with the trend of huge things coming up, you're lucky.
Stylists have suggested that huge bonnets might even cover the streets in your immediate vicinity.
The huge hat in the collection includes La Bomba high-heeled shoes, which have a two-foot upper border and could be seen on people like Riana and Emily Ratyakovsky.
The iconic creature in the form of a giant hat that has taken over social media has given rise to a new creature on the podium: a long beach bag that is as big as the model who is wearing it.
The dark orange raffinade bag, stuffed with raffinade heads and bearing a white lead nameplate, is one of the pieces in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection from Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luc Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to big streets and beach bags lining the streets for next summer - because the designer has been so influential, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand.
J. Edward: Foreign language is an important skill for citizens of the world.
The Scottish Independent Schools Association has been monitoring academic achievement, and they're continuing this process in 2018, with a focus on good academic performance, which has been strengthened more recently in sports, the arts, music and other social fields.
The 30,000 pupils represented by the Schools Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) in Scotland are always available to provide the highest level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for higher education, for their chosen careers, and to be global citizens.
As the education sector is able to create a proper curriculum in schools, we see foreign languages as the most popular and sought-after subject to be chosen in schools in the future.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, it goes directly to their mind.
If you speak in their native language, it goes straight to their heart".
This reminds us once again that we cannot rely on English alone when trying to build relationships and trust with people from different countries.
Among independent schools, it is clear from the results of the previous years that foreign languages stand out in terms of the highest scores and rankings.
68 percent of foreign language students scored the highest A's.
According to data collected from 74 SCIS partner schools, 72 percent of students scored highest in Chinese, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also scored highest.
This is another example of how independent schools in Scotland are supporting the development of foreign languages as a crucial skill for the future of children.
Languages are now given as much attention as STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK job survey found that 17 percent of job applicants were held back from applying because of language barriers.
So more and more attention is being paid to foreign languages to prepare young people for their future careers.
As the number of jobs in different languages grows in the global world, so does the demand for these skills.
Regardless of career choice, if someone learns a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future in having skills that will always be useful.
Communicating with a person of another nationality in his or her native language always helps a person to get ahead in terms of employment.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 British teenagers in 2013, 75 percent could not communicate in any other language, and 15 percent could only conduct simple dialogue in French.
And now that language learning is important for our children, that's why we're investing so much in it.
Knowing several languages, especially in emerging economies, equips children with skills that will be important for their employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different depending on the foreign language classes.
One part of the schools focuses on popular classical languages, while the other part focuses on languages that will be important to the UK by 2020, and those languages are Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a language that will interest him and that he can learn from experienced staff and specialists.
The Scottish Independent Schools Alliance is committed to creating a desirable learning environment for children and equipping them with all the skills they need in the future.
No one can deny that foreign languages play a huge role in the economic development of a country, and that should be the case with education.
Moreover, foreign languages should be considered "a skill necessary for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer students choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward, headmaster of the Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron's debut with the Lakers is in San Diego.
Fans are eagerly awaiting LeBron James' first start with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that LeBron will play the Denver Nuggets in Sunday's preseason game in San Diego.
But how long it will play is still unknown.
"The number of innings will be greater than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would most likely play for a limited time.
At last week's practice, James was asked about his plans for the preseason games.
"I don't need a preseason game to prepare for this", he said.
Trump's West Virginia speech, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign series today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, and the next stop on his list is in places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The letter, which was filed with the Supreme Court, will build support for the midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia, and how do we watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the live broadcast of Trump's speech via the YouTube channel link below.
Trump will most likely introduce Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been embroiled in a sexual assault dispute over the past few days that is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
But the main purpose of these meetings is to win some confidence in the November election.
Accordingly, Trump's campaign office said the next five meetings are aimed at "strengthening lobbying and support as Republicans seek to protect majorities and further strengthen them in the Senate and House of Representatives", Reuters reported.
"Controlling Congress is crucial as the president plans to visit as many states as possible during the busy campaign", said a Trump campaign spokesman who denied being identified as Reuters.
According to the Metro News of West Virginia, the game, which will be played at Westbank Stadium in Wheeling, could draw fans "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and it will be covered by the Pittsburgh media".
Last month, next Saturday, Trump visited West Virginia for the second time, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morse, whose results are fluctuating in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey when the president is going to attract supporters", Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA hopefully prepares for Sunday's individual competition
After three singles seasons, the Saturday night quarterfinals may be just what the Ryder Cup has been looking for for so long.
The variability of motivation and fate is a completely fabricated model in sports, but athletes still hope for it, especially in a competition like the Ryder Cup.
Now, what do they say, where's their momentum?
"We had a six-man advantage, now we have four, so we're going to take this as a small push", said Jordan Spitzer as he set off for his destination today.
Of course, to take advantage of Europe, you have four extra points and a chance to score another twelve points.
Americans, Spitzer says, feel that they are being bullied by very little fear, because they are very motivated before the game, as evidenced by the level of play of Spitzer and Justin Thomas, who trained together and scored three out of four.
Spitzer was known for his unpredictability throughout the course of the game, and he's leading the way in that.
The ceremony was made even more noisy after the round of siesta, with Thomas and Spit scoring two points in the second.
His 15th-place finish in the shot put also drew similar calls, which meant the Americans were not going to be out of the championship.
"The only thing that's bothering me is to focus and be nervous about my game", Spit said.
That's what each player has left for the moment.
18 innings to go.
The only players to have more points than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, from the Ryder Cup.
Europe doesn't have much of an advantage, but a great couple has lost four out of four and can't be eliminated.
Hollywood is the only place where they didn't shoot bogey on Saturday night, they avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday night and Friday morning at nine.
From the match, and the energy that both players have, it's clear that the audience doesn't find it funny that no player can cover a European win and the sun will necessarily set on Le Golf National or Molinari.
Maybe both, but different depths.
But it's still not the time to talk about European glory.
Buba Watson and Webb Wimpson did a little work on Sergio Garcia, the four-legged hero of the morning who was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two double points were scored by the Spaniard and dropped by the Swede, and they've never been this close to gaining the advantage.
But on Sunday, no one can use your walk-in closet.
Quadrangular and pair games are very interesting to watch, because you can see the relationships of the couples, the advice they give each other, and the strategy that might change in the future.
Europe has certainly played better as a team and has a remarkable advantage for the last day but the American team has also shown that they have the prospect to fight and they are not going to stand on the sidelines, so everything is still questionable.
Europe has a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will be coming off a big advantage on the final day after they beat the United States team during the game on Saturday to win 10-6 in the final.
The duo of Tom Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won the race over Tiger Woods, who was struggling to get on the pair at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bion, from the European side, doubts that he will be able to regain the trophy he won two years ago, as Europe dominated the US in the morning's pair play and won 3-1.
The United States needs even more resilience, and despite two victories, they can't get to the end of the line.
Jim Farr's team needs eight points from 12 games this week to win the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win the quadruple sculls since he and Molinari won the thrilling Moliwood and came close to winning the thrilling Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed, their main goal is to defeat American rookie Bryson DeCembeau by 5 and 4 points.
Although Woods showed an extraordinary performance on Saturday, he has lost 19 of 29 games, with seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose chose a break for the morning quartet, he is partnered with Henrik Stenson, with whom 2&1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in the pairing - the number one and third players in the world.
In the parched southwest of Paris, Europe really didn't have easy games.
Three-time winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the double-elimination barrier against the Americans after Saturday's game.
They won 2&1 against the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Poulter in a draw and then came back to beat Poulter and Rory McClarry 4&3 where the pair lost the opening two overs.
Only twice in history has a team been knocked out by a four-legged tie, and it is also worth noting that the Fury team only need to tie the score to win.
After two days of being at their best, there's more to come in the week than a counterattack.
North Korea says it will not disarm "under any circumstances" without gaining confidence
Speaking at the United Nations, North Korea's foreign minister said the sanctions had created further mistrust of the United States and that it would not disarm in such a situation.
Ri Yong-ho told the World General Assembly that China had taken "kind steps" in the past few years and had stopped nuclear and military weapons testing, studied them further, and vowed not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology further.
"But we don't see the appropriate response and action from the US side", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security, and we are not going to be the first to disarm our country under such conditions".
When Ri made the statement about what they were up against in the "phase" for America, his statement seemed to reflect sharply the act of not completely rejecting unilateral disarmament, an action that Fchenyan had taken two years earlier.
Ri also pointed to the agreements and shortcomings of the June 12 summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump in Singapore, where Kim promised Trump to "work on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" when Trump promised him North Korea's security.
North Korea would receive the nuclear weapons toward the formal end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that it would surrender the nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refrained from discussing the lifting of sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States calls for Korea to 'disarm first' and to increase pressure through sanctions to achieve this goal, and also to rely on the 'Declaration of the End of War,'" Reem said.
"The idea that sanctions can hold us back is just a dream for those who have no idea about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions in place are only fueling our distrust.
What he didn't mention was the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader outlined at the United Nations this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings he had with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the issue of weapons had been addressed to South Korea instead of the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so difficult".
However, Rice's tone of speech was markedly different from that of last year's United Nations summit. The General Assembly, which was aimed at negotiating between the United States and North Korea, became irreplaceable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
At a joint meeting in 2017, Trump, who last year vowed to utterly destroy Kim and North Korea, taunted the North Korean leader, but said there was more to do and that sanctions would remain in place until Korea began the process of disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time to do this, "If it takes two years, three months, five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward him for his courageous step.
At the same time, the United States Secretary of State told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must continue to implement the orders given in unison, without any interference, to finally confirm disarmament".
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to restrict and reduce funding for nuclear and firearms development for Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri during a UN meeting and announced that he would be coming to Phenyngyan next month to plan a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last meeting didn't go so well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had only been made by North Korea in forming its "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged to review its disarmament process this month and "take appropriate action".
Reem said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised him in Singapore, where he promised to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students took a course on getting enough rest.
Harvard University has launched a special course for all students that focuses on teaching students how to get enough rest at a time when the trend of nightmares and caffeine addiction among the younger generation is increasing day by day.
Academics have found that students who get into the top university don't even know how to behave.
Charles Zissler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed this course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She decided to start a course like this after learning about the impact of sleep disorders on learning.
'A girl came to me after one of the meetings and said, 'Why am I being told this now, in my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him about the need for sleep before, which surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
The course, which began in the spring, is designed to teach students how good sleep can have a big impact on academic and athletic performance, and overall health.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce such a course after seeing how many children had sleep disorders during the week.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
One section shows images of various items, such as coffee cups, scarves, exercise shoes, and books, and tells about the effects of exposure to caffeine and sunlight, and how they affect athletic performance, and what it means to have a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are asked how much sleep disruption increases their risk of heart attack, cancer, and depression.
The map, with its signs, is placed on the campus to encourage students to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students completely.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as they have a right to know what happens when they smoke", said Professor Sisler.
The 'night-stand' culture still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students are contributing to the increase in sleep disorders.
Well, getting good sleep should be the secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue, and irritability -- and to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep starves our bodies and makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Sisler write the course after he had met him as a freshman in a class last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and motivated him to develop a broad course of concepts.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduates to take a similar course before they re-enter the learning environment.
Professor Sisler advises students to set their alarm clock both before going to bed and before waking up, and he suggests that students avoid the blue light, which is reflected by electric screens and LED lights, and can significantly alter the heart rate, which can lead to sleep disturbance.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Manga's goal defeats the Gerard boys
Rangers suffered another defeat on home soil after Dolly Mango's goal defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1-0.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone last February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerard to give him his second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind Ledbrook in the heart of the Premier League leaders.
Menga's shot was taken seven minutes before the end of the first half, and broke the Rangers' line, which had not been at the height of the call before.
As Rangers were relegated to sixth place, Livingston finished third, just one goal behind Hibernian.
And the Rangers may have an extra problem, after their starting pitcher Calum Spencer was hit in the head by an off-field object.
Gerard made eight changes during the game to the side that beat Ayr in the quarter-finals of the Bedford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same 11 that scored him last week, and he's grateful for the reaction his players get in every game.
Maybe the Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with that ball than they did.
Rangers were supposed to be sent off two minutes before Menga could score for Scott Pittman in the first innings, but Rangers' attack was overturned by the opposing midfielder.
Keegan Jacobs' penalty shot reached Skipper Craig but was sent back by defender Alan Lithgow.
The Rangers were able to get the ball back, but in the end, they seemed to have more faith than hope.
Alfredo Morelos believed he was being given a chance to score a penalty after Stephen Lowell hit him, but the referee withdrew the request by waving the flag.
Rangers scored two runs in the first half, but it was not difficult for the opposing goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, to catch the balls from Lasagna and Ovie Ejaria.
At the time, Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute might have been the deciding factor, and no one can deny that he deserved it.
The Rangers were again unable to cope with Jacobs' deep defense.
Scott Arfield is not involved because Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Robinson, who then took the ball and passed the manga to finish the attack.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent at half-time, and the change had some effect on the wing, but a blocked shot from the defender wiped it all out.
But Livingstone still managed to maintain the desired pace and thereby destroy his opponent, using the long passes of Lithgow and Hacklet.
Holt could have taken the lead at the end, but McGregor remained firmly on the field and did not allow every move by Jacobs to pass until Lithgow called a corner from a distance.
Rangers' change, Glen Middleton also requested a penalty at the end of the game, but the referee also refused.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Saturday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and counting -- the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Egger was born in Germany.
He invented a method for measuring and detecting radioactivity, a discovery that laid the foundation for the whole of Hager.
In science, the Hegger's heel has since become a part of popular culture, as well as in the 1950 film The Colorado Bell, which features a dialogue between scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this world?"
ROGERS: This is a whole geyser, used to exploit radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the interactions of the atoms of the minerals that are radioactive".
Evans: "You said it was really blowing this moment!"
Hans Egger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to detect overwhelmed cells
A new cancer vaccine trains the immune system to detect and kill invaded cells.
The discovery of the cells that have been killed by the vaccine is part of the treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient's body and changing them in the laboratory.
Once they've changed, they can find proteins that are specific to many types of cancer and then re-inject them.
The trial vaccine is showing satisfactory results among cancer patients.
One woman's ovarian cancer was cured for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells, changing them in the laboratory to find the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then re-injecting them.
"The results show that there is hope", says Jay Berzowski, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Maryland.
"HER2 causes the growth of tumors of breast, ovarian, lung, and intestinal cancers", he says.
Similar approaches to immune cells are used to treat leukemia.
Kenny West started the pro-Trump campaign, wearing a hat on Saturday Night Live that said, "Make America Great Again".
This whole thing didn't work out.
Kanye West's speech caused a stir on the show. In his performance, he accused US President Donald Trump of saying he would run for president again in 2020.
On the third song, "Vision City", he touched his hat with the words "Make America Great Again". His emotional speech was directed against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump when he's a racist?'
West said, "If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
"Saturday Night Live" began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon was filmed in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault by Christine Ford.
Although West's speech was not televised, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if he was trying to make a mockery of Rocky West with this post.
West was also concerned that he would have trouble with the hat behind the scenes.
"They were all over the stage.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that country".
They've got me!
And then they said I was stuck", reports the Washington Examiner, speaking of the West.
West continues: "I would wear a Superman mask, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love".
His comments caused dissatisfaction at least twice among the audience and cast members. One person told Variety: "There was a kind of silence in the studio".
West was invited to the show by singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West stunned many with a performance of his song "I Love You" in which he wore a Perrier Bottle costume.
West was endorsed by the head of the conservative NGO TPUSA, Candy Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most pathetic people: Thank you for standing up to the mob".
The talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being who she is, and that's great".
"But I cannot reward anyone (by buying their music or supporting their 'activities') who propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are free too", he added.
Before the show started, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his formal name to YE.
He is not the first artist to change his name, as did Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince, who changed his name to "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince".
Attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man with a knife at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Balihakamore.
The accused will appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The public prosecutor's office will review the charges.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Harrington is talking about "toxic masculinity"
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as Jon Snow on the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor discusses the stereotype of the hero macho, saying that when you see characters like this on screen, boys think that if they are cheerful, they will gain respect from others.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said "something is wrong" and wondered how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married 31-year-old "Game of Thrones" star Rose Leslie, admits that he feels strongly about tackling the problem.
"I feel strongly now - where did we go wrong with the masculinity?" she says.
"What did we teach boys when they were growing up? That's why we see these problems now".
Keith believes that some of the problem is due to the presence of male characters on television.
He goes on to say, "What is natural and what is the lesson?
What is taught on the streets and on television that forces boys to stand up for what is called being a man?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is, how can we change this?
Because obviously something is not right with young men".
In an interview, he admitted that he will not be involved in the prequel and sequel to "Game of Thrones" when the final series is released next summer. He says he "loves the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's remake of The Real West, which is about a film producer and his rogue brother.
The actor recently stated that the best thing about being in "Game of Thrones" was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on that show, so I actually started my family on that show. That's where my life begins", he said.
Rose plays Igrit, who falls in love with Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.

China is talking about a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of people infected with HIV has increased by 14 percent.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of them were transmitted through sex, which is different from past experiences.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in different parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected in this way has almost gone to zero, Chinese health ministry officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, the number of people infected with HIV in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people continues.
Studies show that because of the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Disease is transmitted through the use of improper protective measures during sex.
After 2003, the Chinese government pledged to make AIDS treatment available to everyone to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaks of Republican Senators' data by staff members, calling it "dangerous lies" and "theories of the spurious".
U.S. House of Representatives Rep. Maxine Waters denies allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff shared the personal information of three Republican senators and posted it on Wikipedia pages.
He claimed that the charges were driven by far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
The personal information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was leaked online by an unknown source on Friday, as the Senate was holding a panel hearing on sexual assault charges against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState say the post was uploaded from an IP address that is linked to the voters' office.
"This is a baseless accusation, it is false and an absolute truism", Waters continues.
"My staff is not responsible for the leak. We have reached a compromise on their identity, privacy and security.
"This is a baseless accusation, it is false and it is a total lie".
Waters's claim was quickly met with criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flesher.
"He angrily denies it", writes Fleischer.
"This fact tells us that Voters does not have the necessary temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he does not get angry.
You don't become a Jew.
People don't ask questions about the motives of the accuser.
It keeps you calm and unconcerned".
Fleischer apparently compared Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is voting for Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his cabinet had warned "relevant agencies and law enforcement agencies about this fraud".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found", he continued, "and that they are legally held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
A review of Johnny English's new hit, The Weak Parody of a Spy by Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new British trend film, and it seems to be about this new French version of Johnny English's parody of the action-comedy genre - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with the film The John English Transfiguration.
Ironic self-deprecation should be a new opportunity for our nation to export the theme of what a blatant piece of garbage we are.
Anyway, the blindfolded, resin-faced incompetent John English has been re-licensed to spoil everything - he gives us a signal more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course he is a silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims to light glamour, has the qualities of a bit of a clown, the strings of Mr. Bean and the characteristics of a gel with a raised fur that contributes one note to the motif of the fire-wheel at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the traveller and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial that wreaked havoc on its way.
There's a good point or two in this last part of Johnny English.
I loved it when John in England, dressed in his medieval costume, approaches a helicopter and the rotor heads are slamming into his face.
Atkinson's physical comedy talent is on display, but the humor seems a little weak and oddly exaggerated, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible themselves confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
It feels like humor is meant for kids and not adults, and to me, Johnny English's silly misadventures are not as creative and focused as Atkinson's silly Mr. Bean jokes.
The constant current message today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated a top-secret British spy website, revealing the identities of all British field agents, before the next agent worries - Kevin Eldon's small role unfortunately.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, a pompous and militant figure who is already experiencing a complete breakdown in political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa May character, but there's not much to work with in the script.
His intelligence advisors tell him that since every spy is compromised, he needs to get someone out of retirement.
It means that John English himself is being made a fool, currently working as a teacher in some prestigious institution, but informally teaching how to be a secret spy: here are some good jokes when the English school offers a rock-and-roll spy academy.
Inglis was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former tormented partner Buff, again played by Ben Miller.
Buffy is now a married man, married to a submarine captain, a fun hockey yellow roller, where Vicky Pepperdine is a little lost.
So, in the service of His Majesty's secret service, the terribly misguided Batman and Robin are reunited in action, and suddenly they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful lady-in-waiting, Ofelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer challenge: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lesley.
Inglis and Buffy begin their odyssey with farcical high-stakes: with bearable smiles, they set fire to an expensive French restaurant; they create chaos and steal Volta's expensive yacht; and Inglis induces holy anarchy when she tries to use a virtual reality device to get a closer look at the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops, of course, are taken in this last sequence, but as kind and energetic as it is, there are very few children's TVs for that.
It's a rather mediocre thing.
And just like in all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that was really fair to her talent?
The Labour Party has refused to come up with a plan for the British to work four days a week and get paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons will work four days a week - but get paid five.
The party is reportedly asking the company's executives to spend the savings made by the AI revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This will allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring home the same pay.
Sources say the idea is to "adjust" the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country happy for the benefit of the workers.
The shift to a four-day week has already been embraced by unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced by the end of this year.
'It won't happen immediately, but the four-day work week is an aspiration that is consistent with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party is not the first to come up with this idea, the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
The move is not currently fully endorsed by the Labour Party, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being discussed by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to make clear his views on the economy of socialist economics.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to hand over power to the "unnamed directors" and "speculators" in utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also envisage that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to fully recover their interests as the Labour government may be "dismissed" on the basis of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the company's board and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies to employees, equivalent to an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, they're telling 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh is going to change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week and the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court and raises questions as to whether the FBI's findings will force Republican senators to back him.
In an interview aired this week, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could come up with anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the charges were filed, and I said, 'Are you Kenny?'
He was firm, unyielding, distinct".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unsteady.
"My mind is completely occupied with Brett Kavanaugh, and it's going to be a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blessing Ford.
"And whoever he is, no one can prove it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any change".
What is the World Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, New York City hosts the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive lineup of performing stars and an equally impressive mission: to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the vast plaza of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an addition to the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty, and increase the number of people fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), attendees must complete a series of tasks, or "activities", such as volunteering, writing to a world leader, making a phone call, or in any other significant way to raise awareness about the event's true purpose, which is to end poverty.
But just how successful is the World Citizen Festival, 12 years before it's done?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a true way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" - where people think they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or posting on Twitter?
Since 2011, Citizen World tells us that it has counted over 19 million "activities" from its supporters, pushing for various causes hosted by the organization.
He reports that these activities helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had cited 390 commitments and declarations from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the money provided has directly affected more than 649 million people worldwide.
Some of these commitments are the power of food, a UK-based partnership of investors and performers pledged to "help children reach their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end food shortages in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of food insecurity a thing of the past", said Food Force Ambassador Tracy Ullman at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities calling on the UK to improve food for mothers and babies, the government announced it would fund the Food Power Project, which will reach 5 million women and children with food security.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, which asks, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world said, "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and lose.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monet are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy to blockade Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
"If necessary", Washington could use its navy to disrupt Russian energy, hit markets, including in the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And, according to official data, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing an event hosted by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as "The Voice of the Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He went to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and noted that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option with Russia and Iran is more or less to use and replace the fuel bucket", he said, referring to Russia as "a specialty", whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
There are reports that the Trump administration is aiming to increase its liquefied gas exports to Europe and make Russia a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to reject the "unreasonable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "spoon" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the volume of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin maintains that Washington's lukewarm opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in Moscow after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The US position caused dissatisfaction from Germany, which confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to abandon EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said the chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
At the Holyoke City Council in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a bid.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and make our broken government, and that includes having a woman in charge", she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren challenged President Donald Trump in his mayoral campaign, saying that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to the bone about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was candid when he criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need a federal investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters did not think he should vote in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probably" voters said that a senator should not cast a ballot.
Twenty-two percent support running for this office.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of the potential candidate and 48 percent against him.
Other well-known names in the Democratic Party are considering the possible 2020 election involvement of Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin quotes from the post-traumatic stress disorder of Treacy Palin at the Donald Trump campaign.
Treck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
She was arrested and charged with domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are going through post-traumatic stress disorder separations and some of the injuries that our soldiers have come back with", he told an audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his detention "blinding the obvious problem", and said of his son and other veterans, "They come back a little bit changed, they come back with a little bit of heart, they come back wondering if they're getting the respect that their fellow soldiers and pilots and other military members gave for their country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said included domestic violence and carrying a firearm while awake.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support New Asylum Laws
Thirteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that does not provide shelter for victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed court-friendly briefings in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers calling for policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case against Grace Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her violent gang-member children" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Government officials supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States as these nations face acute problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence and seek asylum.
In a statement Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, said the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and this restriction violates that principle", the judge said.
The believers then argued that the policy of barring immigrants from entering the United States was a violation of U.S. policy, saying it would make them more entrepreneurial and "provide us with the necessary manpower".
In June, the Confederate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who have left their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said during the policy announcement on June 11.
Sanctuary has never been the answer to all the problems -- even the most serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Volunteer rescue efforts in Palo, where the number of people killed in the search for survivors is doubling
For survivors, the situation became more difficult.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she consoled her cold-stricken child at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palouse.
"Every minute, ambulances are bringing bodies in.
Clean water is not enough".
People are returning to their ruined homes, digging up their submerged property, trying to salvage anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude quake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has a broken hip and shoulder, were resting outside the Paulo Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he began to feel again when a violent earthquake hit the fifth-floor room of the hotel where he and his wife and daughter lived.
"It was not time to save ourselves.
I followed the ruins of the wall, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my husband ask for Shelagh, then I was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'propaganda' and 'violence'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in which the US daily demanded general concessions on US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday wrote an expensive op-ed for the Daily Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election, which clarified what US officials told Reuters, became a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war, where they are raising tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the leading exporter of agricultural commodities to China, says Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Bransted wrote in the Monday issue of the Des Moines Register that China "is now doubling down on this violence by spreading propaganda in our free press".
"In its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstead.
"In contrast, here in Beijing, along the street in a newspaper column, you will see a limited difference of opinion and you will not see a true reflection of the difference of opinion that the Chinese people may have on the trajectory of China's troubled economy, which shows us that the media is under the heavy shadow of the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish his article", although he did not say which newspaper.
With Kavanaugh's defeat, Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the midterms, analysts warn.
While senior Republicans are on hold to protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn they will face a negative result in the midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions around this were extremely high, and most Republicans already registered for the Yo and feel they want to move forward with the vote.
You can't back down on that", Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that a last-minute push by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to investigate the FBI would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the progressive group MoveOn and national spokeswoman, according to The Washington Post on Friday.
During the demonstration in Senate Chambers on Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high", Steve Rosenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among volatile female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, don't often vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony that reflects his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts predict that it will backfire if Republicans push forward with evidence.
"It's been a silly riot for Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether to put the canoe in the chair, it's also about how Republicans approach it and how they handle it", Gay Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps Democrats choose, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat skewed about who to believe in the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, and are slightly more supportive of the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents necessarily or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they necessarily or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent say Kavanaugh probably or unquestionably lied when giving testimony, while only 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh raped her in a state of denial when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals when they were at a party while she was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet to overtake Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new project that is competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what rights people have to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do this now", he said at the start.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to have their own "personal online data warehouse", or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being available in one browser at the same time.
What's unique about online personal data storage is that it's entirely up to the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "First empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to dedicate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few employees of the developer who were contracted to work on the project, and a pool of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they will introduce a complete change where all their business models are fully integrated in one day.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial power and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the newly created network on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he formed the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the receipt of the Victoria Cross by a clergyman in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross for fighting in World War I is commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel the Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Belanglis and Lecourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military honour.
On Saturday, in a parade, his two grandchildren erected a memorial stone in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was erected exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vanne led his battalion along the St. Canton Canal "in the face of very thick fog and heavy artillery and gunfire".
Then he stepped into the line of fire and "very gallantly" led the line forward to the artillery and shot out three of them.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - exactly one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "what I couldn't do, but what humility is".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, were also crowned after the parade, which was led by the Imperial Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said he "feels very honored to be in the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that is given by many people".
Mixed martial arts fans spent the night watching Bellator 206, instead choosing the goat Peppa.
Imagine you lit up the whole night to get hired for Bellator 206, and you couldn't get to the main event.
The San Jose Report covered 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., after Gerard Moussac and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet, UK viewers were surprised when the broadcast switched to a taped tape.
Some are willing, after they've been up all night just for that night.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some sick joke".
"It's a state regulation that at 6 a.m. this show was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a kids' program", said David Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the show.
"Baby, what's wrong with you?"
Bellator president Scott Coker said they were working on their schedule to keep the UK audience in mind in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we might come up with something", said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't work on it until it's Sunday in our time and Monday in their time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when it changed, there was a lot of text going back and forth, and none of it was friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't. It was a government job.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're going to have five fights instead of six -- as we normally do -- we tried to make ourselves look more to the fans and it just came out of the blue.
This is a sad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "depressed" because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic fencer Tom Dale says he grew up feeling pushed around by others because of his sexual orientation - but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old says she didn't realize it until she went to high school, where "everyone is not like me".
First, in a talk on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about gay rights to "give others hope".
He also stated that since becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on Laverne's first show, Daley stated that growing up, she felt "less than" others because she was "socially unacceptable when both boys and girls liked you".
She said, "Today, that feeling of being inferior and different was real, and it gave me strength, it gave me a reason to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a prominent LGBT campaigner and used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to get more countries to join in protesting discrimination against homosexuality.
She said she took her voice out because she was lucky, she lived openly without ramming, and she wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that the man she fell in love with - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Blake, whom she met in 2013 - "had me by surprise".
Dale married Oscarossan, who is 20 years older than her, last year, but she said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're your age, you're going to do so much", he said, competing in his first Olympics at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find anyone your age who's been through the ups and downs of that".
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Blackdale, and Dale says his "total values" changed.
"Last year, if you ask me, all I wanted was to win the gold medal", he said.
"You know, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My gold medal is Rob".
Her son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that her father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die, and one of the last things she asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because she wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be on the front lines, Dad,'" she said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it didn't happen, until he really stopped breathing and died, that I finally realized he wasn't immortal", she said.
The following year, Dailey competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of my fans at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that", he said.
This also inspired her to choose her first song - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated with her during her Olympic run and still bears the name of the strudel.

Michelson, who was out of form, was in the Ryder Cup squad on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record this week when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match in a row, but he needs to get back in shape before it becomes a disaster for him.
Michelson, who will be entering the event for the 12th time in a record two years, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's Forball and Dressage.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he often was in the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game in the hope of fixing what was bothering him.
Never, the most correct driver, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not perfectly suited to the Le Golf National course, with a long and rough penalty for constantly misspelling.
And if the course itself isn't tough enough, Michelson, in Game 9 of Sunday, is up against the defending British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who is racing with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans start four points down in the 12-game singles, in the heat of the moment, the Michelsonian will be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, not that he could say much more.
"He was completely aware of the role I was playing today, so he put his hand on my ring, shook my hand, and told me he'd be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
"He's very confident.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's done a lot of things for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't realize he was playing two games.
I was more of a disruptor, but that's how it worked, and that's the way we thought we should go.
He wants to be there, and so does everyone else".
On Sunday, Michelson will beat Nick Faldo, who holds the record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the heights of his individual records.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought some unpleasant feelings.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a good guy to have on your team", he explained.
"I think the young players joined him, just like this week, which was a good sight.
It's much more than just a game".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big difference could soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that being far ahead in the final day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
Deane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the side, captained by Steve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans but came within a narrow margin of the finish line, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big difference over Valdermón; we had a big difference in Brooklyn where we lost, and Valdermón where we won, but only", said Björn, after watching the 2018 5-3 win both on Friday and yesterday when they had a 10-6 advantage at Le Golf National.
So the story shows me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're playing full-time tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
It's not complete until the points are written on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try and win the cup, and that's what we're focused on.
I've been saying all this time, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side, the greatest players in the world".
Bjorn, who was pleased with the way his players played during a tense golf match, added: "I could not have imagined it.
Tomorrow we'll have another beast.
We're going to have a one-on-one tomorrow, and that's different.
It's a great feeling to be out there with your partner, when everything is going well, but when you're out there alone, you're just going through the test like a golfer.
That's the message you need to get to the players, show your best tomorrow.
Now, you have your partner's backbone, and he has to come out and also show his best".
Unlike Bjorn, on the opposite side, Jim Furyk expects his players to play better individually than as a pair, with the exceptions of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the big entries the day before, was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he was defeated when Europe gave birth to the "Midnight Miracle".
"I remember every damn word out there", he said when asked how the captain, Ben Crenshaw, addressed his players on his final day in 1999.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle struts.
We've put our lineup together and put our guys out there as fashionable as we felt, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas evaded the challenge to face Rory McElroy in the main draw, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tom Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the top half of the standings.
"I came out with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through", Björn said when choosing his single.
The German warship was once again delayed
The new frigate was due to be delivered to the German Navy in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era battleships, but will not be delivered until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The receipt of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit newspaper quotes a military spokesman as saying.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but troubled post-delivery issues have made it difficult to complete this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, ordered by the fleet in 2007, are to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they'll have a range of powerful submarines, surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as certain stealth technologies, such as radar reduction, infrared and acoustic technologies.
Other important features are long storage periods - it should be possible to deploy new frigates away from home ports within two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the latest warships - designed to strengthen the German navy - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The Abbey F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the German Navy turned back a shipbuilder after his call.
The reason for the withdrawal is little known, but German media have noted a number of significant "program and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless if it were to be launched on a combat mission.
The software flaw was particularly significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship is operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the personal size of the obsolete Bremen-class frigate.
It also turned out that the ship was dramatically overweight, which reduced its effectiveness and limited the fleet's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Pfalz will be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
Along with the hardware problem, the cost of the whole project - including crew training - is another issue.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - up from 2.2 billion euros.
The subsequent problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the German fleet is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the fleet was actually "deprived of deployable ships".
The spokesman says the problem has accumulated over time as the old ships have been decommissioned but no replacement ships have been built.
He complained that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates would join the fleet.
The National Trust is keeping an eye on the secret life of the nightingale.
A new study in the highlands of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the landscape for food.
They hope that the findings will shed light on the unique behavior of flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
A study by the National Trust for Scotland's Science is tracking common and small frogs as well as brown-eyed frogs and daubenton frogs at Inverness Gardens in West Ross.
Special monitors will be installed at key locations throughout the property to monitor nightlife activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting mobile surveillance using hand-held detectors.
The experts analyze all the voice recordings to determine how often the chimpanzees call and which species do so.
Then a habitat map and a report are compiled to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the scale of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the bats and how each species uses them.
This information will allow them to determine the benefits of habitat management efforts such as nesting, how to preserve forested areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their habitat and their habitat.
Wind turbines and flax also pose risks, as do corrugated paper and some building materials chemicals, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The nightingales are not really blind.
However, their night-time hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to locate insects and identify obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for the conservation of over 270 historic sites, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the scams very seriously.
Matt has ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspections, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organisation also established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary, in the Trevi Estate at Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The land manager, David Thompson, says the land is the perfect area for them.
"Here in the wilderness we have a lot of space for the nightingales", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, lots of good habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about the nightingales yet, so the work we're doing here and on other land will help us understand more about what they need to grow".
He stresses the importance of checking the nests before undertaking conservation work on the property, as the unintentional destruction of one native bush can kill up to 400 young and young, which is likely to lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
The Gnomes are protected, and it is illegal to kill, kidnap, or harass them, or destroy their bunker.
Elizabeth Farrell, an officer of the Scottish Night Watch Trust, is calling on the community to help them.
He said, "We have a lot to learn about our moths and our species, we just don't know how they live".
Ronaldo is acquitted of rape charges and lawyers are suing a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people "want their own cover" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Majorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to Tava's 142 followers in a live Instagram video, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, called the allegations "fake news".
I was like, "No, no, no, no.
What you said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have "permissible reporting on suspicion of privacy", Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Scherz says the player is seeking compensation "for moral damage, with a proportionate amount of the severity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent years".
The incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room where he allegedly raped her anal, according to court papers filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo got down on his knees and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was praised by "one percent".
According to the evidence, Ronaldo admits that the couple had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and showed pictures of her injuries taken in the hospital, but then agreed to settle the dispute without a trial because she felt "fear of revenge" and feared becoming "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says he is now trying to avoid a fight because he is still traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid, accused of assault, and he was transferred to Italian giants Juventus this summer for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK is mourning the loss of car manufacturers.
The UK is bitter about losing its status as the world's leading car maker, says business secretary Greg Clark, after Brexit.
He added that it was significant that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, this would cause a temporary halt to production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of border delays, if the deal is not executed, will affect Brexit jobs.
The Burnaston plant (which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis) produced about 150,000 cars last year, and 90% of them were exported to other EU countries.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU and we end March, we'll see a shutdown of production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Burnton.
Other UK carmakers are concerned about leaving the EU without deals on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is announcing that it will close its mini-factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The key issue for the carmakers' views is the risks to the supply chain if the Brexit deal does not happen.
Toyota's production line operates on a so-called "frequency" basis, where spare parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both EU and UK suppliers for cars already ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, this could lead to border violations, which would lead to delays and parts shortages in the industry.
Toyota would not be able to stop inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would cease.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly calculated" to avoid such checks at the border.
"We have to get this deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to, as I said, be successful at this stage and also to talk about this opportunity in the future", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Based on the evidence from other manufacturers besides Toyota, we urgently need the ability to continue to implement highly successful supply chain measures.
Toyota could not comment on the period of the production shutdown, but warned that if it continued for a long time, it would lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the factory and eventually a reduction in jobs.
Peter Zuevalris, who has worked at the Burnaston facility for 24 years and is the head of the union at the plant, says that his members are very concerned about this fact.
The Prime Minister said: "We have presented a clear and rational plan for our future relations with the EU".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed.
According to a statement from the White House on Sunday, senior meetings between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed to next week" as the battle with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kauf continues.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aid and Russia, and potential legislative abuses by the president.
Whether Trump will challenge his deputy attorney general and threaten Mueller's independence will be a rumor in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, in an interview with the New York Times, Rosenstein said he had considered using a wire when talking to Trump, and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
He went to the White House last Monday, and according to the report, he was planning to resign.
So the meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York was scheduled for Wednesday.
Trump said he did not want to disagree with Rosenstein, but the meeting has since been postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was then hearing Kavanaugh and one of the women's representatives, Christine Blaise Ford, testify about his sex crimes.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh's complaint, and then put it to a Senate plenary vote.
On Sunday, Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The exact date is not yet set, the notice may be appointed this week, in my opinion the postponement of the meeting is related to the issues at the Supreme Court".
But we'll see, and we'll definitely bring the news to the media.
Several reporters are going to challenge the evidence: Sanders hasn't briefed the White House since 9/10.
The host asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not related to the unacceptability of the "action" of the TV reporters, but he also added: "I agree that this action is designed to achieve a special effect".
He later stated that the direct link between Trump and the media would increase.
The president is holding more Q&A sessions than any of his predecessors, the spokesperson added, without citing evidence, adding: "We've reviewed their count".
Sanders says that there will be briefings in the future, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of things, and as you can see, a lot of work has been done over the last few weeks, and we're also planning to do a briefing where you'll have the opportunity to speak directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly hears questions when he leaves the White House, or attends public hearings and high-level press conferences.
Special press conferences are rarely held.
This week in New York, the president is supposed to demonstrate why it's free to generate ideas and show original images to a gathering of reporters.
The Health Minister wrote to the EU employee at the NHS in Scotland about his concerns about Brexit.
The Health Minister has written to EU staff at the NHS in Scotland, expressing gratitude on behalf of the country and a desire to keep their jobs after Brexit.
MSP Jean Freeman wrote the letter at least six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the claimed compensation for EU citizens working in the public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer, negotiations have been underway between the EU and the United Kingdom, with a decision likely to be reached in the autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this could be a very inconvenient time for you.
So I want to remind you again how much I appreciate the contributions of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and other regions are sharing very valuable experiences and knowledge that will strengthen and improve healthcare practices, and benefit patients and communities in our country.
Scotland is, in fact, your homeland, and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrum undergoes surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Kristen Abercrum has undergone surgery after suffering a 31-27 injury in a game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee wide receiver Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player suffered an injury before halftime.
Yogi approached the sideline, and then this happened, which was triggered by Reed.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrumb oxygen on the spot before he was moved to the bench and taken for further examination.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrum is being prepared for surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harry added that he has no further information about the injury at this time and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine the location of the injury.
Abercrumb, a redshirt athlete, is playing his first season in Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He had five sacks on Saturday, and 18 of those in the season.
Foreign buyers will be spared higher overseas taxes when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers are spared higher roaming charges when they buy property in the UK with the extra cash used for the toxic layers under the new Tory plans.
The move will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in the UK's tax collector will be attributed to individuals who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The House of Commons estimates it will rise to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May's announcement today will see foreign buyers obliged to pay a higher foreign levy when buying property in the UK with extra cash to be used to help homeless citizens.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting younger voters with mortgages to provide more affordable housing and rely on higher-income citizens.
The increase in the tax collector will be attributed to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional cash to help the government's efforts to tackle the problems of homeless citizens.
The sub-tax, which is added to the existing external tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental houses, is set at three percent.
The House estimates that this will rise to £120 million a year.
13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-residents, driving up prices and hindering the entry of first-time homebuyers into the sector.
Many of the country's affluent neighborhoods, especially in the capital, have become so-called "demonstration cities", as most of them are bought by foreigners who are not in the country.
The new policy is being developed after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the foreign debt so that young people could buy their first homes.
He blames the big development companies for keeping prices high, and not using them, and urges Mrs. May to lift quotas on affordable housing.
Mr. Corbyn made a statement on the major reforms in the proposed real estate sector, controlling their rent-to-own and ending the indecent images.
It also intends to give the consuls more authority to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I was encouraged to dedicate my prime ministership to the British dream, and to make life better for the next generation.
And that means we're going to respond to the failure of our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it would not be right if we made it easier for non-UK residents or foreign companies to acquire real estate, as opposed to working UK residents.
For many people, buying their own home is a dream come true, and the humiliating dream of a night out in the open is a reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland.
Jack Ross, the leader of Sunderland, says his greatest ambition is to become the ruler of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, is enjoying a rebuild for the North Eastern club, who are currently in third place in the Premier League, and have been relegated to the top flight by three points.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light under the guidance of St Mirren for the final season of the Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B-line, which is what I wanted", Ross told BBC Scotland Sports.
I used to watch Scotland in the Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and it all brings me back to my childhood.
We will only take this opportunity if I succeed in running the club.
Ross's ancestors in Sunderland included the lawyer Dick, David Moyes, the three Allardycees, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kenny, Gus Poyet, and Paulo DiCanio.
The former Alloa Athletic player has said he is not immune to the discomfort of working with such famous faces at a big club, and has previously turned down initiatives from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, my success is determined by the desire to get this club back in the Premier League?"
If you look at the construction of this club and the infrastructure, there's no doubt that it's in the Premier League", he says.
It's not an easy task, but I think I'm a very successful manager, my club will be in the Premier League.
Ross began his career in management three years ago, initially as a senior assistant at Dubarton, and subsequently spent 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He subsequently helped Alloa to promotion to the Third Division and led St Mirren to the Championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels better than he did when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He remembers it as a real crossroads.
I really believe that management is the right thing to do, much more than playing.
It's weird, but I feel good, I make a reasonable income, and I've reached certain heights.
But the game is difficult.
You'll have a lot of challenges to overcome during the week.
I deal with the stress and pressure that is typical of my work, but I still don't think I'm a failure at management.
I've always been attracted to management, and I'm currently doing it. I feel comfortable.

According to the study, Saturday, 5:30 p.m., is the best time to have a pint.
The hot summer sun boosted the income of British pubs, but the storm burned down restaurant chains.
Pub and bar sales rose 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, according to calculations.
Peter Martin, the CGA business consultant who conducted the calculation, said: "Continued warm weather and England's unexpected World Cup appearance meant the same results in July as the previous month, when club revenues rose by 28 per cent and restaurants suffered greater losses".
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June worsened further in July.
I sold drinks in pubs and bars, and they got their positions up in proportion to the decline in restaurant ratings.
The food bars were hit by the heat, but not as badly as the restaurant operators.
It seemed that the citizens were just drinking.
While the sales of drinks in pubs and bars went up 6.6 percent in one month, the sales of food products went down three percent.
Paul Newman, a tourism analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we observed at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the most important factors in terms of domestic sales.
There's no doubt that restaurant groups will continue to struggle, as their sales are falling by 4.8 percent a year, which is especially painful in the context of the ongoing tax billing.
The long hot summer is not a good time for food operators, and time will tell whether the expected moderate temperatures in August will give us a breathable base.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly renovated establishments, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker tracks sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collecting and analysing information from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover in excess of £9 billion and is a recognised industry reference.

Twenty percent of the students say they use a Clean Core account for their parents to view, and they also have their own accounts.
One parent tracked down her 13-year-old daughter on a secret website where she offered to rape her.
According to a survey by the UK's Digital Awareness Seminar and Independent School Principals, 40 percent of pupils between the ages of 11 and 18 use two profiles, and half of them have permission to use personal profiles.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many young people are entering the online world unbeknownst to their parents and teachers".
Eileen Doyle is going to be the Athletes' Champion of Scotland.
Eild Doyle was elected to the Scottish Power Council as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a well-known Scottish strongman and chairman. Ian Beatt described the move as a good opportunity for those who want to benefit the sport based on his extensive experience in the last decade at international level.
"He is held in high regard in Scotland, the UK and the world of strength and conditioning, and we are confident that it will be beneficial for Scottish athletes to have him on the board", said Bittle.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be acting as an athlete's representative and hope to make a big contribution to the development of the sport in Scotland".
The American, who ran the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is a four-time Olympic gold medalist, is now a regular BBC commentator, struggling to move after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Just a month ago, I had a stroke.
I needed to move.
The doctors say time tells us when and how much I can recover.
With great effort, I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and now lead an active life.
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An ad for a breast pump comparing a mother to a cow is sharing an opinion online.
The breast pump company shared its opinion online with an advertisement comparing breast-fed cows to cow-fed cattle.
To celebrate the new launch, which is said to be the "world's first silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-style promotional video used to show the freedom that the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a basket of milk cows, to the tune of a song that includes the words, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see the cows", and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't the cows, these are my breasts".
The team goes, "Momom, mom, I'm feeding this to the kids, mom, mom, I'm burning my ladies".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
We think they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that they give up their babies a few days after birth.

Another commented: "It's definitely traumatic for both mother and child.
But why shouldn't they be used in a breast pump commercial for people who are having babies?
Someone added, "Such a waste of time".
Others were protecting the advertisement. One woman admits that she found the song "humorous".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I was a mother.
When I was out, I felt like a real cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it was.
It's a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement for mothers who smoke milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like cows".
This is not a commercial that criticizes or judges the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, we see women dancing with tubes in their lips.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that most women who smoke say they feel like cows.
And Elvie's pipe is completely unplugged, with no wires or fittings, and an unobtrusive lift, allowing women to move freely, hold their children in their arms, and even go outside during the fun.
Anna Ballarin, partner and ECD mother comments: "Elvie's tube is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In drawing the parallel between female self-expression and cow-breeding, we wanted to pump milk from the breast and bring all of its problems to the forefront, while demonstrating in a fun and exciting way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tube brings.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pipe has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium at a fashion show for designer Martha Yakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children moved peacefully to tent camps along the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, but the monthly border crossing has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration has introduced harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants who feared they would jeopardize their ability to stay in their country if they took the step of claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit fingerprints and their data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Alpens, the top immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally and a significant portion of them are criminal residents.
So we will continue to persecute these people", Mr. Alben said.
In order to speed up the process for the children, officials introduced new rules that some of them would have to appear before the court within one month of their arrest, rather than 60 days, as was the previous standard for asylum workers.
Many will appear via videoconference rather than in person to the immigration judge to announce their legal status.
Those who do not comply will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system over the past few months, the longer children are held in detention, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems have intensified in larger institutions like Tornillo, where there are signs that the child's struggles are being more ignored because of its size.
They also added that without giving children enough time to prepare emotionally and to say goodbye to their friends, moving their tents to the city could exacerbate the trauma that most are already battling.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey's "occupying forces" to withdraw their troops immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alim also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even as the country's war rages on for the eighth year.
Mulami, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "are being treated accordingly".
"They must go forth immediately and without any conditions", he told the congregation.
Mulami claimed that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011, is almost over.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy fight until it clears the whole territory of Syria" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and training both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in war-torn territory.
As for the refugees, Mullem said that the conditions for their return were good and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that forced the refugees not to return to their country.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel force has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement cancels a large-scale Russian-backed offensive by Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "bright deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who "will be eliminated".
UN spokesman Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee soon, including representatives from the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
In this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency early.
What will be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to the presidency!
At this point, there is no sign of any audience fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to -1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Meadows Show" on prime-time news nights has surpassed 3.5 million in cable ratings.

There is entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, more than anything else on television, the news from Washington can determine the future of Ross V. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Expression is a luxury that only a privileged spectator can have.
And yet, it goes beyond the knowledge of the informed citizen when you see for six hours the panel debate on the deep background used by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 Syracuse wooden bomber hat, and the rough descriptions of the effects of Storm Daniels on Trump's anatomy.
For example, I'll never see Super Mario the way I used to.

When I reached Mr. Fleis this week, it was a sunny day with 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of the Cayo, but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, nor could Brett Kavanaugh, who was brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and later before the Supreme Court, who was hanged.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows that day and people were saying, 'This is the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right".

Beyond the money, he's grown into a strict midterm of the House of Revolution.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is suffering from a cash flow, thanks to the restructuring of congressional districts that have taken two seats in the same race.
This newly remodeled subway in Pittsburgh County is surrounded by Democratic House member Conor Lamb, who won a runoff election last spring.
Lambie is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which partially coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally created in favor of the Republicans.
In the new 17th, the tour led to a reduction in campaign funding from the party finance department, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a celebrity in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow victory in the March general election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for a decade, and President Donald Trump defeated the county by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
Sanctions on El Salvador for U.S. support for China have been lifted
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing from Washington for a small amount of land.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama before the partners re-established the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "the final decision on the denial of recognition of Taiwan", Department spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But the fines were only for El Salvador, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American countries and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As local meetings developed, North American and Central American officials moved to a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following similar meetings last year, as a step forward in preventing immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively stop discussing sanctions for El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration is changing the venue.
And three American ambassadors have returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions on the terms of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by a third-party analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is now pretty significant evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reporting that his investigation is moving toward whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved in collusion with Russia during our election.
If Congress goes hand in hand, then Mr. Trump will be held accountable, just as he is preparing to address the electorate, and ultimately, a jury of his peers.
That's a lot, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable -- like his European counterparts.
We're all going to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, only the West for him to resist, rally and support the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
We have missed and missed the opportunity to prevent bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around this kind of inflation and the relentless march of democracy, accelerating or slowing.
Americans today face these turning points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump sacks Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is already in hot water after the newspaper reported that last year he decided to secretly run for president and speak out against his incompetence for the office he holds.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
"What should we do if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavala is not complete or fair - or if he has testified in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and circumstantial evidence?
And first of all, will it be a midterm vote for Congress that brings Trump to justice?
If we pass this test, democracy will continue through the long winter.
But I believe we can, from the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to hang this swastika of candles on the Sabbath table.
With that as a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrance is optimistic about the Vienna Rapids game.
On Thursday, Rangers hosted Vienna Rapids, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, would secure them a place to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Doran missed his debut in the season due to a knee injury, but he believes Rangers can use this as a substitute for better results in the future.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good side", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game because we thought we could get something and we got one point.
Maybe we could have done something at the end, but in the end, Frey was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we came out in the second half and we won.
Friday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good performance in the last game, but with the fans, I am sure we can achieve success and get a positive result.
Last year was really difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with the changes of the club, but now there is an optimistic factor.
The team is good, and the guys are really good; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward, put the past behind us and make it happen".
Women can't sleep because they're afraid of retirement savings.
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to care for themselves, a few of them talked about it with family members.
About half of the nationwide surveys say they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent say they've talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't even bother talking about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
That's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not know your wishes beforehand.
With your counselor and your family, to discuss where and how you want to get care, because that choice can be a big factor in determining cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include traditional long-term insurance policies, life insurance policies with hybrid cash value to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own property while you have the money.
Organize your legal documents: Leave the legal battles in the past.
Get a healthcare representative authorized to certify your representative who will monitor the quality of your healthcare and ensure that professionals meet your requirements in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the power of attorney for your finances.
You need to choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions and ensure that you pay your taxes if you become incapacitated.

The man fired multiple shots from a pneumatic weapon in the infrared.
The man was shot multiple times with a pneumatic pistol as he returned home at night.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers noted that the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, was an "accidental act".
The victim was not seen by his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palos on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the communication disruption, officials were unable to get information from the Donggala administration, an area north of Palo near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in the aftermath of the disaster in Palos.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongola, Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow peninsula on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is the north-easternmost point of Sulawesi Island along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline.
The administrative region under the province had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Moroval, on the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Tonga have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit West Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring, where earthquakes occur regularly.
There have been several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On August 26, an earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that devastated 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nia Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southeast Japan, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake occurs in the province of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people are reminded of the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: More than 500 people were killed by a powerful earthquake on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Treck Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on domestic violence charges, which contradict the domestic violence and resisting arrest report, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers' Service.
According to the police report, when the woman he knew tried to call the police and report a suspected crime, he snatched the phone from his hand.
According to KTUU, Palin is in the Mat-Su detention center and is under a $500 bail.
In his court appearance on Saturday, when asked to plead guilty, he stated that he was completely innocent, the networks reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means one year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which means one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first criminal case against the defendant.
In December 2017, she was charged with assaulting her father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police with a report of a possible attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a domestic violence report, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Her boyfriend claimed to have shot her in the face.
Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down, and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck in the center of Sulawesi, north of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos of the events are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palos when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are choosing a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terror attack.
The New York State Attorney's Office is seeking the death penalty for the New York City terrorist suspected of killing eight people, a rare sentence for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saypo, 30, allegedly used a rented car from Home Depot in October to attack pedestrians and cyclists along the Lower Manhattan West Side.
To seek the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sajal "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm on people, according to a written request for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of them face possible death sentences, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saigon on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, related to gang activity, used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, assault and car destruction.
The prosecution said the attack required "detailed planning and forethought", describing how it was carried out "with rage, cruelty and outrage".
"The discovery of the Saipula Khabiolavich caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevens, Am-Laura Decadati, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Herman Diego Mendoza and Alejandro and Pagnuccio, the announcement of the intentions of the states.
The five victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been 10 years since a criminal death penalty case was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in New York was the 1953 federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
The Uzbek resident did not express deep remorse after the attack, which occurred that day and for several months, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he did what he did well.
According to the indictment, Saifov told authorities that he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also demanded that ISIS flags be hung in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, a federal public defender in Saipou, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the death penalty, rather than life without parole, will only prolong the trauma caused by this incident for all involved", Patton said.
The treasure protection team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Tory MP has said that Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the people's army" at a protest conference in Toru today.
The former British leader said that politicians "must feel the heat" from the European Secession - as suggested by parliamentarian Theresa May, who should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bonn said in Birmingham that the UK would be "already gone" if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May, in keeping with her highly distinguished position, was emphasised by the pro-Remain Tories, who joined a separate protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his Chequers compromise plan against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies argued that he would try again to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said during the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted to repeal the checks.
He offered Mr. Farage to become a colleague and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I'm in favour of Brexit, but we need to get rid of the checkers.
When confronted by the European Union, he said, 'We did not fight in the world wars to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since 2016: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and should stay is a complete lie.'
Andria Jenkins, the Tory Brexiteer, was also at the march, and she told the press, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chekers are unpopular in the public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, they are unpopular in our party and among our activists who are actually taking to the streets and are looking at us first.
Please drop your checkers and start listening.
In Mrs May's urgent message, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs as long as they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that politicians should feel the heat "if they are going to overturn the decision made in the 2016 referendum".
'It's now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
"They are trying to do a no-deal Brexit and today we are here to say, 'We will not let that happen.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit, to feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, who defeated us in Brexit, and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and glorious United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham for two hours through the city centre.
Several activists have been holding anti-Brexit Tories banners since the launch of the groups this week.
Labour's Lord Adoni has mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they face at the opening of the conference after the launch of the party's app.
"These are the people who told us that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, no-clashes for borders, free trade in Ireland without borders", he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to "watch closely" the presidential race.
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election she would "carefully monitor" the presidential race.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future Saturday in West Massachusetts Ratchasia.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Dill, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chair in 2016.
He's been at the center of speculation about what he might get from Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, Holyoake hosted his 36th meeting with voters in a Ratchet format since Trump took office.
The audience asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and make a broken government that has a woman at the head of it".
An arrest has been made in the LSU shooting that ended with the deaths of the Sims.
In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. at the ET news conference.
On Friday, they aired a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the perpetrator in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed on the university's South Campus on Friday in Gameteniya.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wade protected his friend and was killed by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, with a gun in his hand, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 6-foot-6-inch junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to winning the World Championship after the team demands he win against Sebastian Fettel.
It was recently announced that Walter Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, and Mercedes orders were playing a big part in the race.
Bottas started well and almost missed out on Hamilton after he defended his position in the first two laps and led Wettle to his teammates' attack.
Vettel was the first to enter the pit stop and left Hamilton to join the traffic group code, which was to be the deciding factor.
Mercedes circled late and exited from behind the wheel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a few wheel-on-wheel collisions, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free, risking a stop after a double-step to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and on his 21st birthday was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then ran most of the race before mastering his salts to finish quickly and to attend Kim Reykonen in fourth place.
He eventually made it out on lap 44 of the boxing, but failed to improve his pace for the remaining 8 laps and Raykonen finished fourth.
It's a tough day, because Walter has done a fantastic job all week and he's been a real gentleman, so tell me about it.
The team worked particularly well to secure first and second places", said Hamilton.
That was really bad sex.
President Donald Trump heavily criticized Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for not having received a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that the events in the Senate had shown that the people were "disgusting, disgusting and deceitful".
"The only thing that can happen and the only beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and disgusting and disgusting and deceitful", he said.
"When you see the rallies and the leaks and when they say, 'Wow, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you release the information?
You remember his answer -- not the one that got away -- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I'm not going to.
I'm not a wimp".
Then, wait a minute.
We spread... No, we didn't", he added, quoting the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein detailing the charges brought against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, which were leaked in early September - but Feinstein denies the leak came from his office.
"I am not satisfied with Dr. Ford's accusations, nor am I excused from the Feinstein Committee", said Hill.
"He told me it was confidential, and I took it confidentially, as he asked".
But his refusal apparently did not please the president, who said during the meeting on Saturday: "I tell you, that was a really bad gesture.
It may not have been a complete failure, but it was the worst gesture I've ever seen".
In continuing to defend the nomination of three women who accused him of sexual assault, the president said Democrats were using the prosecution to their advantage.
"They are trying to regain power by any means.
You see the hate, the disgust, they don't care who they insult, who they use to gain power and control, MediaTimes reports.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for their loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants soon took the lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuiller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took the Giants to the home level before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard tied the score with Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured the win.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the Adam Kiffe crowd, who had come from far away to watch Dundee's 2-1 defeat of Belfast in Friday night's game.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
Dwyer scored the winning goal in the fourth, 3:35 minutes, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaul, thanks to a pass from David Rutherford, and Bowie doubled the gap four minutes later.
After the opening minutes, Sullivan scored a goal for the hosts at 13:10 of the game before being assisted by Mathieu Cooney to tie the score at 15:16.
Before the break, Dwyer had the Giants even more upset when he scored the second goal just after the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard once again returned the game with a strong shot in the 27:37 minute.
The combination of Coyne and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen advance Dundee to the second-half finish for the first time in the match, and he led his team to victory, finishing fifth in the final standings.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, play their next game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller dies trying to save hundreds of people on board an earthquake.
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller was posthumously hailed as a hero after he secured a safe landing for hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the tsunami that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continues to experience strong earthquakes and much of the city of Palo is in ruins.
But despite his colleagues running for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Guanavar Agunghi refused to leave his post at the heavily lit control tower at Mutyar Siss Al Jaffri Palos Airport.
He remained in place to ensure a safe flight for Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped off the airlock when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation Authority spokesman Johannes Siriti said the decision saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikappan in Kalimantan to take him to another city, to a larger hospital.
Sadly, he died the morning before the helicopter reached Paulo.
"We were left with a sincere feeling", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the Disaster Management Agency says access to the towns of Donggala, Sighi and Butong is restricted.
"The number of victims is expected to continue to rise, as many bodies were still under the rubble and many were not yet accessible", said a spokesman for Sotopo Puro Nguroho.
Waves that reached 20 feet [6 m] swept through Palo, leading to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Riza Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulances are bringing bodies in.
Clean water is not enough".
The mini-markets were looted everywhere".
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to see there.
"It's a tragedy, but it could have been worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palouse and told the country's armed forces: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
In Indonesia, more than 550 people died in the earthquake that struck Lombok earlier this year.
Air New Guinea reports that one person is missing after a plane crashed in the Micronesia Lagoon.
The airline, which operated a flight in the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia, is now reporting one person as missing without a trace, after it finally announced that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from the sunken plane.
Air Newigny said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon, he was unable to correctly calculate the male passengers.
The airline says it has been working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide passenger details such as age or nationality in a timely manner.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to take off from Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were taken to hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The exact sequence of events remains uncertain.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane crashed into a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was trying to fly.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane was flying too low.
"It's very good", says Jaines.
Jaines said that he and others managed to get out of the escape hatch from a water-filled plane that was still sinking.
He said the hijackers were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor injury to his head.
The United States Navy said that sailors at a nearby dock also assisted in the rescue effort, taking the boat to shore before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air New Guinea.
The analyst is running a timeline of the night she was burned alive.
On Saturday, prosecutors filed a case against a man accused of the 2014 murder of a woman in Mississippi by burning her alive.
The United States Department of Justice analyst, Paul Roulet, gave a few hours of testimony as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together a timeline of the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette said he had obtained location data from a few cell phones that showed Telles and Jessica were together on the night of the murder, contradicting his previous claims, Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber, when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telles was telling the truth when he said he was in a truck in Sanford at night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Telles stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of his death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other a week.
Roulette stated that some time after Chambers' death, Telles deleted Chambers's messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense should begin their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that this trial should be adjourned to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop is far from political ideas and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common have recently become a renaissance in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York City resident sued a couple for a "racist" text
A New York City cousin sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misjudged text from her mother, in which she complained that she was "another black person".
The spouses deny they are racists, who liken the lawsuit to "rape".
Lynce Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when it was revealed that her new child care provider, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There is no other black person", Mrs. Plasco-Flakesman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Morris.
After realizing the mistake, the woman who was found in the hospital released Ms. Morris, saying that the nurse who had been taken away from her, who was African-American, was doing her job poorly and was waiting for a Filipino instead, the New York Post reported.
His mother was paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home by Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for his release and demanding compensation of $350 a day for the six months he was originally hired without a contract.
"I want to show them, see that you don't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusations that they were racist by saying that Morris' release was reasonable because they feared that Maddie could no longer be trusted after they had been abused.
"My husband sent her something he didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you be willing to hand your children over to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
All right, what?"
In comparison to the "rape" claim, Plasko stated that his wife was only two months pregnant and was in a very difficult situation.
"Would you date someone like that?
It's not a very pleasant business", the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately condemned the couple on social media, where they were accused of behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not favor the speaker, says the new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was published, wrote: "It's hard to imagine yourself in someone else's shoes when you first read this before it's published.
Now it's very exciting to know that we know about Paddington's tremendous success".
To say that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a book on a small toy can, would be optimistic, because his work was rejected, and he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet-bitten" a year after his death.
Of Paddington, whom she refers to as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly enthusiastic about his possible success.
"He was a very quiet person and he was not a conceited person", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child describe something that you're proud of, but it's not really what you've done.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always respected Paddington himself".
My son was dying, and I got a phone call to say goodbye.
On the flight, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her.
"Naddy regularly complained that it was really bad, that she did not want to do it", says Ednan-Lapéroux.
"Then Nadine called me to say that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors gave her for her heartbeat was slowly being broken down and left her body.
He died and everything went to hell.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn't whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and loved ones.
I should have kept it all".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapéroux, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - despite the ordeal that had come upon her.
"No one knew", he said.
"I was so upset that I cried.
It's hard to explain, but it was during that flight that I felt this tremendous compassion for Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Open cards for sad ladies to eliminate suicide from bridges.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to end suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up postcards on the Wales Bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers where people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective chef-transformer with a smile.
"Everyone recognized him with a smile.
They always said that his smile would light up any room".
But before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that there won't be an effect.
Mrs. Davis created the cards so that people would know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't be silent - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphrey, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davis' for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't tell her that she was feeling bad or depressed or anything like that", he said.
"A few days before he was born, we noticed a change in his personality.
On Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
She said that her death was a great trauma for them, but they had to pass it on: "It creates a huge hole in the family.
We'll follow him to tears.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in the balance, the FBI is investigating.
"I thought that by being able to do what he asked for - a time-limited investigation, within a limited scope - we could have some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would break up over a party-wide bribery scandal.
Why did Mr. Kavallo and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of desire is due to time.
The midterm elections will be held in five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans go badly, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to get the person they want elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators and lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and who met his wife, Ashley, when she was serving as Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to terminate the relationship and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean exiles is dwindling under the umbrella of the regime.
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Koreans defecting to South Korea has declined, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 evictions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and high tariffs imposed by smugglers were important factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers dissidents to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on halting nuclear disarmament.
This came after the historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, when they agreed to work on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such a situation, we cannot disarm unilaterally", Mr. Reem said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh a mystery, and has said he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" woman, saying she is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of her temper.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't, but I think if a woman acted on it, she would be called 'sterile,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Canadian testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanagh emotionally denied allegations that he had had sexual relations with Dr. Christina Blase Ford in his youth.
In his opening remarks, Kawano was very emotional, sometimes almost crying and choking while talking about his family and school.
She also denounced Democrats in committee and called the accusation made by her father a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he is biased against democracy.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was upset when asked if he would try Kavanaugh's impeachment, if he would celebrate, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court that he's in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roy V. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn any Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time when a hysterical, biased person will go to court and expect us to say how wonderful it is", Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's a fair conversation, a fire burning for months and years, and he can't show it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mr. Steinheim told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was somewhere in government, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm mad at you".
And then he just kept going.
And I thought that was wonderful".
Tears are allowed in part as an expression of anger because it is fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my bitterest memories of my early male-dominated work was when I found myself crying from unwritten rage, and an elderly lady grabbed me on the cheek -- a cold manager I always dreaded -- and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let anyone see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored and they'll be happy they got what they wanted".
Patricia Schrader, then Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an unmarried affair on the boat called Monkey Business, and left the Asparagus, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, decided there was no reason why she should not run for president herself.
"It was not a wise decision", he told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"Asperes had a child as a candidate, the least they wanted was another candidate.
Someone said "the whale and the dwarf child".
Because it was too late for the campaign and he was behind a fundraising campaign, he promised that he would not take part in the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave the men $1,000 only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When he came out and announced that he would not formally campaign, he was so overwhelmed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism -- that he was furious.
"You think I had a nervous breakdown", said Mr. Schroeder of the press reaction to it.
"You think Clinix was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my headstone?
"Did he cry?"
How can a US-China trade war be good for China?
The original causes of the U.S.-China trade war have been eroded, and while the end of the fighting is still far off, the cold war between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded to each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised that the U.S. will be in the eye of the storm, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to freeze anytime soon.
For Washington, to be forced to back down is to comply with demands, and, alas, for the United States, publicly backing down may be very uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to play its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of an economic downturn in any country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", says Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' to receive refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to accept returning refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alim said conditions were improving in the country.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alim said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that had financed the insurgency.
Europe celebrates winning the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. now has six losses in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Michelson, who had been trying to win most of the tournament, shot his first shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, before losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming the first player in history to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was created in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated 5-4 by the lowest ranked Danish player in the European team, Torbjørn Olesen.
The world's highest-rated player, Dustin Johnson, gave 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia of Spain, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, won the tournament in European history with 25.5 points.
"I used to cry, but now I can't stop.
It was a rough year.
So I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm happy, I'm so happy that I got the cup back.
"It's a team effort, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, full of emotion, after winning Europe.
He handed the trophy to fellow golfer John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Wood 2-1 in a one-player game.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
The odd statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major titles, is only matched by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled for weeks to find a face, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finus, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk, after his team's decisive play, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning was the moment we hit Europe a little bit.
We destroyed it.
We bowed to Thomas
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to earn your keep.
We are better".
